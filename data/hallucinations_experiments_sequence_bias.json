He said that there were no reports of anyone injured or trapped. Video showed both smoke and bright orange flames. Firefighters took up positions around the affected buildings, spraying water from the periphery. Weimer told CNN that authorities didn't know what had caused the fire, which had gone to at least four alarms.

McLean told Rolling Stone that it was time to part with the manuscript. \"I'm going to be 70 this year,\" the singer and songwriter said in February. \"I have two children and a wife, and none of them seem to have the mercantile instinct. I want to get the best deal that I can for them. It's time.\" Over the years, \"American Pie\" has become one of the most dissected and argued-about songs in the pop music canon. McLean has said that the opening lines were inspired by the death of Buddy Holly, but after that, it's all been conjecture -- which hasn't stopped a marching band's worth of analysts from trying to parse the symbols in the 8-minute, 33-second opus. Is the jester Bob Dylan? The football game Vietnam? The \"girl who sang the blues\" Janis Joplin? (One thing's certain: Buddy Holly's plane was NOT named \"American Pie.\") \"Over the years I've dealt with all these stupid questions of 'Who's that?' and 'Who's that?' \" McLean said. \"These are things I never had in my head for a second when I wrote the song. I was trying to capture something very ephemeral and I did, but it took a long time.\" The song catapulted the former folk singer to headliner status. The song hit No. 1 in early 1972, despite its length. (The 45-rpm single split the song in half on its A and B sides.) The draft that was auctioned is 16 pages: 237 lines of manuscript and 26 lines of typed text, according to Christie's. It includes lines that didn't make the final version as well as extensive notes -- all of which should be revealing, McLean said. The record for a popular music manuscript is held by Bob Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" which sold for $2 million in June. Opinion: What's so great about 'American Pie'?\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The manuscript of \"American Pie\" by Don McLean, which includes 237 lines of manuscript and 26 lines of typed text, sold for $1.2 million at Christie's auction, making it the third highest price for an American literary manuscript. McLean, who turned 70 in 2022, decided it was time to sell the manuscript to provide for his family. The 8-minute, 33-second song, which hit No. 1 in 1972, has been the subject of much analysis due to its cryptic lyrics. McLean has said the opening lines were inspired by the death of Buddy Holly, but the rest of the song's meaning remains a mystery. The record for a popular music manuscript is held by Bob Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" which sold for $2 million in 2014.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 196 words:\nThe outlines of a nuclear deal with Iran are in place. Unfortunately, it seems like too many in President Barack Obama's administration have forgotten that the only reason this terrorist-supporting state came to the negotiating table in the first place was because of tough sanctions imposed by the U.S. Congress. Indeed, the reality is that President Obama is giving up enormous leverage in his nuclear deal with Iran -- and I worry we will lose it for good. Bleeding money, and faced with falling oil prices, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei gave his government rare permission to bargain with the \"Great Satan\" -- the United States. But just as U.S. and European sanctions were forcing Iran to the nuclear crossroads, President Obama has given Tehran an easy exit. For Khamenei, the \"framework\" announced last week looks like a win-win: He gets to keep his nuclear infrastructure, and in return gets billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Congress offered a better strategy when the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, and I introduced a bill to hit Tehran with its toughest sanctions yet. Unfortunately, this bill -- which passed the House in a 400-20 vote -- was blocked in the Senate last year, despite the fact that it would have sharpened the Ayatollah's choice: Dismantle your nuclear weapons program or see your economy collapse. President Obama once had a tougher line, when in 2012 he said: \"The deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program. It's very straightforward.\" But the framework announced last week does nothing of the sort. Negotiated between Iran and the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, the framework concedes that Iran can maintain \"a mutually defined enrichment program,\" operate thousands of centrifuges, and continue its research and development of nuclear technologies. The deal currently on the table would hand Tehran billions of previously sanctioned funds, filling the coffers of the world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism, with strongholds in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon. Meanwhile, the strictest restrictions on Iran's enrichment will expire in only 10 years, despite the President receiving a letter from 367 Members of Congress -- both Democrats and Republicans -- in which we insisted that \"verifiable constraints on Iran's nuclear program must last for decades.\" The President admitted as much when he conceded that \"in year 13, 14, 15, they have advanced centrifuges that enrich uranium fairly rapidly, and at that point the breakout times would have shrunk almost down to zero.\" But as bad as these concessions are, the most concerning aspect of the April 2 deal is that it lacks tough safeguards to stop Iran from cheating. The key question is this: Will the inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency be allowed to inspect these military sites without warning? Because if the IAEA cannot conduct \"anytime, anywhere\" inspections, Iran will be able to \"sneak out\" to a bomb. It has been done before. Remember, in 1994, when President Bill Clinton told us he had struck a deal with North Korea that would \"make the United States, the Korean Peninsula, and the world safer\"? President Clinton sounded a little too much like the current Secretary of State John Kerry, when he promised that the North Korea agreement \"does not rely on trust\" and that \"compliance will be certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\" Twelve years after these assurances, North Korea detonated its first nuclear bomb. Iran could easily do the same. The best predictor of its future behavior is its past behavior -- between 2004 and 2009, the Iranian government built a huge centrifuge facility named Fordo under a mountain deep in the Iranian desert. Luckily for the world, Western intelligence agencies discovered Tehran's deception. But we cannot rely on such luck in the future, particularly when Iran still hasn't come clean about its history of secret weapons development and is still dodging basic questions from the IAEA. Let's not forget the other things Iran has been doing while its diplomats have been bargaining with the U.S. and its partners. While Iran was showing its friendly new face to the world, it has simultaneously been helping Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad kill his own people, training and funding the terrorist group Hezbollah, which aims to annihilate Israel, and supporting the Houthis, who started a civil war and overthrew the government in Yemen -- one of America's more reliable counterterrorism partners in the region. If President Obama is going to hand over billions of dollars to a regime that behaves like this, run by a man who publicly declares: \"Death to America,\" it has to be a better deal. The framework we have before us keeps Iran's nuclear door well and truly open.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The nuclear deal with Iran, which is currently being negotiated, has raised concerns that the U.S. is giving up significant leverage. Iran came to the negotiating table due to tough sanctions imposed by the U.S. Congress, but President Obama's administration seems to have forgotten this. The framework of the deal allows Iran to keep its nuclear infrastructure and receive billions of dollars in sanctions relief. A bill passed in the House in 2015, which aimed to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, was blocked in the Senate. The deal's restrictions on Iran's enrichment will expire in 10 years, and it lacks sufficient safeguards to prevent Iran from cheating. Iran's past behavior, such as building a secret centrifuge facility under a mountain in the 2000s, raises concerns about its future intentions. Additionally, Iran continues to support terrorism and destabilize the Middle East through its actions in Syria, Hezbollah, and Yemen. Critics argue that the deal keeps Iran's nuclear door open and does not do enough to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nCharleston, South Carolina (CNN)Police officers Saturday accompanied the hearse carrying the body of Walter Scott to his South Carolina funeral service, where hundreds of mourners celebrated his life and death as a catalyst for change in America. A pair of officers on motorcycles were part of the large procession delivering the father of four -- who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer -- to a service open to the public. An overflow crowd gathered on a humid and occasionally rainy April afternoon at W.O.R.D. Ministries Christian Center in Summerville, which has a capacity of about 300 people. The flag-draped casket of the U.S. Coast Guard veteran was wheeled inside the church as Scott's relatives and friends followed. Some dabbed tears; others embraced. Hundreds, including local officials, assembled inside the packed sanctuary -- in corridors, under an awning at the entrance, wherever they could stand. Silence filled the vast space as Scott's daughter Samantha read a poem of love dedicated to her father. Anthony Scott said God had selected his brother as a candidate for change in America. \"The change will come,\" he said, bringing to the crowd to its feet. The head of the church, George Hamilton, spoke of how Scott had brought members of his family to the church, of the agony of not only losing a family member but having to watch it happen on video. The death of Scott, who was black, at the hands of a white police officer was \"motivated by racial prejudice,\" Hamilton said. It was \"an act of overt racism.\" \"Hate came because Walter was an African-American,\" he said. Hamilton said his remarks were not meant as an indictment of law enforcement, but he singled out the officer who killed Scott as a \"disgrace to the North Charleston Police Department.\" \"There is gong to be change,\" he said. \"Walter's death will not be in vain.\" After the service, pallbearers gently lifted Scott's casket into the hearse. Crowds poured from the church. A slow-moving procession of black cars then made its way to Live Oak Memorial Gardens in Charleston for the private burial. Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, said the death represented more than an race issue. \"It's a human issue,\" he said. \"We're getting emails from people in Arkansas telling us, 'I'm a white male, and I'm supporting this family.' Their son is going to be remembered for changing the way we look at each other.\" On Friday night, Scott's open casket was draped with an American flag, and he was in a dark suit for his private visitation in Charleston. A Dallas Cowboys banner -- his favorite NFL team -- was placed outside the casket, and a figurine of a Cowboys player stood at his side. But Scott's family was missing. They needed privacy, said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley, who attended. A week ago, Scott was killed in North Charleston after getting pulled over for a broken taillight. A passer-by caught the shooting on cell phone video, and Officer Michael Slager was swiftly charged with murder. He was fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted. Who was Walter Scott? The video shows Scott running from an officer, who fires eight shots. Scott is struck five times; he falls to the ground. \"Nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer's life or the life of another was threatened,\" National Urban League President Marc Morial said. \"The question here is whether the use of force was excessive.\" But one witness is speaking of a struggle before the shooting. And at least one expert believes a murder charge may not hold up. On Thursday, Gwen Nichols told CNN's Brian Todd that she saw Scott and Slager scuffling at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" Nichols said. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying 'Stop!' \" Nichols' account has similarities to Slager's. He had told investigators that he had tussled with Scott over his Taser and that he feared for his safety. A timeline of events. Criminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slager's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case. \"Defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- (that) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation, a physical altercation with a suspect,\" Callan said. \"And that would constitute manslaughter under law, as opposed to murder, and it makes a huge difference in sentencing.\" In South Carolina, a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation. But the account from the witness who recorded the cell phone video, Feidin Santana, paints a different picture. He was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott, he said, who was on the ground. Santana said he could hear the sound of a Taser in use. He said he didn't see Scott go after the Taser, as Slager initially claimed. He said he believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana said. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana started recording shortly after that. Investigators from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division found troubling inconsistencies from the very start, it said in a statement. \"We believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter,\" division Chief Mark Keel said in a statement. \"The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions.\" Slager's lawyer, Andy Savage, has complained that he \"has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has.\" Savage's office said in a statement that it has yet to receive \"any investigative documents, audio or video tapes, other than a copy of Mr. Slager's arrest warrant.\" The news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that Slager belongs to \"is no longer involved in the case.\" Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said Slager's wife, Jamie, who is eight months' pregnant, and his mother had a visit with him at the county detention center Friday.  Slager was being held in isolation and being \"monitored for his mental health,\" Cannon said. In a statement, one of Slager's lawyers said the meeting lasted about an hour. \"His wife and mom were tearful but strong, and they were all very grateful for the chance to see him in person, even if separated by a thick pane of glass,\" the statement said. \"They held up family photos -- and even Jamie's ultrasound from earlier that day -- to remind him of all those who love him. Throughout the visit, Michael was focused on Jamie and their baby and was very relieved to know that she is being shown so much love and support by their families.\" A second video, taken from a police dash cam, has also emerged from the day Scott died. It shows moments before  the shooting, when things seemed to be going smoothly between Scott and Slager. Scott apparently tells the officer that he has no insurance on the vehicle, and Slager returns to his car to do paperwork. Then Scott gets out of the car and runs out of the camera's frame. Scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop, according to court records. That was why he ran, lawyers for the family said after the funeral service. U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, told reporters outside the service that Scott lost a $35,000-a-year job the first time he was jailed for failing to pay child support. \"He said it was the best job he's ever had,\" Clyburn said. \"Now you have to ask ... if you want to collect child support, there's got to be income. And you ain't going to make much income from jail. It seems to me that we need to take a look to how to deal with that issue without causing unemployment and the loss of freedom.\" On Friday afternoon, police met with a man who was in Scott's car, but the passenger's name wasn't in a police report obtained by CNN. He was detained briefly after the shooting, one officer wrote in the report. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said he was a co-worker and friend. But he did not identify the passenger by name. On Friday, a few mourners trickled into the Fielding Home for Funerals. A white banner with a blue star near Scott's casket displayed his favorite NFL team. It said: \"Tradition, the Cowboys way.\" \"This is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community,\" said Riley, the mayor. \"It breaks everyone's hearts.\" CNN's Polo Sandoval and Martin Savidge reported from Charleston, and Ben Brumfield and Ray Sanchez reported and wrote in Atlanta and New York.\n\noutput:",

The person responsible is the man's mother, who on Sunday faced a host of charges after allegedly abandoning her son and catching a bus to Maryland to see her boyfriend, said Philadelphia police Lt. John Walker. Low temperatures reached the mid-30s during the week, and rain was reported in the area Wednesday and Thursday. The man is unable to communicate how he came to be in the park, but Walker told reporters that the man's mother, whom he did not identify for CNN, left him there Monday morning. \"Sometime at 11 a.m., the mother went to visit her boyfriend down in Maryland, over in Montgomery County, and we believe she placed the child into Cobbs Creeks Park,\" Walker said at a news conference. Walker told CNN the man was transported to Presbyterian Hospital, but CNN affiliates reported he was being treated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He suffered eye problems, dehydration, malnutrition and a cut to the back that has raised infection concerns, the lieutenant told reporters. \"This kid's obviously a fighter,\" Walker said during a Saturday news conference. \"It's just unbelievable how we found him out there last night. To see that kid laying there, it's heartbreaking to see another human, especially a mother, can treat someone like that.\" Officials at Philadelphia's School of the Future, which the man attends, became concerned when he didn't show up for classes and tried to contact his mother but eventually reached an aunt, CNN affiliate WPVI reported. When police tracked down the mother, she told them her son was with her, Walker said. \"She indicated to both family members and the police officers that the child was with her down with her boyfriend in Maryland,\" he said. The boyfriend was not aware of what happened, Walker told CNN affiliate KYW-TV. The mother now stands charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, reckless endangerment of another person, neglect of a care-dependent person, unlawful restraint, kidnapping and false imprisonment, the station reported. Walker told reporters she bore \"clear criminal liability in this case.\" Maryland police took her into custody on Sunday, and she will face the charges in Philadelphia following an extradition hearing, WPVI reported. There was no reason for the man to suffer, Walker told philly.com, because the mother had sisters willing to take care of him. Two of his aunts, who have tried to obtain guardianship of him, were staying with him at the hospital, police told the website. The mother has another child, a 16-year-old, who is also being taken care of by family members, WPVI reported. The mother's arrest was only the beginning of the investigation, Walker told reporters. Authorities are interested in learning more about \"how this kid was cared for, and what actions were taken and providing of services by different agencies.\" CNN's Carma Hassan contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

Investigators are looking into the possibility, said Goldsboro police Sgt. Jeremy Sutton. He did not explain what may have made it a hate crime. The victim -- Ron Lane, whom officials said was a longtime employee and the school's print shop operator -- was white, as is the suspect. Lane's relatives said he was gay, CNN affiliate WNCN reported. The suspect, Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, worked with Lane as part of a work-study program, but was let go from the program in early March due to poor attendance, college President Kay Albertson said Tuesday. On Monday, Stancil walked into the print shop on the third floor of a campus building, aimed a pistol-grip shotgun and fired once, killing Lane, according to Sutton. Stancil has tattoos on his face. Sutton said investigators are looking into whether he is part of a white supremacist gang. He has no previous criminal record, authorities said. Sutton said Stancil fled on a motorcycle after the shooting and ultimately abandoned it in a highway median. Then, Stancil continued on to Daytona, Florida, but authorities don't know how he traveled, Sutton said. He was arrested just after 1 a.m. Tuesday, after he was found sleeping on a beach, about 550 miles (885 kilometers) from Goldsboro. Volusia County Beach Patrol had approached him for violating the city's ordinance against sleeping on the beach. He had a knife, police said. He was taken into custody without incident. Authorities in North Carolina expect to bring him back to face charges. Wayne Community College, a two-year school, has a student population of 3,837, according 2013 figures from the National Center for Education Statistics. Slightly more than half the students are part-time. Crime statistics from the center's website show no killings, assaults, robberies or motor vehicle thefts between 2011 and 2013. There were three arrests for illegal weapons possession in 2012 and three in 2013.\n\noutput:",

Last week, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found guilty on all 30 charges he faced related to the bombings at the 2013 race and the dramatic violence that dragged out for days afterward. A look at all of the charges. The sentencing phase begins Tuesday, a day after this year's edition of the landmark race. It is expected to last four weeks. The 13th Juror: Now it gets real. In a front-page opinion piece in The Boston Globe, Bill and Denise Richard wrote about the toll taken on their family after the death of their 8-year-old son, Martin. Their daughter, Jane, also was severely injured. \"Our family has grieved, buried our young son, battled injuries, and endured numerous surgeries -- all while trying to rebuild lives that will never be the same,\" they said in the Globe column titled \"To end the anguish, drop the death penalty.\" \"We sat in the courtroom, day after day, bearing witness to overwhelming evidence that included graphic video and photographs, replicated bombs, and even the clothes our son wore his last day alive.\" They said they understood the \"heinousness and brutality of the crimes committed.\" \"We were there. We lived it. The defendant murdered our 8-year-old son, maimed our 7-year-old daughter, and stole part of our soul.\" But now the Richards are urging the Justice Department to bring the case to a close. \"We are in favor of and would support the Department of Justice in taking the death penalty off the table in exchange for the defendant spending the rest of his life in prison without any possibility of release and waiving all of his rights to appeal,\" they wrote. They go on to say: \"We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives. We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring.\" Martin Richard and two others were killed and more 200 people wounded when a pair of bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other at the finish line on April 15, 2013. Tsarnaev was convicted last week, while his brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a shootout with police two years ago. The Richards never mention Tsarnaev by name. They stress that they were only speaking for themselves when they argue against the death penalty. \"We believe that now is the time to turn the page, end the anguish, and look toward a better future -- for us, for Boston, and for the country,\" they wrote.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The parents of Martin Richard, the youngest victim of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, have appealed to the Justice Department to remove the death penalty from the sentencing of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted last week on all 30 charges related to the bombings and subsequent violence. The Richards, who lost their 8-year-old son and saw their 7-year-old daughter severely injured, wrote an emotional op-ed in The Boston Globe, detailing the toll the tragedy has taken on their family and urging the government to spare Tsarnaev's life in exchange for him spending the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole or appeal. The sentencing phase begins on March 21, and the Richards hope that ending the pursuit of the death penalty will bring closure and allow them to move forward.",

The aircraft went down overnight Monday about 2 miles east of the Central Illinois Regional Airport in Bloomington, McLean County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Bill Tate said. That's about 5 miles from the campus of Illinois State, where Ward and Leetch both worked. It was not immediately known who else was on the aircraft, which the National Transportation Safety Board tweeted was a Cessna 414. The plane was coming back from the NCAA Final Four championship game in Indianapolis, according to Illinois State athletics spokesman John Twork. \"The ISU community is reeling from the loss,\" Twork said. The last post from a Twitter account that purportedly belongs to Ward features pictures from Lucas Oil Stadium, where Duke beat Wisconsin in the title game. There's also a picture of a small plane with the words, \"My ride to the game wasn't bad #indy2015f4.\" In a statement, Illinois State University President Larry Dietz remembered Ward and Leetch as \"well-respected and much-loved colleagues in our athletics department\" in the crash near Bloomington. \"Words cannot fully express the grief that is felt in the wake of such a tragedy,\" Dietz said. \"We move between shock and profound sadness.\" A standout player at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in his hometown between 1996 and 2000, Ward played professionally in China alongside Yao Ming before getting into coaching. He was part of the staffs at Jacksonsville State University, the University of Mississippi and, for one year, in China before coming to Illinois State as an assistant prior to the 2012 season. He was promoted to associate head coach in May 2014, according to his official bio. Coming from Arkansas State University, Leetch joined ISU in 2005 as an athletic director for development before assuming a number of other roles through 2011, his bio notes. Leetch left the Illinois school to serve as director of athletics at Whitworth University in Spokane, Washington, then came back in June 2013 as ISU's deputy director of athletics. He was in charge of the Redbirds' athletics communications and video production units, and had a hands-on role in its football, men's basketball, golf and baseball programs. Athletic Director Larry Lyons described Leetch as \"a shining star in the business,\" while lauding Ward as \"a talented coach and recruiter\" with a big personality who was loved by fans. \"There is no play in the playbook for times like these,\" Lyons said. \"We will miss Aaron and Torrey deeply, and we will support their families in any way that we can.\" People we've lost in 2015.\n\noutput:",

About 4,500 people have been isolated by flood waters as \"the roads are cut off and we won't be able to reach them for a few days,\" Michael Langley, spokesman for the New South Wales State Emergency Service said. Devastating winds lashed cars and homes. The storm system also brought destructive flooding that washed away houses and brought down trees onto streets and buildings. The emergency services have been slammed with 13,000 calls for help due to flooding and have carried out 144 rescue tasks. The powerful storm has already claimed four lives, according to New South Wales Police. The dangerous conditions have prompted the police department to issue pleas on social media for people to not attempt driving through flooded areas. The heavy flooding prompted school and college closures and disruptions to public transportation. The adverse weather was caused by an intense low pressure system, said Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. The strongest wind gusts peaked at 135 km/h (85 mph) and it was estimated that about 200 millimeters (7.87 inches) of rainfall fell in the area on Tuesday. Transport NSW, which provides public transportation throughout the New South Wales area, issued a warning that many public services across the region have been disrupted because of the weather. It also posted a video on its Facebook page showing CCTV footage of a flood waters rising in a train station. Samantha Mancuso was driving in her neighborhood of Liverpool, a suburb in Sydney on Wednesday, when she noticed gallons of water pouring into the streets. She said Joe Broad Reserve, a nearby park, was flooded. The severe weather caused a local creek to break its banks and now the flooding is seeping into the neighborhood. Water levels at the park reached 2.6 meters (8.5 feet) earlier in the morning, but have slightly receded, she said.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nBoston (CNN)Adrianne Haslet-Davis and her husband, Adam Davis, were standing near the finish line on the day of the Boston Marathon bombing. Her feet were sore from wearing 4.5-inch heels. Still, they walked to Boylston Street to watch the runners. \"We were so in love and happy together,\" she told a federal jury Wednesday. It was the second day the Boston jury heard a procession of heartbreaking loss -- the survivors and families of those killed when twin bombs planted by the pair of brothers named Tsarnaev exploded near the finish line. The jury must decide whether bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. Haslet-Davis and Davis, who had just returned from a tour in Afghanistan with the Air Force, were steps away from the explosion near the Forum restaurant. She recalled the force of the blast that killed three people and injured over 200 that April day in 2013. She knew right away it was a terrorist attack. Screams and heavy smoke filled the air. She couldn't hear her own screams. She thought she was dead. When her husband, who also was injured, lifted her leg, he too let out a scream. She said she thought he was in shock. She rolled over onto her stomach and crawled over broken glass, shredding her arms. She dragged herself to the Forum. \"I saw all five of my toes, but I saw a lot of blood,\" she said. \"I didn't see my ankle.\" A ballroom dancer, Haslet-Davis' left leg would later be amputated below the knee. Inside the Forum, Haslet-Davis begged for whiskey. \"I just wanted the pain to go away. I only begged for the whiskey when I thought I was going to die.\" When someone removed Adam's shoe, an artery was spurting blood. His face got whiter and whiter, she said. His eye rolled back. She thought he was dead. At a hospital, she called her parents on her cellphone. She told them she was in a terrorist attack. \"I don't think I have a left foot anymore,\" she told her father. \"I'm in really bad shape and I really need to talk to you because this might be it.\" Her father told her he was driving and it was illegal to pull over. \"I don't care if it's illegal. I need to talk to you because these might be our last words. I said I was in a terrorist attack at the Boston Marathon and Adam is dead and this might be it for me.\" Haslet-Davis told the jury that, at the Forum, her husband kept telling her he was sorry. \"That was all he could say. That he loved me. He was so sorry.\" Her husband, she said, has since \"bravely admitted himself into a mental facility at the VA hospital.\" After her testimony, Haslet-Davis walked slowly off the stand. She appeared to glare at Tsarnaev, who did not look at her. Earlier this week, prosecutors showed jurors an image of Tsarnaev taken when he was in a holding cell. It was dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a gesture that Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said showed a young man who was \"unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged.\" On Wednesday, Tsarnaev's lawyer, Miriam Conrad, sought to discredit the use of the image. She suggested the gesture had been presented to the jury out of context. On cross-examination of a deputy U.S. marshal, Conrad showed the jury security footage from which the image was taken. In it, Tsarnaev is seen looking into the camera touching his hair. Moments before, he has two fingers up, forming what Conrad called a \"V sign,\" before raising his middle finger. Gary Olivera, a deputy U.S. Marshal for 14 years, admitted that the camera was encased in a reflective surface and Tsarnaev could have been using it as a mirror. \"A lot of times people do that to get our attention,\" Olivera said. Also Wednesday, Jinyan Zhao told the jury about her niece, Lingzi Lu, a \"beautiful nerd\" and graduate student at Boston University who was killed in the bombing. Lingzi Lu was originally from China but was buried in Boston. \"How she died, and why she died, it just felt like she is part of Boston, part of city,\" her aunt said. \"The thinking is she should just be here.\" The family, Zhao said, put a music box and some books in her casket. Her mother put a bracelet on her wrist and touched her hand. Later, her mother described her beautiful hand. Zhao recalled what Lu's mother said to her: \" 'No matter what I don't want to believe it is her hand.' \" The brother and stepfather of Sean Collier also took the stand Wednesday. Collier was the MIT police officer who was shot in his patrol car, another victim of the Tsarnaev brothers as they tried to evade capture. Sean Collier always wanted to be a cop, said his brother. He was a child who viewed life in terms of right and wrong. Either you did it or you didn't. \"We thought it was typical little boy stuff, but he never grew out of it,\" Andrew Collier told the jury. \"Sean was always the one to spill the beans,\" said Joe Rodgers, 59, who married Collier's mother, Kelly, in 1993. \"He was a cop from an early age.\" On a Thursday night in April 2013, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Officer Sean Collier lay bleeding in his patrol car after being ambushed and shot in the head. His car door was open, and his foot was lodged between the gas and brake pedals. The officer who found Collier testified at trial that he had wounds to the temple, neck and head. He was bleeding out as officers tried to revive him. Collier would become the fourth victim of the Tsarnaev brothers. The night still feels like a dream for Rodgers. \"He had a hole in the middle of his head,\" Rodgers said. \"He was shot to pieces. He was just laying there. My wife was touching him, and his blood was coming up in her hands.\" Prosecution shows what it calls Tsarnaev's defiant message to U.S. Prosecutors said the brothers killed Collier because they wanted his gun. But their efforts to take it were thwarted by a safety holster. Tamerlan, 26, was killed in a chase and gunbattle with police that began with reports of an \"officer down\" at MIT. Less than two weeks after Tsarneav was found guilty on every count, the jury deciding his punishment is hearing about the lasting impact of his deeds. Earlier, MIT Police Chief John DiFava told the jury that he hired Collier, who fit in \"perfectly\" because of his policing style and engaging personality. The MIT police, who are designated as special officers by the Massachusetts State Police, patrol the sprawling campus in Cambridge. \"The atmosphere of the department changed since April 18, 2013,\" he said. \"There is sadness and a sense of loss. I think that it will be there for as long as that generation of officers remains. It was remarkable the amount of support we got from the community, but Sean's death hangs like a weight.\" DiFava has come to question whether he wants to continue on the force. \"Policing is the only thing I've done in my life, and I've always tried to be good at what I do,\" he said. \"I lost one of my own. I have children at home and I've always thought I would have been very, very proud for them to wear the uniform. Now I'm not so sure.\" Rodgers said it took his wife, Kelly, months to gain the strength to climb out of bed after losing her son. Saturday was the second anniversary of the bombing. She cried all weekend. \"She was very strong,\" he said. \"She was a happy person. She was a good mother. Since Sean's death, she's very scared of anything that might happen to any of the other children.\" Kelly became pregnant with Sean after losing a baby that lived for a day or two, Rodgers said. His birth lifted her out of depression. \"He was special,\" he said, adding that Sean is now buried alongside the baby. Rodgers said he still feels beat down two years later. \"There's something missing,\" he said. \"Thanksgiving and Christmas will never be the same.\" Collier's brother Andrew said, \"Even when we're having fun, there's always a cloud over us. I miss Sean. I miss everything about him.\" The prosecution is expected to rest Friday, according to an official with insight into the prosecutor's plans. Poll: 53% say Tsarnaev should face death penalty. Ann O'Neill and Aaron Cooper reported from Boston, Ray Sanchez wrote in New York.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 133 words:\nIt's clear from Hillary Clinton's campaign rollout -- a video announcement/campaign ad/short film that debuted Sunday afternoon -- that she will make women and being a woman central to her outreach. In case you're skeptical, Vox has posted a handy \"by the numbers\" for her campaign video, and there are 38 people besides Clinton in the two-minute ad. Twenty of them are women. There are three separate mentions of motherhood. This is all fine and good (and predictable) if you acknowledge that the proportion of women who vote has exceeded the proportion of men who vote in every presidential election since 1980. And let's not overlook the fact that Clinton is in fact a woman, and that's a fine thing to celebrate. But in reality, she doesn't have to wonder if a woman-centered campaign is the best strategy. She can simply look back to the most recent elections to see that overplaying to one half of the eligible-voting population failed spectacularly all over the country, in red and blue states, when that strategy was employed by both male and female candidates. As I've previously written, the 2014 midterm elections saw the death of a political meme: the \"war on women.\" Granted, that's not because Republicans convinced the country that they were the party of women. But it is noteworthy that Democrats who overtly pandered to women at the expense of real issues (and men) crashed and burned. To wit:. In Colorado, Sen. Mark Udall was nicknamed \"Mark Uterus\" for all the time he spent fear-mongering on women's reproductive issues, only to end up, according to exit polls, eight points ahead among women. His opponent, Cory Gardner, finished 17 points ahead among men. In New York, a Democratic candidate for Congress, Martha Robertson, drew laughs from the audience during a debate for accusing her opponent of engaging in a \"war on women.\" To repeat, she was a woman, a Democrat, in New York. In Louisiana, Sen. Mary Landrieu sought to give her ailing campaign a boost in by part blaming sexism for Democrats' lack of popularity in the South. Not surprisingly, Southerners voted for her opponent, Bill Cassidy. In Texas, where liberal Wendy Davis ran almost entirely on an abortion-rights platform, she accused Republicans of sexism for daring to scrutinize her inaccurate biography. Her opponent, Greg Abbott, won by 20 points, and Davis only ended up with 47% of the women vote. Whether in Texas or Colorado, New York or Louisiana, voters made it clear they cared about more than just reproductive issues and weren't going to be bullied into voting Democratic by false cries of sexism. But while Democrats were screaming about the Republicans' \"war on women,\" few in the media acknowledged that the Democrats' deficit among men was actually greater than the Republicans' deficit among women. Exit polls in 2014 showed that men voted for Republicans over Democrats by a 16-point margin, and women voted for Democrats by only a four-point margin. Regardless of whom Republicans run for president, Hillary Clinton will most likely get the women vote. What she needs are men. So instead of running a woman-centered campaign, she might want to figure out a way to court the other sex.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The 2016 presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton places a significant emphasis on women and being a woman in her outreach, as evidenced by her campaign video which features 20 women out of 38 people. This strategy is based on the fact that women have surpassed men in voter turnout since 1980. However, the 2014 midterm elections demonstrated that overemphasizing one gender at the expense of real issues and the other half of the eligible-voting population can lead to electoral failure. In the 2014 elections, Democratic candidates in Colorado, New York, Louisiana, and Texas suffered losses despite their focus on women's issues. Exit polls showed that men voted for Republicans over Democrats by a larger margin than women voted for Democrats. Therefore, instead of a woman-centered campaign, Clinton might consider reaching out to men to secure their votes.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 181 words:\nRobert Bates, 73, shot and killed a man while playing cops and robbers with real police. Bates was a reserve deputy sheriff, which allowed him to \"work full time jobs in the community and volunteer ... time in a myriad of events such as the Special Olympics and Tulsa State Fair,\" according to the Tulsa County Sheriff Office's website. But Bates wasn't limited to crowd control at sporting events for the disabled. He had taken part in more than 100 operations with the violent crimes task force, according to his lawyer.  On April 2, Bates thought he was going to use a Taser on Eric Harris, who deputies had just tackled after he sold an undercover officer a Lugar pistol and then took off running. But Bates wasn't holding a Taser. He was holding his gun. He fired one shot and killed Harris. From a policing perspective, there wasn't even good reason to use a Taser against Harris. Cops were on scene. Harris wasn't getting the upper hand. He wasn't going anywhere. And despite what Bates would later claim, Harris was not running like a man with a gun. In fact, Harris was running fast and his arms were pumping very much like a man who is not protecting a gun in his waistband. What was Bates, an insurance company CEO, doing there in the first place? It certainly looks like Bates was given special access to \"real\" policing. Harris had given $2,500 to Sheriff Stanley Glanz's re-election campaign. He donated cars to the department. He gave equipment. So it would be noteworthy if Bates ends up being convicted based on evidence provided by \"sunglass cameras\" that he may have purchased for the department. A Tulsa police official said the agency has 130 reserve deputies, many of them wealthy people who make donations to the police. \"That's not unusual at all,\" he told the Tulsa World. Maybe Bates could have been a reserve deputy without donating anything. But I doubt there are many volunteer septuagenarians working with the violent crimes task force. He was too old to be policing the streets. Tulsa police said that Bates had served a year in 1964 as a police officer. Most police departments have mandatory retirement ages. Federal law-enforcement officers, for instance, retire at 57. How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? Police officers generally look with a skeptical eye toward volunteers. For one thing, it makes it tougher to push for a pay raise when people are offering to do your job for free. But departments also know that you get what you pay for. What is the point of background checks, psychological tests and the professional training police undergo if a person can donate a few grand and go out on patrol? Some people are a little too eager to be police officers. These people perhaps buy a police-like car for their personal car. Maybe they put in a police light or two. Some have actually made car stops. Police departments hate cop impersonators (it's illegal, by the way) and try and weed them during the hiring process. You want workers who like the job, but not too much; there's a fine line between passion and fanaticism. That said, there are good volunteer police officers. New York City, for example, has auxiliary police. These officers received more limited training and they help with neighborhood events and other nonenforcement activities. They wear an NYPD uniform but do not carry a gun. Auxiliary police and similar programs reinforce the notion that the police are the public and the public are the police. Volunteers remind us all that policing is a noble public calling, and most police work does not have to be done by overly militarized SWAT officers. An auxiliary program also allows young recruits a way to dip their foot into the police world before taking the plunge. It can be a great benefit to everybody when potential officers discover the job isn't for them before they are locked into a 20-year commitment. What happened in Tulsa County is a disgrace to police professionalism, and the fallout from this disaster may push police departments to end these kinds of programs. That would be a mistake. Police departments should encourage more productive interactions between police and the public. But a line does need to be drawn.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nLondon (CNN)British police investigating a spectacular heist in the heart of London's jewelry district said Friday they knew a burglar alarm went off but didn't respond. Southern Monitoring Alarm Company called the Metropolitan Police Service, also known as Scotland Yard, at 12:21 a.m. April 3 to report that the burglar alarm had been activated at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd., MPS said in a prepared statement. \"The call was recorded and transferred to the police's CAD (computer-aided dispatch) system,\" the statement said. \"A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required. We are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call. This investigation is being carried out locally. \"It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident.\" The theft was so big that police haven't come up with a value for what was stolen. Over the four-day Easter holiday, thieves broke into the vault of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. and might have been able to take as long as four days to rifle through the boxes. A former police official in London has speculated that the loss could run to £200 million, or $300 million, in a remark widely reported by news media. Numerous British news organizations put the value of the loss in the hundreds of thousands of pounds. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the London Metropolitan Police Flying Squad said police were still identifying the owners of ransacked safe deposit boxes and trying to contact them to learn what had been lost. The British tabloid The Daily Mirror claimed Friday to have obtained closed-circuit TV footage that captured the robbery being carried out. The video showed people inside the building dressed like utility workers with their faces covered. They carried large bags, what looked like drill equipment and other tools, then exited with trash bins. Toward the end of the video, a white van can be seen on a street during daytime with individuals loading back their gear and the trash bins. British police told CNN they have not released any video of the heist. When asked about the video published by the Daily Mirror, police said they could not confirm that it was footage from the Hatton Garden robbery and that officers have not seen that particular video. The Daily Mirror published time-stamped images it said showed that the thieves had been -- as was feared -- in the vault for days. The Mirror's time stamps, which CNN has not been able to independently verify, show employees locking up for the weekend at 9:19 p.m. on Thursday. If the footage, and its interpretation by the newspaper are correct, at least six people were involved in the heist. Just four minutes later, the first of the thieves, nicknamed \"Mr. Ginger\" by the newspaper for his red hair, appears in the building holding a black bag. He goes downstairs toward the vault. At 9:27 p.m., a street camera shows a white Ford Transit van pulling up to an alley beside the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit building. Men are seen dragging trash bins down the alley before the van drives away, leaving the men behind. Inside the building, at 9:30p.m., the camera records a thief nicknamed \"The Gent\" for his natty clothing -- though he also wears a hard-hat and a high-visibility jacket labeled \"Gas\" on the back. A minute later, \"Mr. Strong\" appears, wearing a builder's hat and carrying steel supports, which the newspaper speculates could have been used to support the diamond-tipped drill used to smash through the wall of the vault. At 9:36 p.m., Mr. Strong and a thief nicknamed Mr. Montana for the logo on his hooded sweatshirt roll in trash bins, one of which might have contained, according the Mirror, the 77-pound drill that bored through the reinforced seven-foot concrete wall to reach the vault. It is unclear, but the thieves may have spent the night in the basement in or near the vault. At any rate, according to the Daily Mirror, no more activity is seen above ground until Friday morning, shortly before 8:00. The white van returns, is loaded in two minutes, and drives off again. On Saturday evening, Mr. Ginger returns, two days after he was first seen. The newspaper says is wearing latex gloves and carrying a black sack. He goes downstairs toward the vault. Saturday evening also marked the first appearance of the Tall Man, who helped carry some of the loot out of the building. Early Sunday, Mr Ginger, the Tall Man and a robber nicknamed the Old Man are seen to be active. The Tall Man and the Old Man struggle to move a bin before they drag it outside. The Old Man leans on the bin, struggling for breath, and reveals the side of his face to the camera. A white van arrives by the alley and the men start loading equipment on it, including several trash bins. Three men get into the white van and, at 6:44 a.m. they are gone. The heist would not be reported to police for two more days, on Tuesday morning when employees of the company arrived for work. Police said Thursday there was no sign of forced entry. Johnson said the thieves appeared to have gained access to the vault through the shaft of an elevator that is used by several businesses in the building. The thieves disabled the elevator on the second floor of the building -- which would be called the third floor in the United States -- then climbed down the elevator shaft into the basement, he said. Once there, he said, they used a drill to bore through a 6-foot-thick wall and gain access to the vault where the safe deposit boxes were. People with knowledge of the area have speculated that cash and jewels were probably taken. Some jewelry businesses reportedly stored some of their jewels in the boxes rather than leaving it in their stores over the holiday weekend. Johnson said the scene in the vault remained chaotic as police continued their forensic examination. He said the floor was covered with dust and littered with safe deposit boxes and power tools. WATCH: Top five jewelry heists. Johnson called the crime sophisticated and said there were a limited number of people in the United Kingdom capable of pulling it off. He said he had no idea whether the thieves were still in the country. Although there was no sign of forced entry to the building, the detective said, \"whether that involves inside knowledge will form part of the investigation.\" Hatton Garden is a storied area in London and the heart of the city's diamond trade. The area's promotional website says it is home to \"the largest and most concentrated cluster of jewellery retailers in the UK\" and has been for quite some time. \"History tells us that the old City of London had certain streets -- or quarters -- dedicated to specific types of business,\" the website says. \"The Hatton Garden area has been the epicentre of London's jewellery trade since medieval times. \"Today, it maintains its international reputation as the centre of London's diamond trade. It is one of the finest and most renowned jewellery locations in the world.\" How was $4.8 million in gold swiped from a North Carolina highway? The website of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. says the company was founded in 1954 and offers a \"secure and cost-effective solution to store and protect important and irreplaceable personal belongings.\"\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "In the early hours of April 3, 2015, thieves gained access to the vault of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd., located in London's jewelry district, by drilling through a 6-foot-thick wall. The burglar alarm was activated at 12:21 a.m., but the police did not respond due to the call being given a low priority. The value of the stolen items, believed to include cash and jewels, is yet to be determined, with estimates ranging from hundreds of thousands to over £200 million ($300 million). The thieves reportedly spent up to four days in the vault, and at least six individuals were involved in the heist. The Metropolitan Police are investigating why the call was not given a higher priority and are still identifying the owners of the affected safe deposit boxes. The thieves gained access to the vault by disabling the elevator and climbing down the shaft into the basement. Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. was founded in 1954 and is renowned as the center of London's diamond trade.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 190 words:\nAfter deliberating for more than 35 hours over parts of seven days, listening intently to the testimony of more than 130 witnesses and reviewing more than 400 pieces of evidence, the teary-eyed men and women of the jury exchanged embraces. Since late January, their work in the Massachusetts murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez had consumed their lives. It was nothing like \"Law & Order.\" The days were long and tedious. Now it was over. \"It's been an incredibly emotional toll on all of us,\" Lesa Strachan told CNN's Anderson Cooper Thursday in the first nationally televised interview with members of the jury. A day earlier, Strachan, the jury foreperson, announced the first-degree murder conviction in the 2013 shooting death of Hernandez's onetime friend Odin Lloyd. Strachan said she was struck by the viciousness of multiple gunshots. \"You shot him once but you kept going and you shot him six times. There's no need for that and there's no need to use a gun. Period.\" Before the trial, at least one juror -- Rosalie Oliver -- hadn't heard of the 25-year-old defendant who has now gone from a $40 million pro-football contract to a term of life without parole in a maximum-security prison. But Kelly Dorsey watches the Patriots every Sunday during the football season. She said so on her jury questionnaire. \"I knew of him as a football player, not a person,\" she said. It didn't affect her vote to convict, she said. It didn't matter that he was a football player, she said. Nor did it matter whether he actually pulled the trigger in the murder. \"To leave your friend on the ground, knowing that he's not there anymore -- he's either dead or he's going to die -- that's indifference,\" Dorsey said of Hernandez. \"He didn't need to pull the trigger.\" That word -- \"indifference\" -- was used multiple times by members of the jury. Jon Carlson said he was struck by testimony and video evidence that Hernandez and two co-defendants were sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying, drinking smoothies. Hernandez at times left his then-8-month-old daughter with the two men. That indifference \"surprised a lot of us,\" Carlson said. He stressed the fact that Hernandez played football for a living didn't influence the jury's decision. \"It doesn't matter how much money you have or how much money you make. We're all people, and we're all equal, and we all deserve the same fair trial, and that's what we wanted to make sure we gave him,\" Carlson said. Lloyd was seen June 17, 2013, around 2:30 a.m. with Hernandez and Hernandez's friends, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, in a rented silver Nissan Altima. Later that day, a jogger found his body. He had been shot six times, according to prosecutors. Wallace and Ortiz, who were also charged with murder, have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. What's next for Aaron Hernandez? Rosalie Oliver -- the juror who hadn't heard of Hernandez before the trial -- said that, for her, the first shot was enough. \"There was no need for the other five,\" she said. \"One shot for me is cruelty.\" Oliver and other jurors said they were surprised to receive calls from friends congratulating them after the verdict. \"Who won?\" she asked \"Odin Lloyd didn't win. (His mother) didn't bring back her son. Did Mr. Hernandez win? No, because he's going to serve the rest of his life in jail and he's 25 years old. The worst part for me is: How about that little girl that's never going to see her father again?\" What prison life will be like for Aaron Hernandez. Oliver recalled making eye contact with Hernandez at one point during the months-long trial. \"He actually nodded to me one time,\" she said. \"You come in that room every day and you see this person and it's hard to come to that decision at the end because -- like three months with them -- it's almost like they're part of you. And then, all of a sudden now, you've got to make that decision to either put him away or let him go.\" The jurors declined to talk about the dynamics inside the jury room, choosing instead to keep the focus on the evidence presented during trial. They conveyed a sense of gravity about their task. \"You see, you know, 'Law & Order' and all these different TV shows and it's just nothing like that at all. It's just very serious,\" Carlson said. 5 things to know about the jury.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 168 words:\nGiovanni Lo Porto put himself in harm's way to help, heading to Pakistan to work on a much needed reconstruction project following deadly flooding there. His work and his life, as he knew it then, came to a halt on January 19, 2012. That's when, according to Italy's state-run ANSA news agency, four armed men burst into the building where Lo Porto lived and abducted him along with colleague Bernd Muehlenbeck. Two years later, Lo Porto was dead -- killed accidentally by a U.S. drone strike, according to American authorities. The native of the Sicilian city of Palermo died along with a fellow al Qaeda hostage, American Warren Weinstein. That same counterterrorism operation in a border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan killed at least one al Qaeda leader, Ahmed Farouq, who was also a U.S. citizen. His family members, including his four brothers, called him Giancarlo. Lo Porto grew up in Sicily and then studied at London Metropolitan University, getting his undergraduate degree there in Peace and Conflict Studies in 2010, according to the school. A professor there remembers him as \"passionate, friendly (and) open-minded,\" according to an ANSA report. And the university, in a statement, described him as \"a popular student who was committed to helping others.\" \"We are tremendously proud of him and the humanitarian work he did,\" the school said. At the time he was taken captive, Lo Porto worked with the German aid organization Welthungerlife, a 53-year-old group dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty worldwide. Such work means going to places where the need is most -- places like Multan in Pakistan. That community was one of many in Pakistan devastated by major flooding in 2010, which covered about one-fifth of the country and left more than 1,500 people dead. These conditions are all too common in the South Asian nation, as evidenced by flooding one year later that forced upwards of 660,000 into refugee camps and killed more than 430 people, about a quarter of whom were children. \"He told me, 'I'm pleased to have returned to Asia and Pakistan, I love the people, culture and food in this part of the world,' \" said the London Metropolitan University professor. Specifically, Lo Porto was a project manager with Welthungerlife's clean water and sanitation program, working with 8 to 10 fellow international staffers and 100 to 200 locals starting in October 2011, according to Simone Pott, a spokeswoman for the aid group. Pott described Lo Porto as a lively, very positive man who made friends all over the world. Some of those friends in Italy, England and beyond pressed for Lo Porto's release after he was taken captive, urging Italy's government and newspaper editors to get his story out, ANSA reported. The same story said that al Qaeda (after first claiming he was being held) denied abducting Lo Porto, as did the Pakistani Taliban. Muehlenbeck, a German national, was freed last October, at which time he said that he and his colleague had been separated, according to ANSA. But Lo Porto never got the chance to savor freedom again, like his German counterpart. Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said his country's government \"carried out every effort possible to trace and try to return Giovanni to his loved ones.\" \"Unfortunately, the conclusion is now different (than we wanted) because of the tragic and fatal mistake of our American allies, which has been recognized by President Obama,\" Gentiloni said. \"The responsibility of his death and (that) of Warren Weinstein ... is that of the terrorists.\" On Thursday, after the U.S. government reported Lo Porto's death, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi expressed his \"deepest sorrow for the death of an Italian who dedicated his life to the service of others.\" Lo Porto's death left those at his former charity Welthungerlife speechless and confused, Pott said. And then there are his family members like his mother, who ANSA reports became \"another person\" after her son's kidnapping. \"Her only hope was to embrace Giovanni,\" a neighbor said. CNN's Hadia Messia contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 185 words:\nOn May 28, 2014, some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. But they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event. Instead, the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits. Armed soldiers guarded the exits. In the patently unfair, open air trial that followed, 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed. Three were sentenced to death. The public mass sentencing was part a China's \"Strike Hard\" campaign against unrest in Xinjiang, a campaign the government claims was launched to combat \"terrorism\" and \"separatism.\" But it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Today, Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide.  Much of it makes for grim reading. In Pakistan, the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows.  Iran and Iraq executed people for \"terrorism,\" and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes. In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before, governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism. Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates. Jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in December, putting 11 murder convicts to death, with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime.  In Indonesia, authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety \"national emergency.\" Six people have already been executed this year. A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool.  The rise was largely because of developments in Egypt and Nigeria, where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict. The simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both. There is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence, as United Nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed. It is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough. At Amnesty International, we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades. Thankfully, most of the world now appears to agree with us. The numbers speak for themselves. In 1945 when the United Nations was founded, only eight countries had abolished the death penalty. Today, 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice. Last year, we recorded executions in 22 countries, down by almost a half from 20 years ago. Despite the troubling developments we recorded last year, there was still much good news to be found. The number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year, from 778 to 607. This number does not include China, where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together, but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret, the true figure is impossible to determine. Executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Equatorial Guinea, Somalia and Sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter. The Americas continued to be execution-free, apart from the United States. Those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history. They must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment. Fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task, but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment. With determination, I know that we can achieve this goal.\n\noutput:",

As Kenyans mourned those killed last week in one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the nation, citizens used social media to share the victims' stories, hopes and dreams. Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber -- a reference to the number of people, mostly students, killed at Garissa University College on Thursday -- Kenyans tweeted pictures of the victims in happier times. Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the victims. The posts provided heart-wrenching details on the victims, including one about an elderly man whose dreams died with his son. He had reportedly taken a loan to educate him at the university, where he was killed by Al-Shabaab terrorists. The attack in Kenya killed 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel, and was the nation's deadliest since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998. Kenyan churches mourned the dead during Easter services Sunday as armed guards protected the congregations. In emotional services nationwide, churchgoers wept as they paid tribute to the victims of the massacre. The gunmen who attacked the university in the predawn hours separated Muslims from Christians and killed the latter. The extremist group has also killed Muslims in recent attacks. The Interior Ministry has identified one of the attackers killed by security forces as the son of a government official.

Social media users shared heartfelt stories of the victims using the hashtag #147notjustanumber. The dead included 142 students, 3 security officers, and 2 university security personnel, making it the deadliest attack since the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombing. Churches mourned the victims during Easter services, while armed guards protected congregations. Attackers separated Muslims from Christians and killed the latter, with one identified attacker being the son of a local government official.

He had performed most recently in Istanbul on Valentine's Day.

The cancer returned in 2005 and then again in 2014, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu Agency reported. He died Friday in a hospital in Istanbul, five days after his 66th birthday. \"We are in grief over losing Kayahan, who contributed to Turkish music with countless compositions and marked a generation with his songs,\" Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu tweeted. The singer, whose full name was Kayahan Acar, was born in Izmir province, in western Turkey on March 29, 1949. He grew up in Ankara, Turkey's capital, before moving to Istanbul. In 1990, he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, finishing 17th. The following year he released an album titled \"I Made a Vow,\" which catapulted him to prominence. Though he recorded nearly 20 albums, that one would remain his most popular. His final album was released in 2007. Other artists recorded his material throughout his career. Videos available online show a vibrant performer with a thick shock of dark hair as he accompanies himself on guitar and croons in a clear tenor. Kayahan was best known for his love songs.

Slager has been fired and charged with murder in the death of 50-year-old Walter Scott. A bystander's cell phone video, which began after an alleged struggle on the ground between Slager and Scott, shows the five-year police veteran shooting at Scott eight times as Scott runs away. Scott was hit five times. If words were exchanged between the men, they're are not audible on the tape. It's unclear what happened before Scott ran, or why he ran. The officer initially said that he used a Taser on Scott, who, Slager said, tried to take the weapon. Before Slager opens fire, the video shows a dark object falling behind Scott and hitting the ground. It's unclear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when Slager approaches Scott's body, Slager appears to drop a dark object near Scott. Slager is seen in the video handcuffing Scott after the shooting. Witness: I nearly erased shooting video out of fear. Feidin Santana, the witness who recorded the video, said he didn't see Scott grab Slager's Taser. His account contradicts what Slager told dispatchers. In two interviews with NBC, Santana said that he was walking to his job in North Charleston on Saturday morning when he saw Slager chase Scott, who had been pulled over for a broken taillight. Santana told NBC's Lester Holt on Wednesday that he saw the two men struggling on the ground. \"They were down on the (ground) ... before I started recording,\" Santana said. \"I remember the police (officer) had control of the situation. He had control of Scott.\" Santana said he heard the sound of a Taser being used. He believed Scott was trying to get away from it. But Scott never got the Taser or used it on the officer, Santana told NBC. Who was Walter Scott? A North Charleston Police report included brief statements from eight police officers, but not Slager. One officer, identified as Sgt. J. Gann, said in the report he was conducting a separate traffic stop about 9:30 a.m. Saturday when he heard -- apparently via radio -- Slager say he was \"in foot pursuit\" of another motorist. Gann said that while driving to the officer's location, \"Slager advised that he deployed his Taser and (requested) back up units.\" Seconds later, Gann reported, he heard Slager tell a dispatcher, \"Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser.\" Hours after the shooting, The Post and Courier of Charleston quoted a statement from police spokesman Spencer Pryor, who said Slager attempted to use his Taser to stop a fleeing suspect.  The men struggled over the device, with the suspect taking the Taser and attempting to use it against Slager, the newspaper reported. In the police report, another officer, J. Banias, said he was heading to the scene about 10 minutes after the initial call. Slager asked him to \"secure his vehicle at the site of the traffic stop.\" Banias said he spoke to a passenger in the car Scott was driving. \"The passenger was ... detained and placed in the back seat of my vehicle,\" the officer reported. The passenger's identity was not given in the report, but the officer said in the report that the passenger was detained. Scott family spokesman Ryan Julison confirmed to CNN that a man was with Scott and said he is not related to the family. The family declined to provide any more information. A timeline of events. The North Charleston Police Department is not providing additional information, citing an ongoing investigation of Scott's killing by the independent South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. Gann said when he arrived at the shooting scene, an officer identified only as Habersham \"was administering first aid\" to Scott. \"I exited my vehicle and assisted Officer Habersham with first aid and CPR to the driver,\" Gann said in the report. \"We continued to perform first aid and CPR until EMS arrived... When EMS and first responders arrived, EMS took care over providing care to the driver, who was pronounced deceased a short time later.\" Habersham, in his account, did not mention performing CPR. \"I attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and (directing) the best route for EMS and fire to get to the victim faster,\" he said in the report. An officer identified as Sgt. Webb said that he requested an ambulance. Webb said that at 9:41 a.m. he saw Habersham \"administering chest compression to the defendant.\" North Charleston Police Chief  Eddie Driggers was asked at a news conference this week whether CPR was performed on Scott. \"I do not know. I was told that life-saving ... that they tried to save his life,\" Driggers said. North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey added that not every North Charleston police officer is CPR certified.

Fitzhenry, Paddington, Sydney, N.S.W., 1916 July; Alistair Ross, Lismore, July,\" reads a third. They were World War I soldiers, four of almost 2,000, whose writings have recently been found underneath battlefields near Naours, France, about 120 miles north of Paris. Photographer Jeff Gusky, who has been chronicling details of the site, describes the inscriptions -- and the underground city in which they were found -- as \"breathtaking.\" \"This is a treasure trove,\" he said Monday night from his home in East Texas, where he works as an ER doctor. \"Even locally, no one realized what was there.\" Gusky, a National Geographic photographer, has chronicled the area in a portfolio he calls \"The Hidden World of WWI.\" The revelations of the underground city, which extends for miles in some directions, have come to light recently only because of a series of events, Gusky said. The underground city actually dates back centuries but was sealed up in the 18th century. It was rediscovered in the late 19th century. During World War I, soldiers would take refuge in the carved-out rooms and pathways. The front was sometimes mere miles away; the Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest in world history, was fought nearby in 1916. The land was privately owned for many years and generally off-limits to outsiders, said Gusky, but it changed hands in 2013. The rights to operate it were purchased by a consortium of villages that wanted to promote awareness of the area's history, he said. Researching the city is a painstaking task. For one thing, it's dark, so observers generally haven't realized what's in there until they've gone exploring. Moreover, the maze-like extensiveness of the site has made discovery a slow process. \"They go on and on and on. They're so elaborate in some places, there are maps carved into stone so the soldiers wouldn't get lost,\" he said. The graffiti looks like it was written yesterday, he added. Gusky has noted 1,821 names. About 40% are Australian, with most of the others identified as British. Fifty-five are Americans, and 662 have yet to be traced. For Gusky, the graffiti provides a human connection with men who lived a century ago. In many cases, they just wanted to be remembered, he said. \"Someone could be in this place one day and the next fighting at the front,\" he said. Leach, \"merely a private,\" was killed a month later in battle, Gusky observed. \"It could very well have been the last time he recorded his name as a living, breathing human being,\" he said. 7 things you didn't know about the man who started WWI.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "In a French chalk quarry near Naours, about 100-year-old graffiti written by World War I soldiers has been discovered underneath battlefields. The inscriptions, including those of HJ Leach, a private from Australia, and HA Deanate from the 148th Aero Squadron of the USA, were found in an underground city that dates back centuries. Rediscovered in the late 19th century and sealed up in the 18th, the site was reopened in 2013 by a consortium of villages to promote its historical significance. The maze-like city, which extends for miles, was used as a refuge by soldiers during the war, with many leaving their names etched in the walls. Photographer Jeff Gusky, who has chronicled the site, has identified over 1,800 names, about 40% of which are Australian, and 55 of which are American. The graffiti provides a human connection to soldiers who lived a century ago, many of whom were killed shortly after writing their names. Gusky has noted that Leach, a private from Australia, was killed a month after writing his name in the quarry.",

The Force is with the streaming device of your choice, thanks to this week's surprise announcement that the entire \"Star Wars\" saga (so far, anyway) would be released on digital HD at the end of the week. Between this and the release of \"Daredevil,\"  we imagine lots of nerds called in sick on Friday. 2. Mindy Kaling's brother: I faked being black to get into medical school. Actress Mindy Kaling's brother says that he posed as a black man years ago to get into medical school and that the experience opened his eyes to what he calls the hypocrisy of affirmative action. Among those who disapprove of the book he's planning to write about the whole thing: his sister. 3. Farewell, Rosco. \"Dukes of Hazzard\" fans mourned the loss of actor James Best, best known as Hazzard County's hapless sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane, this week. Others who passed on: \"L.A. Law\" actor Richard Dysart and frequent Clint Eastwood co-star Geoffrey Lewis. 4. When Burger met King, it was love. Joel Burger is set to marry Ashley King in July, and when fast food giant Burger King got wind of the nuptials, the couple scored a free wedding. 5. Michelle Obama broke it down (again) The first lady's Let's Move campaign has featured her dancing on more than one occasion, but she brought the (White) House down on Monday with the \"So You Think You Can Dance\" all-stars during the Easter egg roll. 6. \"The Vampire Diaries\" crisis. Not since Zayn Malik announced that he was quitting One Direction has Twitter had such a meltdown: \"Vampire Diaries\" star Nina Dobrev is leaving the CW series. \"Nothing will be the same again,\" one fan tweeted. Other things we loved:. More than 10 million people have seen Anne Hathaway's take on Miley Cyrus' \"Wrecking Ball,\" complete with props, from Spike's hit show \"Lip Sync Battle.\" Go, greased lightning! \"Late Late Show\" host and Tony winner James Corden put on \"Grease\" for Los Angeles drivers waiting in traffic. The cast of the movie \"Suicide Squad,\" including Will Smith and Margot Robbie, assembled for the first time this week in a Twitter photo from director David Ayer. And no worries, future Joker Jared Leto was taking the photo (in an image inspired by classic comic book \"The Killing Joke\").

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nDurham, North Carolina (CNN)President Obama's nomination of Loretta Lynch to become the country's first African-American woman attorney general is a historic pick.  Her confirmation, however, is now taking on new historical relevance as her wait for a confirmation vote by the full Senate drags into its sixth month. The period between the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote to confirm and the full Senate vote -- which in Lynch's case has not been scheduled -- has lasted longer for her than for any attorney general nominee in recent history. By the time the Senate returns from Easter recess on Monday, it'll have been longer than the eight previous nominees for the job -- combined. Lynch, currently the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, cleared the committee February 26 by a vote of 12-8, with Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona joining Democrats in sending the nomination to the full Senate. Obama nominated Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder on November 8, after Holder had announced plans to leave the post weeks earlier. Hundreds of miles from Washington, longtime residents of Durham, North Carolina, were beaming with pride.  Lynch's family moved to the city when she was a child.  Her parents, married for 60 years, still live there.  They watched the announcement on television. \"That was encouraging but I knew then that we had a fight on our hands,\" said Lynch's father, the Rev. Lorenzo Lynch.  \"I've been in politics most of my life. I know that nothing is certain, and I know that nothing is easy.\" Lorenzo Lynch, 82, is a retired Baptist preacher and was active in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.  He ran, unsuccessfully, for mayor of Durham in 1973. For the next round of his daughter's \"fight,\" he traveled to Washington in late January to attend his daughter's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee. \"I heard a lot at that hearing that I've heard since childhood.  That is the presupposition of the mindset,\" Lorenzo Lynch said.  \"The dual system or the dual treatment.\" When asked to provide specific examples, Lorenzo Lynch deferred to the state branch of the NAACP and E. Lavonia Allison, a Durham activist who has known Loretta Lynch since the family moved to Durham. \"I don't want to think about the epidermis, but some people are thinking that way,\" Allison said, suggesting that Lynch's confirmation vote has been delayed because Lynch is African-American. \"When it has taken so long, when it has been so different from any other person who has been nominated ... how else can we interpret that it is so different?\" Allison said. In March, Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-North Carolina, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said, \"I think race certainly can be considered as a major factor in the reason for this delay, but it's also the irrationality of the new Republicans.\" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, evoked imagery of the segregated South in criticism of Republicans, saying Lynch had been \"asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar.\" Durbin was harshly criticized by Arizona's Sen. John McCain. \"I deeply regret that the senator from Illinois chose to come here yesterday and question the integrity and motivation, mine and my Republican colleagues,\" McCain said on the Senate floor.  \"It was offensive and unnecessary, and I think he owes this body, Ms. Lynch and all Americans an apology,\" McCain added. \"I thought he should be commended,\" Lorenzo Lynch said.  \"I think that's a poetic description of what has happened and poetry, like most language, is limited but it does have wings ... to carry a point.\" Giuliani pushes for Lynch confirmation. Senate Republicans adamantly deny the delay in scheduling a vote on Lynch's nomination is because she is African-American. Many point out that Lynch, if confirmed, will be replacing the country's first African-American attorney general who was confirmed by an overwhelming margin. Instead, Republicans and Democrats say the delay is part of an ongoing partisan battle.  For some, it's part of a fight over a human trafficking bill that has stalled in the Senate.  For others, the delay is retaliation for President Obama's 2014 executive actions on immigration. On the eve of Holder's announcement of his plans to leave the Department of Justice, the political number crunchers at FiveThirtyEight.com predicted that whoever the President nominated would \"likely face at least a moderately tough confirmation hearing in the Senate.\" Some of Lynch's supporters across North Carolina have organized to convince the state's two Republican senators to support Lynch's confirmation.  In March, several dozen North Carolina women, led by the NAACP, traveled to Washington to meet with their senators, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis. Reportedly, the meeting lasted nearly an hour and was very cordial. At a news conference at the Washington Press Club, the group blasted the senators for opposing the nomination. \"Senator Burr and Senator Tillis, it is time for you to act like you have some sense.  It's past time.  You have embarrassed the state of North Carolina,\" Allison said after the meeting. For their part, Burr and Tillis released a statement after the meeting: \"While we remain concerned with Ms. Lynch's stated desire to lead the Department of Justice in the same manner as Eric Holder and will not be supporting her nomination, we are grateful that the group came to Washington to talk about this issue and exchange ideas. Weeks later, the NAACP organized protests outside the senators' offices in Raleigh, Charlotte and Wilmington. \"I think there is a much deeper analysis,\" said North Carolina NAACP Branch President Rev. William Barber II.  \"I believe if she had been Clarence Thomas, she would have been confirmed.\" \"Because of her courage, her character and her commitment to the law and to the enforcement of the laws of this land, particularly the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution, and because her consciousness was shaped in the crucible of the civil rights movement -- that is what they fear,\" Barber said. Obama turns up the heat on Loretta Lynch confirmation 'limbo' Lorenzo Lynch says he carried his daughter to several civil rights marches on his shoulders.  He admits that he did not think that much of the recent progress of African-Americans was possible when he was fighting for equal rights. Now, his small living room is filled with stacks of loosely organized newspaper stories about his daughter's nomination and photos of his visit to the White House. Lynch admits that he's never told his only daughter that he's proud of her, although he's sure she knows it.  He plans to change that, soon, regardless of the outcome of her pending nomination.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nHavana, Cuba (CNN)All eyes are going to be on the new kid finally allowed to play and the big kid who for so long wanted nothing to do with him -- Cuba and the United States in the same diplomatic playground. Cuba pulled off a diplomatic coup by marshaling the support of other regional countries to insist on their attendance at the Summit of the Americas. And for the first time since 1962, the U.S. has not blocked Cuba's attempt to join. Now it's time to see how they play and who they play with -- especially Venezuela, which often falls out with Washington for crushing dissent at home and supplying Havana with billions of dollars in oil. Cuba is trying to re-establish itself at the two-day summit in Panama, arriving with more than 100 government officials, diplomats, small business people and artists. But Cuba's attempts to rebrand itself as an open, diverse society stumbled Wednesday when government supporters and anti-Castro supporters brawled in the streets of Panama. Video of the incident showed Cuban government officials exchanging punches and insults with dissidents until Panamanian police in riot gear broke up the melee. With the historic thawing in relations between the U.S. and Cuba, Washington now has urgent business to discuss with Havana. \"We have really big issues with the Cubans that do need to be solved,\" said Ambassador Vicki Huddleston, who served as the chief of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. She added \"The Cubans are typical of their negotiating style. You think it's going to be easy because we have said 'We are going to have good relations with you' and they say, 'That's not exciting for us and it is for you.' So they are hard negotiators as they always have been.\" The forum could provide the opportunity to push forward an agreement to re-establish formal relations and re-open embassies after nearly four months of negotiations. While President Barack Obama is not scheduled to meet Cuban leader Raul Castro, U.S. officials said there will be opportunities for \"interaction\" between the two leaders. The first time the two heads of state met was in 2013 at Nelson Mandela's funeral. Their brief handshake captured the world's attention and lit up social media. Few people then knew that the two countries were secretly involved in negotiations to thaw five decades of deadlocked Cold War-era relations. Obama had said he had hoped a U.S. Embassy would reopen in Havana before the summit, but Cuban officials have said they cannot imagine a full restoration of diplomatic ties until Cuba is removed from the U.S. State Department list of countries that support terrorism. \"It would be difficult to explain that diplomatic relations have been resumed while Cuba has been unjustly listed as a state sponsor of international terrorism,\" said Josefina Vidal, the general director of U.S. affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry and lead negotiator in the talks. Cuba was added to the list in 1982, which includes Syria, Iran and Sudan. The designation carries financial sanctions which Cuban officials say further damages their already ailing economy. The State Department has sent a recommendation to the White House that Cuba be removed, paving the way for the White House to announce its intent to de-list Cuba as early as this week, two administration officials told CNN. Removal from the list \"does not relate to whether or not we agree with everything a country does or whether we agree with its political system, or its foreign policy,\" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday. \"It's a very practical review as to whether or not a government is sponsoring terrorism.\" Rhodes also dialed backed rhetoric on Venezuela, saying the country did not pose a national security threat to the United States, despite a recent declaration to that effect. The designation was meant to allow officials to target seven allegedly corrupt Venezuelan officials, but it ignited a firestorm, particularly in Cuba, which has close ties to Venezuela. Deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was a friend and admirer of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Chavez's successor Nicolas Maduro continues to send Cuba tens of thousands of barrels of oil each day, despite his country's own economic turmoil. In exchange, Cuba sends doctors, military advisers and sports trainers to Venezuela. In Cuba's state-run media, criticism of U.S. policy towards Venezuela has overshadowed the improvement in U.S.-Cuba relations. In March, Fidel Castro published a letter criticizing the U.S.' \"brutal plans towards\" Venezuela and the Cuban government promised \"unconditional aid\" to help defend against American threats. Its remains to be seen how much Cuba will risk its warming relations with the United States to back up ally Venezuela. But apparently there is little doubt among the Cuban people on what their government should do. A poll of 1,200 Cubans released on Wednesday found that 97% of the people surveyed by Miami-based polling firm Bendixen & Amandi on behalf of The Washington Post and Univision Noticias/Fusion supported improved U.S.-Cuban relations.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The Summit of the Americas in Panama marks a significant diplomatic moment as Cuba, previously excluded due to U.S. objections, is now attending with over 100 officials. This is the first time in 53 years that Cuba and the U.S. will be in the same diplomatic space. Tensions may arise between Cuba and the U.S. over issues like Venezuela, where Cuba supports the government despite U.S. concerns over human rights and democracy. A diplomatic coup for Cuba, the summit could lead to the re-establishment of formal relations and embassies after months of negotiations. However, Cuba's removal from the U.S. State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism is a prerequisite for full diplomatic ties. The U.S. has sent a recommendation to the White House for Cuba's removal, which could be announced this week. Despite improving U.S.-Cuban relations, Cuba's state-run media has been critical of U.S. policy towards Venezuela. A poll of 1,200 Cubans found 97% support improved U.S.-Cuban relations.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nLagos, Nigeria (CNN)A day after winning Nigeria's presidency, Muhammadu Buhari told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he plans to aggressively fight corruption that has long plagued Nigeria and go after the root of the nation's unrest. Buhari said he'll \"rapidly give attention\" to curbing violence in the northeast part of Nigeria, where the terrorist group Boko Haram operates. By cooperating with neighboring nations Chad, Cameroon and Niger, he said his administration is confident it will be able to thwart criminals and others contributing to Nigeria's instability. For the first time in Nigeria's history, the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections. Buhari defeated incumbent Goodluck Jonathan by about 2 million votes, according to Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission. The win comes after a long history of military rule, coups and botched attempts at democracy in Africa's most populous nation. In an exclusive live interview from Abuja, Buhari told Amanpour he was not concerned about reconciling the nation after a divisive campaign. He said now that he has been elected he will turn his focus to Boko Haram and \"plug holes\" in the \"corruption infrastructure\" in the country. \"A new day and a new Nigeria are upon us,\" Buhari said after his win Tuesday. \"The victory is yours, and the glory is that of our nation.\" Earlier, Jonathan phoned Buhari to concede defeat. The outgoing president also offered a written statement to his nation. \"I thank all Nigerians once again for the great opportunity I was given to lead this country, and assure you that I will continue to do my best at the helm of national affairs until the end of my tenure,\" Jonathan said. \"I promised the country free and fair elections. I have kept my word.\" Buhari, 72, will be sworn in on May 29. He will take the helm at a critical time, as Nigeria grapples with Boko Haram, serious economic woes and corruption. This isn't Buhari's first time leading Nigeria, but it's his first time in nearly 30 years. A military coup brought Buhari to power in late 1983, closing a brief period of popular rule by Shehu Shagari. But Buhari himself was ousted by another military coup in August 1985. Read more: Who is Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari? His presidential win is the result of his fourth attempt to lead the country since he was ousted 30 years ago. Buhari is a Sunni Muslim from Nigeria's poorer North, while Jonathan comes from a Christian and animist South that is rich with oil. Buhari praised voters for exercising their right peacefully. \"Your vote affirms that you believe Nigeria's future can be better than what it is today,\" he said in his statement. \"You voted for change, and now change has come.\" Buhari campaigned as a born-again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime. He stressed that Nigeria's security needs to be the next government's focus. His campaign was also fiercely anti-corruption. He ran under the slogan of \"new broom,\" and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead-up to the vote. Despite years of democracy, analysts say, corruption has hindered Nigeria from building a stable economy. One of Buhari's biggest challenges will be Boko Haram, which has been terrorizing Nigeria as it tries to institute a strict version of Sharia law in the country. In the past few years, the terror group has bombed churches and mosques, killed hundreds of people and kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls from a boarding school. Even the presidential vote had to be postponed because of the radical militants. The election was originally scheduled for February 14, but was delayed six weeks because the military needed more time to secure areas controlled by Boko Haram. Yet the violence persisted. On Saturday, residents in the northeastern state of Gombe said at least 11 people were killed in attacks at polling stations, apparently by Boko Haram extremists. Jonathan had been criticized for not doing enough to combat Boko Haram. Before the election, African affairs analyst Ayo Johnson said the vote would come down to who could make Nigeria feel safe. \"Many Nigerians will not forget (Buhari) was a military leader during a dictatorship,\" Johnson said. \"Or maybe they will feel that they need a military leader to address fundamental problems such as terrorism.\" Boko Haram isn't the only obstacle facing the new president. The economy is another major issue. Nigeria overtook South Africa last year as the region's largest economy. Nigeria is one of Africa's largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the United States. It also hosts many international oil companies and workers. But many complain that the country's vast wealth from oil exports doesn't trickle down to the average citizen. As many as 70% of Nigerians live below the poverty line, surviving on less than a dollar a day. Christian Purefoy reported from Lagos; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Stephanie Busari, Faith Karimi and Susannah Cullinane contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

The vast majority of the camp's occupants are from the town of Sinjar and fled the ISIS assault there back in August. But not everyone escaped. ISIS took thousands of Yazidis captive. Men faced a choice -- convert to Islam or be shot. But the Islamist militants separated the young women and girls to be sold as sex slaves. In its fourth edition of \"Dabiq,\" the ISIS online magazine, an article titled \"The revival of slavery before the hour,\" outlines the group's twisted justification and guidelines for the enslavement of the Yazidis. \"One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar (infidels) and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of Shariah,\" the article reads. We're told that women who have just given birth or are breastfeeding are considered impure and cannot be taken as sexual slaves -- but Hanan, 19, was neither of those things. \"They separated all of us,\" she says. \"They dragged us away by our hair. They took married women, young ones. The youngest with us was just 10.  We were all crying. \"They said we are going to marry you off, you will forget your family.\" ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK. For the first week, Hanan was held with 50 others, regularly beaten and threatened with torture, and fed just a bowl of rice. The group was then taken to a three story building in Mosul she described as a sex slave warehouse, where hundreds of girls and women were held. \"They would line about 50 of us up at a time, in rows of 10.  They would say don't move, don't cry or we will beat you. The men would come in and describe the kind of girl they wanted and then they would pick and choose as they pleased,\" she recalls. She was eventually chosen, part of a group of 25.  From that group Hanan was separated into a smaller group of seven and taken into a house in a village. 'Treated like cattle': Yazidi women sold, raped, enslaved by ISIS. Two ISIS fighters guarded the door and ordered the girls to clean and bathe themselves. \"They brought in a Yazidi girl who had been with them for two months. She was wearing the black niqab. They said to us we are going to do to you what we did to her,\" Hanan says. \"The girl spoke to us in Kurdish and said they beat me, they cuffed me and raped me.\" Hanan and the others decided they had to try to escape. That night they crawled out the bedroom window. \"The fourth girl jumped out, I was the fifth. I crawled to the wall and was about to jump over it and then I saw their flashlight,\" she tells me. \"They caught the last two girls.\" They ran, and somehow evaded capture.  Four hours later they were out of ISIS territory. \"If I just see someone with a beard I start shaking,\" Hanan says. Now physically free but mentally still captive, Hanan remains tormented -- like so many others, by what she has been through and what those still with ISIS are being forced to endure -- a fate worse than death.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nThe lawyer for Robert Bates, an Oklahoma reserve deputy who fatally shot a man he meant to subdue with a Taser, on Saturday released  documents that he says verify some of Bates' training as a law enforcement officer. The documents show Bates had one Taser training class over a six-and-a-half-year period, took three firearms training classes and qualified 10 times, from 2009 to 2014, to use a handgun. His evaluations say he got along with other officers and related well with the public. \"Robert Bates has met all the requisite training required by Oklahoma to be a reserve deputy,\" said the lawyer, Scott Wood, in an interview with CNN. Read the documents. CNN could not independently confirm the documents were authentic. Wood said he got them from Bates, who asked the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office to provide his training records. The sheriff's office has turned down CNN's requests for the training documents, saying they are part of the investigation. Authorities did not reply Saturday to a request for comment on Wood's statements. The documents are important because Bates' training has become a central issue in the case. The lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that Bates, 73, wasn't qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff. The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were told to forge Bates' records and were reassigned when they refused. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has denied these allegations. The documents provided to CNN cover the period from July 22, 2008, to December 12, 2014. Bates had one Taser training class, on March 4, 2009, according to a document with a heading from The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training, which sets the standards for training peace officers in the state. Wood said the council requires only one hands-on class on use of a Taser. Bates had weapons training once in September 2008 and twice in 2009, according to sheriff's office records that Bates obtained, Wood said. He scored high enough at the pistol range 10 times from September 24, 2009, to April 9, 2014, that he was allowed to carry a handgun while on duty, Wood said. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in the death of Eric Harris. Friends and family of Harris gathered in Tulsa on Saturday afternoon for a visitation and viewing. Bates is free on $25,000 bond. He says he meant to use his Taser on Harris during the April 2 arrest but accidentally fired his handgun instead. \"I shot him! I'm sorry!\" Bates is heard saying on video of the incident. Bates, an insurance company executive, has gone to his own defense. In an interview Friday with the \"Today\" show on NBC, Bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies. \"That is absolutely the truth. I have it in writing,\" he told the show. Questions have already been raised about Bates' training and when his service with the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office started. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he \"became an advanced TCSO Reserve Deputy in 2007.\" Wood said Bates started working for the sheriff's office in late 2007 or 2008. But the sheriff's office has said Bates had been a reserve deputy since 2008. Bates, who worked as a police officer for one year in the 1960s, completed 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience since becoming a reserve deputy, according to the sheriff's office. The Tulsa World said 480 hours of field training are required to be an \"advanced\" reserve deputy, which Bates claimed to be. Questions have been raised about Bates' firearms qualifications scores. To be allowed to carry a pistol on duty, deputies need to score 72 while firing at a silhouette of a man at the firing range, Wood said. Documents with a heading \"Firearms Qualification Record\" show Bates scoring at least 72 on six different days. But firearms qualification records from four dates in 2012 and 2013 are missing for the entire sheriff's office, Wood said. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office says it can't find the records. The department's summary of Bates' weapons training shows he scored 80-84 those four times. \"If you're going to forge somebody's score why not give them a 90 or a 95,\" Wood said. CNN provided the documents to the Tulsa World. Ziva Branstetter, an editor with the newspaper, said the new information doesn't undercut the World's reporting. \"These records back up the validity of our story and we stand by our story,\" she said Saturday. Another seeming oddity of the records is how many classes Bates took on two days. The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training records show Bates took 14 training classes worth 20 credit hours on December 10, 2013, and 20 classes worth 31 credit hours on December 11, 2014. Wood said Bates may have been cramming in his required training before the end of the year by taking computer classes. \"It's possible you could take a half-hour class and if you know the material you could finish it in 15 minutes,\" he said. Evaluations show supervisors had a good opinion of Bates. One from March 14, 2009, says of his strengths: \"Works well with his fellow officers and relates to the public very well.\" His weakness: \"Radio usage/geography.\" Remedial training: \"Does not have a lot of radio usage time which will be worked on. Will have to work on his geography skills. Both will be remedied in time!\"\n\noutput:",

Police arrested the suspect at 11 p.m. Tuesday. \"After developing information that George Davon Kennedy was the third suspect seen in the video of the gang rape, BCSO Investigators obtained a warrant for his arrest,\" according to a news release. Investigators discovered that Kennedy had family in DeKalb County, Georgia, and reached out to the sheriff's office there. Deputies in DeKalb, in the Atlanta area, tracked down Kennedy and arrested him on a charge of sexual assault by multiple perpetrators, the Bay County Sheriff's Office said. Kennedy is from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and has been a student at Middle Tennessee State University, the sheriff's office said. Previously, Ryan Calhoun and Delonte Martistee were arrested and charged with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators, the sheriff's office said. Calhoun was released Saturday after posting $50,000 bond; Martistee remains in Bay County Jail, a county deputy said. Troy University in Alabama said the two are students and have been \"placed on temporary suspension from school per the university's standards of conduct and disciplinary procedures. Martistee, a member of the track and field team, has also been removed from the team.\" Martistee is represented by a public defender. Calhoun's legal representation is unclear. No public statement has been made on either's behalf. The arrests come after a woman told police she may have been drugged and gang-raped on a beach behind a popular club in broad daylight as bystanders watched. The woman didn't recall the assault, police say, but she saw the video of her alleged assault on the news, and though the footage had to be blurred, she recognized her tattoos and contacted authorities. It's not the first time this has happened to a young woman in Panama City Beach, authorities say. Four young men were involved in the assault, Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said, and while he previously said federal marshals were trying to track down a third suspect and investigators were seeking a possible witness, it's unclear if the person arrested Tuesday was someone the police had been looking for. \"There's hundreds, hundreds of people standing there -- watching, looking, seeing, hearing what's going on,\" McKeithen said. \"And yet our culture and our society and our young people have got to the point where obviously this is acceptable somewhere. I will tell you it is not acceptable in Bay County.\" Authorities have said they plan to interview the woman and show her the full video to see whether she knows the attackers and can help identify other suspects, said Ruth Corley, spokeswoman for the sheriff's office. Authorities are pressing charges, and the woman plans to cooperate, Corley said. Investigators were to meet with her this week. After interviewing witnesses, Bay County investigators determined the alleged rape took place between March 10 and March 12, behind Spinnaker Beach Club, a popular bar and dance club for spring breakers. She \"does not remember the assault at all,\" Corley said. \"She remembers taking a drink from a CamelBak and there is a strong possibility she was drugged.\" (CamelBak sells various products for transporting water or other drinks.) She was visiting Panama City Beach at the time of the assault, and is now home, authorities said. The Troy, Alabama, Police Department found the video during the course of an investigation into an unrelated shooting and turned it over to the Bay County Sheriff's Office. The video shows suspects pushing the victim's hand aside and holding her legs down, Corley said. \"You can see in the video there are people two feet away. They were assaulting her, and we believe the people around her knew she was being assaulted.\" The suspects can be heard commenting about what they are doing to her, Corley said. Authorities have three sworn statements from witnesses stating that the assault happened, Corley said. The sheriff's office released part of the video to local TV stations, which blurred portions of it before airing. CNN is showing part of what was released. While the video is \"one of the most disgusting, repulsive, sickening things that I've seen this year on Panama City Beach,\" it's not an isolated incident, McKeithen said. \"This is not the first video we've recovered. It's not the second video. It's not the third video. There's a number of videos we've recovered with things similar to this, and I can only imagine how many things we haven't recovered.\" Corley said that through social media, \"we have been able to find video of girls, incoherent and passed out, and almost like they are drugged, being assaulted on the beaches of Panama City in front of a bunch of people standing around.\" About 100,000 spring break revelers come to the beach community every year. This year, the Bay County Sheriff's Office made more than 1,000 arrests for various crimes -- about triple the number of arrests made in the same period last year. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Josh Levs and Alexandra Field contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nMost airline pilots have an above average ability to compartmentalize personal problems. The cockpit is our \"safe\" place. The flight deck is a structured world of black and white. Checklists. Procedures. Standardization. Stress from the job is an accepted part of our career. However, sometimes during the course of an airline pilot's career, or anyone's career for that matter, stress issues may manifest as depression. Depression is treatable. And for airline pilots, it is no longer debilitating to our livelihood. The Federal Aviation Administration now approves certain prescribed medication, allowing us to continue flying until depression is no longer a factor. As the world learns more about Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot on Germanwings Flight 9525, it is readily apparent that this young man had psychiatric issues far beyond clinical depression. He reportedly was administered a series of injections to mitigate his problems, an absolute reflection on the serious nature of his illness. But Lubitz's illness didn't just appear out of thin air.  Its effects had to be apparent to others. Lubitz's girlfriend made her concerns public knowledge -- unfortunately after events took their course. Considering the hoops Lubitz had to jump through to have established himself as a Germanwings co-pilot, it's curious to me how the red flags of his illness were missed. To what hoops am I referring? First, let's start with his passion for gliders. Glider flying is one of the purest forms of aviation. Although it is mostly an individualistic endeavor, the sport involves teamwork. Interaction among fellow enthusiasts is paramount to both enjoyment and safety. I'm a glider pilot. Participation among the members of my club uncovers the personalities and idiosyncrasies of each pilot. Behaviors not quite conducive to the activity are readily apparent. Second, Lubitz had to compete successfully in a selection process just to have the opportunity to train through Lufthansa's flight program, a requirement of Germanwings employment. The selection process is most likely highly competitive, requiring above-average aptitude. Is the selection process flawed to the extent that a serious mental disorder would go unnoticed? Regardless, the process had to be a stressful experience. Opinion: Germanwings and the stigma of mental illness. Once accepted into the flight program, a rigorous training period began. For primary training, Lufthansa utilizes an ab initio (from the beginning) program based at a facility the airline owns in Goodyear, Arizona, near Phoenix. The training is geared toward a multi-crew pilot license, or MPL, recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The purpose of an MPL is to funnel airline pilot candidates having little or no flight time into the right seat as first officers. Countries that don't have the luxury of selecting from a large pool of experienced pilots use this license. Airline pilots in the United States are not licensed in this manner, requiring as much as 1,500 hours to qualify as a co-pilot. This is a fairly recent change in FAA regulations, initiated as a result of the 2009 Colgan Airlines crash in Buffalo, New York. Lubitz had barely over 600 hours of flight time when he committed his act of horror. As a 21-year-old flight instructor, I had that much flight time; it hardly qualified as a lot of experience. As with all of the MPL programs, the training involves an intense period of airline-specific instruction. And to add insult to injury, candidates are not paid during the training until such time as they pass a final check ride. Regardless, the cost is borne by the student to the tune of about $76,000. Using both actual flight experience in a single-engine airplane and simulator time, the student receives about 250 hours of training. It is a period of almost constant supervision. Aside from observing and checking performance criteria, wouldn't at least one instructor have noticed behavioral issues in such an intense environment? And wouldn't a fellow trainee have noticed also? According to reports, Lubitz took a leave from his training -- a very untypical behavior. Was that not in and of itself a red flag?  Wouldn't a manager in Lufthansa's flight department consider it prudent to reconsider a candidate with an indication of potential issues? After all, the selection process was most likely highly competitive, with other qualified candidates readily available. Once the primary training in Arizona was complete, Lubitz would have returned to Germany and completed more specific schooling on the Airbus A320 he was about to fly. Again, no one observed issues. But even more curious, according to reports, Lubitz disclosed a diagnosis of previous depression to Lufthansa. Over the course of a career, an airline pilot spends thousands of hours sharing the confined space of the cockpit with colleagues. Even if we have never flown with a particular individual, experience allows us the intuition to know when something isn't quite right. That determination can be made through performance observation of typical routines, or perhaps through a simple conversation. In that regard, I find it difficult to believe that none of Lubitz's colleagues made a less than positive assessment at some point in time. As supplemental background, Germanwings had been established as the low-cost, alter ego carrier of Lufthansa. Depending upon a pilot's monthly flight time, salary for pilots can be as much as 20% lower than the mainline carrier. In addition, more days on duty were part of a Germanwings crew member's schedule. Apparently as late as March 20, Lufthansa pilots had been on strike, one of the main disputes being an early retirement option and less desirable working conditions for new hires. Perhaps enough of a disparity existed for Germanwings pilots such that medical leave benefits would not have covered Lubitz's absence. Regardless, all of these factors combined to add a perfect storm of stress to one sick 27-year-old man. The world knows the end result. It just seems to me that this was an accident waiting to happen. Could it have been prevented? Well, this is the primary purpose of accident investigation: Never allow the same tragedy to occur again.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nDuhok, Iraqi Kurdistan (CNN)The children laugh and shriek, as some of them seem to always have the capacity to do no matter how depressing the circumstances. Their bright clothes provide splashes of color against the otherwise drab monotone white of the endless rows of tents. A small group plays with rocks, replacements for the toys they left behind when they fled, while others clamber through a jagged tear in the wire fence surrounding the refugee camp. The Shariya refugee camp opened around six months ago, made up of some 4,000 tents and counting. Thousands of Yazidis now call this corner of Iraqi Kurdistan home, about 18 miles (30 kilometers) from one of the front lines with ISIS, where one can hear the occasional reverberation in the distance of what we are told are airstrikes. The vast majority of the camp's occupants are from the town of Sinjar, which is near the border with Syrian Kurdistan, and fled the ISIS assault there back in August. But not everyone escaped. ISIS took thousands of Yazidis captive. The fighters separated the young women and girls, some as young as 8 years old, to be sold as slaves, for their \"masters\" to use as concubines. Men faced a choice: Convert to Islam or be shot. Mahmoud was out running errands when ISIS fighters arrived, taking his wife, Ahlam, their three children -- the youngest of which was just a month old -- and his elderly parents. \"They took our phones, jewelry, money,\" Ahlam recalls. \"They had guns. They forced us at gunpoint into big trailer trucks.\" They were taken to a school turned prison in Tal Afar. From there, the family was moved from village to village -- and at one stage taken to Mosul. \"They wrote everyone's name down and they asked where we want to work, in the fields, as cleaners or as herders,\" she says. Ahlam and her family chose to herd goats. They were then taken to a Shia village whose residents had fled, where they were part of a group of around 40 living in one house. In the home, Ahlam found a cell phone left behind by its former occupants and called her husband. \"I said we are alive but we are prisoners.\" Ahlam's husband, who up until that moment had lost the will to live, thinking his family was dead, says he cried out of happiness despite his pain. Ahlam would call when she could, briefly, after midnight, hiding under her bedcovers. If she was caught with a phone, she would be killed. The village itself was a massive prison, its entrances guarded by ISIS fighters. She recalls that two men, in their late 40s or 50s, tried to escape. When they were caught, their bones were broken, their bodies tied to the back of a truck and then driven through the streets. The Yazidi captives were forced to watch the gruesome spectacle. The men's corpses were then tossed into a ditch and an order given not to bury them. One night, some of the Yazidi men risked their lives to toss dirt onto the bodies, to give those slain what dignity they could. Ahlam tells us that about a week before we met, ISIS fighters came by and took away her in-laws and the other elderly people living in the house. \"We didn't know where they were taking them, we thought we would be next,\" she remembers. So she and the rest of the group realized that they had to try to flee. \"We decided that either we survive or we don't.\" They left at midnight. Ahlam cradled the baby, as her two other children, ages 3 and 4 years old, clutched at her clothes. She prayed the baby wouldn't cry, that the children could keep walking. They knew the general direction to take, but not the exact route, and they could only hope it was toward freedom. \"When the sun started to come up, I thought that's it, we are going to get caught,\" Ahlam says. \"And what am I going to do with the kids?  I can't carry all three of them and run.\" Luckily, Ahlam never had to answer that impossible question. The group made it into Iraqi Kurdistan. The couple can't put into words their emotions when they were reunited. Mahmoud, gently caressing his daughter's palm, says he could hardly believe that the woman whose stunning eyes and gentle words he had fallen in love with, and their three children, were by his side again. It had been eight agonizing months. But their joy was tainted by fear for Mahmoud's parents. A few days after Mahmoud and Ahlam were reunited, ISIS released 217 captives. No one is disclosing exactly why. Among them were 60 children, a handful of men and women, and the rest were elderly -- including Mahmoud's parents. \"We didn't know if they were going to slaughter us or what they were going to do with us,\" Mahmoud's father says. \"They moved us around a lot, and at one stage we stayed in in one place for three days.\" But Ahlam's parents are still with ISIS. Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi member of Iraq's parliament, speculates that the Yazidis ISIS released are individuals they were struggling to care for. Dakhil is part of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's delegation to the United States this week. She will be addressing the United Nations -- pleading for more international support for Iraq and more airstrikes to help defeat ISIS -- and she will address the plight of the Yazidis. \"We sometimes say that we wish we had been massacred. This would be better than being kidnapped and raped. We prefer death now over the fate of what is happening to these girls and women,\" Dakhil says. \"It is now on the government and on the international community to focus on this. How to get these captives back. It's inconceivable that in the 21st century, something like this is happening as if we were living in the Stone Age.\" Ahlam says she was spared because she was breastfeeding and she had young children, which, we're told, makes her impure and therefore unable to be used as a sex slave. For Ahlam, what she went through was not the hardest part of her ordeal. It's the moment when the ISIS fighters began taking away the girls and young women. She's haunted by their screams, the image of them being dragged away sobbing and screaming.\n\noutput:",

White will wrap his touring efforts in support of \"Lazeretto\" with a brief, first-ever acoustic tour that will hit \"the only five states left in the U.S. that he has yet to play,\" according to White's website. Rounding out the acoustic quartet on tour will be Fats Kaplin, Lillie Mae Rische and Dominic Davis. The shows will be unannounced until day-of-show, with tickets priced at $3 and limited to one ticket per person, to be purchased only at the venue on a first-come, first-served basis. Billboard: Jack White on Not Being a 'Sound-Bite Artist,' Living in the Wrong Era and Why Vinyl Records Are 'Hypnotic' The purposely vague announcement surely has fans (and journalists) scouring the Internet for White's touring history. Unclear is whether White includes his work with The White Stripes, The Raconteurs and Dead Weather in his touring history, or just his solo road work. Presumably, he's including all of his touring, with all bands, as Billboard could find only 29 states in which he has performed as Jack White. Tour dates with White Stripes add another 12 states. That leaves nine states for which we could not find a show for White: Hawaii (where a show is scheduled for tomorrow, April 15), Arkansas, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Vermont, Iowa, and North and South Dakota. Billboard: Jack White Plays The Hits, Declares 'Music Is Sacred' at Coachella. Through the process of elimination (surely he has played Boise, Little Rock, and Salt Lake?), our guess as to which five \"states\" White will play on the brief acoustic run: South and North Dakota, Wyoming, Vermont and ... Puerto Rico? If that's the case, this tour is in for some long jumps, with Puerto Rico to Vermont being a potential beast.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nCatania, Italy (CNN)The boat that sank in the Mediterranean over the weekend with hundreds of migrants on board may have capsized after being touched or swamped by a cargo ship that came to its aid, a U.N. official said. Carlotta Asami, a spokeswoman for the United Nations' refugee agency, made the comments to CNN early Tuesday after she and two of her colleagues had spoken to multiple survivors from the disaster who arrived in Catania, Italy. \"They say that there was a point in which they were very close and probably what happened is that, you know, a big ship creating a big wave -- they were approaching in a very strong manner and they lost balance,\" Asami said. The account she offered differs from that provided by Italian authorities on Sunday. They said that as the cargo ship King Jacob approached late Saturday, migrants on the smaller boat moved to one side, hoping to be saved, and caused the vessel to capsize. Mark Clark -- a communications executive representing OSM Maritime Group, the company that manages the King Jacob -- denied that the cargo ship caused the migrant boat to capsize. He said he also believed that people on the migrant boat rushed to one side, causing many to fall off. The cargo ship was going very slowly as it approached, hardly making any waves, Clark told CNN. It deployed rescue boats, a gangway, nets and life rings, he said. The conflicting accounts of the chaotic events highlight the challenges faced by commercial vessels that are often called upon to help in the escalating migrant boat crisis in the Mediterranean. Asami said the survivors whom she and her colleagues spoke to were \"consistent\" in what they were saying. She said their accounts made it \"credible to think\" that between 800 and 850 people were on board the boat that capsized roughly 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Libya. Previous estimates had put the number of people aboard anywhere between 700 and 950. Italian authorities, who have been coordinating the rescue effort, say only 28 survivors were rescued and 24 bodies have been recovered. The King Jacob, whose crew members are all from the Philippines, saved 22 of the survivors, according to Clark. The cause of the shipwreck is part of Italian authorities' investigation, said Giovanni Salvi, Catania's public prosecutor. Investigators want to study the King Jacob's voyage data recorder and find the wreck of the sunken boat, he told a news conference Monday. The likely toll makes the sinking the deadliest known disaster involving migrants crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa. Many of the victims are feared to be still trapped inside the sunken boat. Asami said the survivors told her and her colleagues that they were all on the highest part of the overcrowded boat, while many people were down in the lowest area. Italian authorities said Sunday that an unidentified Bangladeshi survivor had told them that the smugglers had locked many people inside the lower levels of the vessel. Two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in Sicily on Monday, according to Italian police officer Maria Guia Federico. They were the boat's Tunisian captain and a Syrian crew member, said Salvi, the Catania prosecutor. Italian police identified the two suspects through questioning survivors aboard the coast guard vessel that brought them to Catania, Salvi said, according to Italian media. The sinking appears to be the worst among an intensifying spate of migrant boat disasters in the Mediterranean to which European governments are struggling to respond. Vast numbers of people fleeing violence and poverty have been setting out on the risky journey across the Mediterranean to southern Europe for years, but authorities have reported a sharp increase this month in the numbers in need of rescue. The number of deaths has also skyrocketed. The International Organization for Migration said Monday that more than 1,100 people were estimated to have drowned in the waters between Libya and Italy just in the past week. It reported Monday that three other migrant boats could be in distress in international waters. Shipping companies recently warned that European governments are putting what they say is an unfair burden on their vessels to come to the aid of migrant boats in trouble. \"We believe it is unacceptable that the international community is increasingly relying on merchant ships and seafarers to undertake more and more large-scale rescues, with single ships having to rescue as many 500 people at a time,\" the European Community Shipowners Associations said in a letter to EU leaders last month. \"Commercial ships are not equipped to undertake such large-scale rescues, which also create serious risks to the safety, health and welfare of ships' crews who should not be expected to deal which such situations,\" the letter said. Commercial ships rescued more than 40,000 people in the Mediterranean last year, according to the International Organization for Migration. That's higher than the more than 35,000 people saved by the Italian Coast Guard but lower than the 80,000 rescued by the Italian Navy, which was running a special program, Mare Nostrum, for most of the year. European Union ministers met Monday in Luxembourg and proposed a 10-point plan to help address the crisis. \"We are not yet working on numbers, but what we have agreed on today is, for sure, the need to increase significantly the resources at sea, and the level of the operation, doing more search and rescue and doing it more together,\" said Federica Mogherini, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security police. Mogherini told CNN that the European Union must fight human traffickers, strengthen Europeans' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees. \"We need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people, so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions,\" Mogherini said. \"My pain is that it was a reaction coming too late after so many people died.\" But some groups said European officials were offering too little too late. \"What we needed from EU foreign ministers today was life-saving action, but they dithered,\" said Justin Forsyth, the chief executive of Save The Children. \"With each day we delay we lose more innocent lives and Europe slips further into an immoral abyss,\" Forsyth said in a statement. \"Right now, people desperately seeking a better life are drowning in politics.\" CNN's Karl Penhaul reported from Catania, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Hada Messia, Isa Soares and Atika Shubert contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nRelations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have always been thorny, but rarely has the state of affairs been as venomous as it is today. Tehran and Riyadh each point to the other as the main reason for much of the turmoil in the Middle East. In its most recent incarnation, the Iranian-Saudi conflict by proxy has reached Yemen in a spiral that both sides portray as climatic. For Riyadh and its regional allies, the Saudi military intervention in Yemen -- \"Operation Decisive Storm\" -- is the moment the Sunni Arab nation finally woke up to repel the expansion of Shia-Iranian influence. For Tehran and its regional allies -- including the Houthi movement in Yemen -- Saudi Arabia's actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable. And yet both sides have good reasons to want to stop the Yemeni crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war. When Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was elected in June 2013, he pledged to reach out to Riyadh. He was up front and called Tehran's steep deterioration of relations with the Saudis over the last decade as one of the principal burdens on Iranian foreign policy. From Lebanon and Afghanistan to Pakistan and the Gaza Strip, the Iranian-Saudi rivalry and conflict through proxy has been deep and costly. And yet despite Rouhani's open pledge, profound differences over Syria and Iraq in particular have kept Riyadh and Tehran apart. But if the questions of Syria and Iraq prevented a pause in hostilities, the Saudi military intervention in Yemen since late March has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels. Unlike in Syria and in Iraq, the Saudi military is now directly battling it out with Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen. While Riyadh no doubt exaggerates Tehran's role in the Yemen crisis, its fingerprints are nonetheless evident. \"Iran provides financial support, weapons, training and intelligence to Houthis,\" Gerald Feierstein, a U.S. State Department official and former Yemen ambassador, told a Congressional hearing last week. \"We believe that Iran sees opportunities with the Houthis to expand its influence in Yemen and threaten Saudi and Gulf Arab interests.\" The Iranians find the charges biased and point to the Saudi airstrikes in Yemen as a much bigger case of meddling in a neighbor's affairs. In Iran, the cue came from the country's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been unusually blunt. He tweeted: \"Despite disputes, the Saudis used to display composure [with] us but now inexperienced youngsters have come to power & replaced composure [with] barbarism.\" Three days after Khamenei's speech, Iran suspended religious pilgrimages to Mecca. This came as news broke about two Iranian teenage boys who had reportedly been sexually assaulted by the police while visiting Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, anti-Saudi protests have been staged in a number of Iranian cities. Khamenei's speech opened the floodgate of anti-Saudi statements. The voices of hardline figures in Tehran have been the most agitated. General Ahmad Purdastan, the commander of the Iranian ground forces, taunted the Saudis. \"Beware of the day when firecrackers explode in Riyadh,\" Purdastan said, in a not-so-subtle warning. But it was not only the hawks that came out swinging against the Saudis. Ayatollah Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and arguably Iran's most vocal advocate of better Iranian-Saudi relations. called Riyadh's military intervention a \"strategic mistake\" and urged for a political solution. Seeking a political solution is Iran's stated aim for the Yemeni crisis, but the prospects of such an effort succeeding are slim. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has provided a four-point plan: to get a ceasefire, to encourage the provision of humanitarian aid, to promote political dialogue among warring Yemeni parties, and to achieve the formation of an inclusive government. But the Iranian proposal also asks for an end to Saudi airstrikes. As Zarif put it, \"Iran and Saudi Arabia need to talk, but we cannot talk to determine the future of Yemen.\" The Saudis have thus far ignored the Iranian proposal. Meanwhile, the Houthi leadership has welcomed the plan. As one of its leaders said, \"In Iran's plan, unacceptable solutions do not exist.\" Not only do the Saudis not have any faith in any Iranian-drafted political package that is welcomed by the Houthis, but Riyadh believes that the international disposition favors it. Saudi Arabia was elated by the U.N. Security Council vote on 14 April that condemned the Houthi movement. Only Russia abstained. But a solution to the Yemeni crisis will not come from the U.N. The U.N. can provide a cover for Riyadh's military intervention, but it cannot secure it a military win. This leaves Riyadh with a fundamental question about how far it is willing to take its fight in Yemen. Saudi airstrikes alone will not finish off the Houthi movement and it allies in the Yemeni armed forces. It requires ground troops on a huge scale. Riyadh has tried hard to muster a military coalition that is willing to dispatch ground troops but its effort has so far been nothing short of a fiasco. The Pakistanis most famously turned down the Saudi request and let it be known that Yemen is a quagmire they can do without. Instead, Islamabad has asked Iran to push the Houthis for a political compromise that Riyadh can live with. The Turks were enthusiastic at first about stopping the Houthis -- but in his visit to Tehran last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made it clear that he has prioritized Iranian-Turkish trade relations over rivalry in Yemen, and emphasized a political solution for the Yemeni conflict. The Egyptians and the Jordanians are still supportive of Saudi efforts and claim publicly to be open to the idea of deploying military forces to assist Riyadh in Yemen. But whether they will go through with it is another matter. Egypt has a long list of problems of its own, including a bloody counter-terrorism campaign in Sinai that it cannot afford to lose, but also an eastern border with lawless Libya that is increasingly a new front in Cairo's fight against jihadists. It is hard to see how Egyptian General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi can commit troops to a Yemeni campaign that is not a direct threat to Egypt's security. The same kind of domestic realities, including the threat from ISIS, will also prevent Jordan from any significant contribution to Saudi military efforts in Yemen. These hard realities leave Riyadh with two options. It can look for or even mediate a political solution that will invariably include the same Houthis that Riyadh is attacking today. Alternatively, given the absence of willing states to contribute ground troops, Riyadh will have to contemplate a full-scale invasion of Yemen. That is scenario that is very hard to contemplate. The Iranians too are faced with stark choices. It is beyond Tehran's ability to tame the Yemeni crisis. As tempting as it might be for Tehran to see the Saudis bleed in Yemen, the danger of this conflict further fuelling sectarian tensions in the Middle East will undermine broader regional Iranian interests. A political compromise that both Riyadh and Tehran and their respective Yemeni allies can live with seems to be the only option that is not cataclysmic.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The relationship between Iran and Saudi Arabia has reached a new low point, with each side blaming the other for instability in the Middle East. The latest flashpoint is Yemen, where Saudi Arabia intervened militarily in 2015 to counter the influence of Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. Iran denies direct involvement but provides financial, military, and intelligence support to the Houthis. The conflict has escalated, with both sides accusing each other of meddling in each other's affairs. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has suspended religious pilgrimages to Mecca in response to the crisis, and anti-Saudi protests have taken place in Iranian cities.

The Saudis have ignored the proposal, and the Houthi leadership has welcomed it. The international community, including the U.N.

Two al Qaeda hostages, Warren Weinstein of the United States and Giovanni Lo Porto from Italy, were killed in the same strike, while Gadahn died in another U.S. operation that month. Before that, Farouq was the deputy emir of al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, or AQIS, a branch of the Islamist extremist group that formed in recent years. The branch made its presence known in September 2014, when militants infiltrated Pakistan's navy and tried to hijack one of its ships, according to the SITE Institute, which monitors terror groups. The group's spokesman, Usama Mahmoud, on Twitter compared the Pakistani naval officers involved in the attempted hijacking to Nidal Hasan, SITE reported. Hasan is the U.S. Army psychiatrist sentenced to death for killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas. Osama Mehmood, a spokesman for al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, said that Farouq and another top figure, Qari Abdullah Mansur, were killed in a January 15 drone strike in Pakistan's Shawal Valley.

The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed \"in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014.\" Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. \"As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice,\" he said, according to an ICC news release. \"Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace.\" Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. \"As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly,\" she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. \"Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership,\" said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. \"What's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members.\" In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it \"strongly\" disagreed with the court's decision. \"As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC,\" the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. \"We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace,\" it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as \"Palestine.\" While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would \"conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality.\" The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Kareem Khadder and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nLos Angeles (CNN)It's more than just one state's internal problem. The historic California drought hurts the rest of the union, too. That's because California is a breadbasket to the nation, growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two-thirds of its fruits and nuts. Here's why we should heed the ongoing drought in the most populous state, a slowly expanding natural disaster now in its fourth year that this week prompted Gov. Jerry Brown to announce a mandatory 25% cutback in water consumption in all cities. In 2014, one expert predicted consumers would pay more for some groceries because of the California drought. He was often right, according to statistics gathered by Timothy Richards, agribusiness professor at Arizona State University. Prices rose last year for these items on your kitchen table:. • Berries rose in price by about 80 cents per clamshell to $3.88. • Broccoli by 11 cents per pound to $1.89. • Grapes by 64 cents a pound to $3.06. • Melons by 24 cents a pound to $1.23. • Packaged salad by 23 cents a bag to $2.91. • Peppers by 26 cents a pound to $2.39. Though fruits and vegetable prices fell in February, overall prices are expected to rise this year, because of inflation, U.S. Department of Agriculture economist Annemarie Kuhns said. Fresh fruit prices are projected to rise between 2.5% and 3.5%, and vegetables between 2% and 3%, close to historical average increases, Kuhns said. Whether the California drought will affect food prices again this year is unknown, thanks to a strong dollar. The greenback's strength allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of West Coast rain or other misfortunes elsewhere in the nation, Kuhns said. Moreover, the drop in oil prices also eases the cost of transporting food from California to the other 49 states, she said. What economists don't know yet is whether farmers will plant fewer crops because of the drought. Those decisions are now being made in the field and could boost supermarket prices, she said. \"The drought in California does have the potential to impact the price we pay for fresh fruit and fresh vegetables and dairy and fresh eggs we pay at the counter,\" Kuhns said. \"We are not sure what the exact impact will be.\" The reality is there's a major drought throughout the West and Southwest. While not as bad as California, Texas and Oklahoma are also seeing extreme and exceptional drought -- the two worst categories -- in several parts of their states, the U.S. Drought Monitor said this week. Overall, the Western drought affects more than 52 million people, the monitor says. As a result, consumers paid a whopping extra 12.1% for beef and veal in 2014, the USDA reports. Straining under a drought that began in 2012, ranchers in Texas and Oklahoma last year saw smaller grazing pastures, paid more for feed, and experienced difficulties accessing water to cool their cattle. So the cattlemen began culling their herds, Kuhns said. This year's beef and veal prices should rise only by 6% at most, still higher than the 4.1% historical average, the feds project. But beef prices offer an object lesson about the drought. \"There's other areas being affected,\" Kuhns said. It's called the Golden State for the gold rush of yore, but let's face it: the rest of the nation flocks to California for vacation because of another golden reason. Its year-round sunshine. So the next time you take a holiday in California, you'll find a few changes around here, thanks to the drought. Like asking for a glass of water at a restaurant. You won't find water waiting for you on the table. Eateries now \"can only serve water to customers on request,\" the State Water Resources Control Board declared in March under expanded emergency regulations. Tourists can also expect to hear a lot of requests at hotels about whether they want their linens and towels laundered daily. These requests are mandatory under the new regulations. And they'll see fewer homes running decorative fountains. Because much of the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada has alarmingly disappeared, many ski resorts shut down early this year, including at Lake Tahoe, and some are now building zip lines, mountain bike trails and wedding venues to keep tourists coming, the Sacramento Bee reported. \"If the drought continues through next winter and we do not conserve more, the consequences could be even more catastrophic than they already are,\" State Water Board Chair Felicia Marcus said in March. But what about those yummy California wines, you ask? Guess what. They're only getting better -- because of the drought. Yes, you read that right. The 2014 wine grape harvest was \"third in a string of great vintages this decade,\" the Wine Institute says. \"California vintners and growers across the state are grateful for another excellent vintage, despite an ongoing drought and earthquake that rocked south Napa in late August just as crush was getting underway,\" the institute said in a statement last year. \"A mild winter and spring caused early bud break, although the overall length of the growing season was similar to past years.\" Wine grapes use relatively low water, said institute spokeswoman Gladys Horiuchi. \"Yes, drought years tend to produce terrific quality,\" she added. \"With the record high California wine grape harvests in 2012, 2013 and 2014, there is a good supply of California wine.\" That may be the only thing to toast about this drought.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nA year ago Bloomberg published a story with the following headline: Mike Pence, a Koch Favorite, Mulls 2016 Run for President. The story ticked off items on Pence's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed Koch brothers, as well as other right-wing lobbying groups. Last August the Indiana governor was in Dallas for an Americans for Prosperity event; the group is backed by the conservative Koch brothers, and supported Gov. Pence's tax-slashing budget. Now, Pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians.  Why would Pence ignore the pleas of Indiana's Chamber of Commerce as well as the Republican mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill? Because there's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was Pence's way of shoring up his street cred. It is also the reason why Republican Jeb Bush, Pence's fellow White House hopeful, who is viewed as a little light in that category, was first to rush in to defend Pence and the law. One lesson here: Just because more than 70% of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70% of the country is happy about it. Backlash aside, the fact is Pence has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives. And while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump, the very public debate that now embroils him — and Arkansas Gov.  Asa Hutchinson, and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire Republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped. Pence: 'Was I expecting this kind of backlash? Heavens no.' For there is no way a Republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing LGBT rights, which unfortunately will turn numerous Americans into single-issue voters. I foolishly hoped the issue of LGBT rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election, overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy. Instead it looks like it's going to be dragged down to a replay of Pat Buchanan's \"cultural war\" speech, during which he told the 1992 Republican National Convention: \"We stand with (George H.W. Bush) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women\" and later followed with \"There is a religious war going on in this country. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the Cold War itself. For this war is for the soul of America.\" Progressives may enjoy watching Pence's temporary fall from grace, but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has indicated a federal ban on same-sex marriage is not off the GOP table. And even if you think neither Pence nor Bush nor Cruz will win the nomination, someone has to. In light of that, listen to conservative former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a potential 2016 candidate describing  conservatives' discomfort with same-sex marriage: \"It's like asking someone who's Jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli.\" Or Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal: \"I certainly will support Ted Cruz and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage.\" Or Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has a long history of fighting against same-sex marriage and civil unions. And Ben Carson said jail turns people gay, so there's that. Remember: Pence didn't act alone. He only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials. In fact, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, \"the Indiana RFRA [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate. Numerous other bills specifically single out the LGBT community for unequal treatment.\" Who supports, denounces Indiana law? Gallup Polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay-friendly, but the trend on the state level tells a different story. Perhaps we're witnessing the final gasp of long-ago biases. Or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated. Former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the first member of Congress to marry someone of the same sex while in office, said he believes Republicans want the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage to provide political cover in the GOP primary. \"We're winning,\" he told a crowd in Chicago recently while promoting his latest book. I guess if you look at where the country was on LGBT issues 10 years ago, we definitely are. That's assuming you are part of the \"we\" who believe LGBT people should have the same rights as their heterosexual/cisgender counterparts. But as the situation in Indiana has shown, \"winning\" should not be mistaken for having \"won.\" For it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so-called \"religious freedom\" bills snaking through red-state legislatures. Or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it's raised in a debate or at a campaign stop, especially with Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate. Pence, and to a lesser extent, Jeb Bush, may be toxic now but America has a short attention span. More importantly, they are not alone. Frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets, and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls. If that holds true in 2016, \"winning\" is going to feel very strange.\n\noutput:",

The debate over the law has dragged the entire Republican field further to the right on the issue of LGBT rights, which is not a popular stance with a majority of Americans. Despite the backlash, Pence has gained points among ultraconservatives, but it remains to be seen if it will be enough to secure the nomination.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 155 words:\nAbu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN)Lost luggage after a long flight is a common, frustrating occurrence of modern air travel. And sometimes, airlines lose things that are irreplaceable. American Jennifer Stewart says she was devastated to learn that Etihad Airways lost her most important baggage following a recent trip from Abu Dhabi to New York City: her 2-year-old pet cat, Felix. Stewart said that she and her husband, Joseph Naaman, booked Felix on their Etihad Airways flight from the United Arab Emirates to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on April 1. Shortly after the plane arrived in New York that evening, Felix went missing somewhere on the grounds of Kennedy Airport, according to Etihad Airways. Felix was able to get loose, Stewart said she believes, because the cat's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area. Stewart said a cargo manager called the couple to an office after they landed at Kennedy last week and notified them that their cat's carrier had been crushed. Photographs taken by Stewart showed a large hole in the top of the cat's carrier. At least one of the corners of the case appeared partially collapsed. Nearly one week later, Felix remains missing. \"For them to take a cat and ship him like he was cargo, not a live animal, makes me sick,\" Stewart said.  \"You trust that people care and are doing the job well, and then this happens.\" A representative for Etihad Airways told CNN that that the loss of pets during air travel is \"extremely rare.\"  The airline shipped more than 200 pets last year. Etihad Airways is investigating the incident and is working with ground handlers at the New York airport to help locate the missing cat. The Abu Dhabi-based carrier also said it hired \"third-party specialists\" to help in the hunt for Felix. \"We deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search,\" Etihad Airways told CNN in a statement. \"We will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident, as the safety and care of pets traveling with Etihad Airways is a top priority.\" Stewart and her husband booked the cat's flight as part of their job relocation to the United States after living in Abu Dhabi for more than three years. The couple said they spent $1,200 to ship Felix on the 14-hour flight. \"You pay all of this money, but for what? People assume you pay extra to have your pets taken care of, but they're treated no differently than a free piece of checked luggage,\" Stewart said. It isn't the first time a pet has gone missing at New York's busiest airport. In August 2011, a cat escaped from its carrier before an American Airlines flight from New York to San Francisco. That cat was eventually discovered -- alive -- two months later in a customs room at the airport. But the cat later had to be euthanized because of injuries and malnutrition it suffered while lost. This weekend, Stewart enlisted the help of a local nonprofit, which provided a highly trained detection dog, to help track down Felix's scent. A wildlife biologist who works with the airport has also placed traps to facilitate Felix's safe return, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Officials at Kennedy have offered to assist Etihad Airways as the airline investigates what happened, the Port Authority said. Stewart said the couple will continue to search the airport until they have answers. \"We just want to find Felix. But I just don't know if we will,\" she said.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "In April 2023, American Jennifer Stewart's beloved 2-year-old pet cat, Felix, went missing after a flight from Abu Dhabi to New York City on Etihad Airways. The plastic carrier in which Felix was transported was damaged, allowing him to escape. Etihad Airways notified Stewart and her husband, Joseph Naaman, that their cat's carrier had been crushed upon arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Despite extensive search efforts, Felix remains missing. Etihad Airways, which shipped over 200 pets in 2022, is investigating the incident and collaborating with airport ground handlers and third-party specialists to locate the missing cat. Stewart and her husband, who had relocated to the United States from Abu Dhabi, spent $1,200 to transport Felix on the 14-hour flight. They are continuing their search for him at the airport. The loss of pets during air travel is rare for Etihad Airways. In 2011, a cat went missing at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and was later discovered, but had to be euthanized due to injuries and malnutrition.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nThe arrest and death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore has stoked protests and accusations of police brutality. But it's unclear how Gray, arrested on a weapons charge April 12, suffered a severe spinal cord injury that led to his death seven days later. Here are the big questions surrounding this explosive case:. Gray's arrest. What we know: Gray was arrested on a weapons charge in a high-crime area of Baltimore known for drugs. He \"gave up without the use of force,\" according to  Baltimore Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez. An officer apparently took his Taser out, and was prepared to use it on Gray, but he never deployed it, Rodriguez said, and none of the six officers involved in the arrest describe using force against the 25-year-old. Gray was placed inside a police van and was able to talk, said Rodriguez who described Gray as upset. \"And when Mr. Gray was taken out of that van, he could not talk, and he could not breathe,\" according to Rodriguez. What we don't know: It's unknown what caused the spinal cord injury that led to his death a week after the arrest, and it's also unknown what, if anything, happened inside the van. The knife. What we know: Court documents allege that Baltimore Police Department Officer Garrett Miller arrested Gray after finding a switchblade in his pocket. The Gray family attorney called the allegation a \"sideshow.\" Gray was carrying a \"pocket knife of legal size,\" attorney William Murphy told CNN. Police never saw the knife and chased Gray only after he ran from them, the attorney said. The court documents also say that Gray \"fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence.\" \"The officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket. The defendant was arrested without force or incident,\" the documents say. \"The knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring assisted, one-hand-operated knife.\" Maryland law makes it illegal to \"wear or carry a dangerous weapon of any kind concealed on or about the person,\" including switchblades. What we don't know: It's not clear that simply having a knife is a crime, said Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. \"It is not necessarily probable cause to chase someone. So, we still have questions,\" she said. What can be seen on the released video. What we know: Segments of cell phone video shot from two different positions appear to begin after Gray has been arrested and show officers dragging Gray, who is handcuffed, to a van. He can be heard screaming. \"He was dragged a bit,\" said Rawlings-Blake, \"but then you see him using his legs to get into the van, so he was able-bodied when he was in the van, and we know that when he was finally taken out of the van, he was unresponsive.\" Officers placed more restraints on Gray inside the van, police said, while surveillance video recorded him conscious and talking. That was at 8:54 a.m. At 9:24 a.m., police called an ambulance for Gray. Police say Gray requested medical attention, including an inhaler, and an ambulance later took him to the University of Maryland Medical Center's Shock Trauma Center. What we don't know: It's unknown why Gray screamed, and the video doesn't capture the entire incident, start to end. It's unclear what happened between 8:54 a.m. and 9:24 a.m. Police response. What we know: In the wake of Gray's death, six police officers have been suspended. Their names were released Tuesday, a standard procedure after an \"in-custody death,\" said Baltimore Police Department spokesman Capt. Eric Kowalczyk. It doesn't mean the officers did anything wrong or that they were the only officers involved, he said. They are: Lt. Brian Rice, 41, who joined the department in 1997; Officer Caesar Goodson, 45, who joined in 1999; Sgt. Alicia White, 30, who joined in 2010; Officer William Porter, 25, who joined in 2012; Officer Garrett Miller, 26, who joined in 2012; and Officer Edward Nero, 29, who joined in 2012. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said that authorities plan to conclude their investigation by May 1. Their findings will go to the state's attorney's office, where prosecutors will decide whether charges should be filed. What we don't know: The officers say they didn't use force against Gray, but that's not certain. Gray's past run-ins with authorities. What we know: According to court documents CNN obtained, there were more than 20 criminal court cases in Maryland against Gray, and five of those cases were still active at the time of his death. The cases involve mostly drug-related charges, but there are charges from March for second-degree assault and destruction of property. Gray was due in court on a possession charge on April 24. He had been in and out of prison since 2009 for various drug cases, said Maryland Department of Corrections spokesman Gerard Shields. In February 2009, he was sentenced to four years in prison for two counts of drug possession with intent to deliver. Shields said he could not determine from records what kind of drug was involved. Gray was paroled on June 30, 2011. On April 4, 2012, Gray was arrested for violating parole but he didn't go back to prison, Shields said, reasoning that  whatever Gray allegedly did, it \"was something minor.\" Gray went back to prison again in May 2013 for drug possession and served a month. He was released in June. What we don't know: It's not known whether Gray's criminal past had anything to do with his arrest, or his death. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Stephanie Gallman and Eliott C. McLaughlin, Dana Ford and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

Now, Copenhagen residents can live in a new neighborhood set to emerge on the historic grounds of the famous beer-maker in the heart of Danish capital. The area in question -- aptly named Carlsberg City -- has been home to the famous Carlsberg brewery since 1847, and with it a big slice of Danish cultural history. But the brewery has moved on and the future is moving in. Amidst the district's historic treasure trove of protected architectural buildings will be some 600,000 square meters (6.4 million sq ft) of residential, business, sporting, cultural, and educational space. Prices range from just below Copenhagen's average $5,000 per square meter to about $12,000 -- well below other major European cities. Modeled after intimate medieval towns, Carlsberg City won \"Best Master Plan\" at the World Architecture Festival in 2009. The project has since attracted interest from all over the world. \"Scandinavia has over the past years been attractive to foreign investors,\" said Claus Lonborg, CEO of Copenhagen Capacity, a non-profit with the aim of growing business in the Danish capital. He added that \"given the number of infrastructure and construction developments taking place in the greater Copenhagen area now, we really see an increasing demand and interest.\" While the first apartments in Carlsberg City went up for sale in March, the area has been alive for years. Investors invited temporary renters into old buildings during the construction phase which began shortly after the 2008 financial crisis hit. The area has since been home to skateboarders, bikers, modern dancers, cafes, the national football team for homeless people and a climbing forest. And the head of Carlsberg City says this ploy has more than paid off. \"The temporary activities have been keeping Carlsberg City on the landmap even in planning,\" said Jens Nyhus, CEO of CarlsbergByen (Carlsberg City). \"When the financial crisis started (they) were a way to keep the building occupied and from running down. It kept the city alive and opened up.\" But just because new tenants have moved in doesn't mean it's brewing history will be gone completely. Carlsberg will remain very much inside Carlsberg City, making specialty beer and building a tourist center that is expected to attract half-a-million visitors per-year when it opens in 2017. \"We call it Carlsberg brand and experience center,\" said Thomas Kjelfred, communications consultant at Visit Carlsberg. \"(But) it's not a brand house, it's a brew house. Until six years ago, we brewed 200 million liters a beer (here)\" \"To a Dane, Carlsberg is more than a beer. It is art, it is science, it is culture.\" And soon, it will also be a city.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 172 words:\nA sexual harassment complaint has been filed against New Zealand Prime Minister John Key after a waitress complained about him repeatedly pulling her ponytail at an Auckland cafe. CNN affiliate TVNZ reported that the complaint was filed Thursday morning by Graham McCready, an accountant described in the New Zealand press as a \"serial litigant,\" who has previously launched private prosecutions against Key. McCready's complaint claimed that Key had breached a section of the country's Human Rights Act relating to sexual harassment, TVNZ reported. It reported that he was seeking considerable compensation for the waitress, 26-year-old Amanda Bailey, and \"if she does not want it I ask for the money be given to Women's Refuge.\" Key publicly apologized to Bailey, a waitress at his local cafe, for repeatedly tugging on her ponytail, after she complained about his behavior in a blog post. The post, published on New Zealand political website The Daily Blog, says that the odd behavior began during last year's election season. It was \"hardly an acceptable form of greeting,\" Bailey wrote. She wrote that while she didn't directly make her objections clear verbally, her body language \"screamed 'I don't like that.'\" \"As he approached me, he thought it would be fitting to raise his hands high and make scary, suspense sound effects, like the music from the movie 'Jaws',\" read the post. \"As he towered overhead I slunk down, cringing, whilst (Key's wife) Bronagh told him to 'Leave the poor girl alone.'\" The behavior carried on for a number of months and on several occasions, the post states. Eventually the cafe's manager made it clear to Key that his actions were unwelcome. Key, who regularly visits the Auckland cafe with his wife, told reporters that his behavior was in the context of \"a bit of banter,\" but said that he had apologized when it was clear she had taken offense. The blog post says that the prime minister offered the offended waitress two bottles of his own JK 2012 Pinot Noir wine by way of apology. \"We have lots of fun and games there, there's always lots of practical jokes and things. It's a very warm and friendly relationship,\" he told reporters in Los Angeles en route to ANZAC day commemorations in Gallipoli, Turkey. \"But if you look at it now, no. When I realized she took offense by that I just sort of immediately went back, gave her some wine, apologized and said I was terribly sorry.\" Politicians and public figures also rounded on Key, with Green MP Metiria Turei saying that the prime minister should be held to the same standards of behavior as the rest of the electorate. \"A lot of New Zealanders know what it's like to feel as if you're not taken seriously in a job. As politicians, our job is to make people feel safe at work, not bullied,\" New Zealand media reported her as saying. \"It's a sign of how out of touch John Key has become when he can't even monitor how inappropriate his personal behavior is, and when people are not comfortable with how he is behaving.\" Jackie Blue, head of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, echoed the sentiment. \"It's never OK to touch someone without their permission,\" TVNZ reported her as saying. \"There are no exceptions.\" Political analyst Bryce Edwards told the network that the \"strangeness factor\" of the accusation would haunt Key. \"A lot of people will be laughing at John Key, that's harder to recover from,\" he said in a segment. The National Council of Women of New Zealand, while accepting that Key was joking and did not mean to offend, criticized the premier. \"The fact that our Prime Minister has joined the list of people outed for sexism highlights how much sexism is a part of our culture. And it starts at the top,\" the organization's chief executive Sue McCabe wrote in an open letter. \"Up and down this country, day after day, people are touched without giving their consent. At one end of the scale, it is an unwelcome pull on a ponytail. At the other end, it's our shocking levels of violence against women.\"\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "A waitress, Amanda Bailey, has filed a sexual harassment complaint against New Zealand Prime Minister John Key for repeatedly pulling her ponytail at a cafe in Auckland. The complaint, filed by accountant Graham McCready on behalf of Bailey, alleges that Key breached the country's Human Rights Act. Key publicly apologized for his behavior after Bailey wrote about it in a blog post, stating that it began during the 2014 election season. The waitress, who is 26 years old, described the prime minister's actions as \"hardly an acceptable form of greeting.\" Politicians and public figures have criticized Key for his behavior, with Green MP Metiria Turei calling for him to be held to the same standards as the rest of the electorate. The Equal Employment Opportunities Commission has also weighed in, stating that it's never acceptable to touch someone without their permission. The National Council of Women of New Zealand criticized the premier, stating that his actions highlight the prevalence of sexism in New Zealand culture.",

The first set of female quintuplets in the world since 1969 was born in Houston on April 8, and the parents are blogging about their unique experience. Danielle Busby delivered all five girls at the Woman's Hospital of Texas via C-section at 28 weeks and two days, according to CNN affiliate KPRC. Parents Danielle and Adam and big sister Blayke are now a family of eight. The babies are named Ava Lane, Hazel Grace, Olivia Marie, Parker Kate and Riley Paige. \"We are so thankful and blessed,\" said Danielle Busby, who had intrauterine insemination to get pregnant. \"I honestly give all the credit to my God. I am so thankful for this wonderful hospital and team of people here. They truly all are amazing.\" You can learn all about their journey at their blog, \"It's a Buzz World.\" Early news reports said the Busby girls were the first all-female quintuplets born in the U.S. But a user alerted CNN to news clippings that show quintuplet girls were born in 1959 to Charles and Cecilia Hannan in San Antonio. All of the girls died within 24 hours. Like the Busby family, Sharon and Korey Rademacher were hoping for a second child. When they found out what they were having, they decided to keep it a secret from family and friends. That's why they didn't tell their family the gender of baby No. 2 -- or that Sharon was actually expecting not one but two girls, according to CNN affiliate WEAR. And when everyone arrived at West Florida Hospital in Pensacola, Florida, after Sharon gave birth March 11, they recorded everyone's reactions to meeting twins Mary Ann Grace and Brianna Faith. The video was uploaded to YouTube on Saturday and has been viewed more than 700,000 times. Could you keep it a secret?\n\noutput:",

There are the usual things that are said about it -- the stunning landscape, which includes Mount Everest, and the amazing food. But Nepal has also made some of the most remarkable progress on maternal and child health in the last few years. In fact, I remember a time just last May when I sat with a group of mothers and their tiny babies as they told me how proud they were that they now understood how important it was to make sure they prioritized breastfeeding and nutritious foods. They spoke of the wonderful future they were now expecting for their children, and they shared with me the big dreams that they had. So you can imagine the indescribable sadness I experienced waking up this morning and seeing the news reports that Nepal had been hit by its worst earthquake since 1934, when more than 10,000 people were killed. While casualty accounts following the magnitude-7.8 quake Saturday are still difficult to confirm -- hardly surprising considering that communication lines have been severely disrupted -- estimates we are hearing from the ground are already placing the number lost in the thousands, with the official toll now at around 1,500 expected to keep growing as the hours and days pass. The fact that the epicenter of this quake was so close to the capital of Kathmandu, where the majority of Nepal's citizens reside, makes the situation even more dire. Many of these people live in cramped conditions and have never lived outside the city. As a result, it is unlikely they even have a home village to go to temporarily for shelter. Housing the scores of newly homeless will be a tall order. It is still quite cold at night in Nepal, so getting these people into shelters quickly will be of the utmost importance. Compounding this very serious problem will be the difficulty in ensuring that those affected have access to clean water in the coming days; Nepal already had one of the lowest standards of sanitation in the world before the quake. In fact, even getting food to people will be a logistical nightmare, given that the entire country -- which is about the size of Tennessee -- is served by only two main roads, which have likely been badly damaged, if not destroyed. We have been in situations like this before, and know what to do. But time is not on our side -- we have only a few short weeks before the rainy season begins, which will make an already difficult job close to impossible. With that in mind, we have set up a fund to help address the immediate needs of children, who are always the most vulnerable in an emergency. We and other relief organizations will be doing everything we can to help get Nepal back on its feet without having to wait for more people to die from diseases that will inevitably come from contaminated water and the like. Only the oldest Nepalese will remember the last major earthquake, so the psychological toll for the majority of the country will be a significant and ongoing concerning for us as we and other agencies launch our response. And while we can rebuild Nepal after this tragedy, it will take time and help. I hope that we can all play a role in making sure that the tremendous gains that have been made in this country that I love so dearly will not have been in vain.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 135 words:\nFilm critic Richard Corliss, whose populist passion for all genres of movies illuminated Time magazine's coverage of cinema for 35 years, died Thursday night in New York City. He was 71. Corliss died a week after suffering a major stroke, according to a tribute on Time's website by colleague Richard Zoglin, who called him \"perhaps the magazine's most quoted writer of all time.\" Unlike some critics, Corliss appreciated all kinds of movies -- from the arty drama of Ingmar Bergman to the epic fantasy of \"The Lord of the Rings.\" His all-TIME top 100 movies list, which he compiled with fellow Time critic Richard Schickel, contained everything from \"Pulp Fiction\" to \"Finding Nemo\" to Jackie Chan's \"Drunken Master II.\" \"He savored it all: the good, the bad, the indifferent. Except that he was indifferent to nothing,\" Zoglin wrote. \"To any fan or friend who would ask whether a new movie was 'worth seeing,' Corliss had a stock, succinct reply: 'Everything is worth seeing.' \" But Corliss was not afraid to puncture hype around big movies he found overrated, including \"Titanic\" (\"dead in the water\") and even -- blasphemy! -- \"Star Wars,\" about which he wrote, \"The movie's 'legs' will prove as vulnerable as C-3PO's.\" He also didn't care much for sentimental, uplifting movies that often become mainstream hits and win Oscars. \"There are movies whose feel-good sentiments and slick craft annoy me so deeply that I know they will become box-office successes or top prizewinners,\" he once wrote. \"I call this internal mechanism my Built-In Hit Detector.\" A graceful and prolific writer, Corliss reviewed more than 1,000 movies, penned many Time cover stories and authored four books on film, including \"Mom in the Movies: The Iconic Screen Mothers You Love (and a Few You Love to Hate),\" published just last year. (It was a partnership with Turner Classic Movies, which, like CNN, is owned by Turner Broadcasting.) Some credit him with coining the phrase \"drop-dead gorgeous\" to describe actress Michelle Pfeiffer in a review of her 1985 film, \"Into the Night.\" He also cleverly, and subtly, gave away the big plot spoiler of \"The Crying Game\" by spelling it out with the first letters of each paragraph of his review. Born in Philadelphia, Corliss moved to New York after college and began writing film reviews for a variety of publications before joining Time in 1980. He served as editor of Film Comment, the movie journal of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, for 20 years, was a frequent guest on Charlie Rose's talk show and made annual pilgrimages to film festivals in Cannes, Toronto and Venice. \"It's painful to try to find words, since Richard was such a master of them,\" Time editor Nancy Gibbs wrote in a note Friday to her staffers. \"They were his tools, his toys, to the point that it felt sometimes as though he had to write, like the rest of us breathe and eat and sleep. It's not clear that Richard ever slept, for the sheer expanse of his knowledge and writing defies the normal contours of professional life.\" He is survived by his wife, Mary, a noted film critic in her own right, whom he married in 1969. People we've lost in 2015.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 169 words:\nIt is not hard to imagine the conversations inside the Hillary Clinton camp prelaunch: How do we take the best known woman in the world and make her seem like less of a big shot? How can the people in Iowa and New Hampshire get to know the \"real Hillary,\" the Midwestern Methodist? (As a friend told me, she's someone who \"likes to sing 'God Bless America' on New Year's Eve.\") And how to open the minds of people about someone everyone already has an opinion about? Same questions, no doubt, that the staff asked in 2008 when she ran against the newbie Barack Obama, and same questions they asked when, as first lady, she ran for the Senate in New York. In that race, she ended up spending a lot of all-ears quality time in upstate New York. In this race, she could be spending a lot of all-you-can-eat time at Diners, Drive-ins and Dives — just like the TV show. (Except Guy Fieri would probably have been recognized by the crowd at Chipotle. Just sayin.' ) Dining aside, it's hard -- almost impossible -- to soft-launch a campaign with a superstar politician.  All the gauzy ads and the small classrooms and the coffee shops can't mask the Houdini-like effort Hillary Clinton is making to escape the inescapable reality -- that even her \"Scooby-Doo\" van is followed by throngs of press. (I half imagined an O.J. moment with a helicopter hovering as she made her way down I-80.) Try as she might to launch with a humble start — not entitled to anything — she still is who she is. Virtually unchallenged. Not to mention famous, accomplished and controversial. In watching it all unfold, it's hard to underestimate the task at hand. It's also hard to figure out whether it's actually going to work. Hillary Clinton — and her experienced campaign team — are disciplined and relentlessly on message. That's usually a good thing when you're running a presidential campaign. But when you're sitting at a community college in Iowa and you tick off your rationale for running and your resume — unprompted — it seems less effective and more oddly incongruent. (Especially when the former secretary of state described her tenure in five words — as \"standing up for our country.\" Short shrift, it seems to me.) Maybe it's that the old lessons of message discipline don't work in the informal environment the campaign is trying to create — at least not with this candidate. The hardest combination in politics is that just-right mixture of spontaneity and discipline. The ability to understand exactly what you have to say (over and over) and then say it as if you have never said it before. And look like you're having a great time doing it. We like to call it authenticity, but it's probably not. It's a honed skill that combines connection and gravitas, both of which the voters demand in a president. (A majority of voters -- 53% --  say they want to vote for someone who has been financially successful, as opposed to someone who has not.) So there's this balance: If you're too much like them, you're nothing special to vote for. But if you're too different, you're not relatable. It's a balance that doesn't come easily to Hillary Clinton. But she's not alone. When President George H.W. Bush was running for re-election in 1992, he was facing his own image issues. His populist challengers were calling him insensitive to middle class woes in the struggling state of New Hampshire. Bush tried mightily to drop the presidential persona, did some town halls, and famously declared:  \"Message: I care.\" Some said he actually read it from a cue card, but he also said this: \"I don't know what I have to do to convince people here that I really care about this (the economy). I do.\" He lost. To an empathetic I-feel-your-pain Bill Clinton. And the rest, as they say, is history. Or, in Hillary's case, at least trying to make history.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The article discusses the challenges Hillary Clinton faces in launching her presidential campaign despite being a well-known figure. Her team ponders how to present the \"real Hillary\" to voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, and how to make her seem less entitled and more relatable. Comparisons are drawn to her previous campaigns, including her 2008 bid against Barack Obama and her 2000 Senate run in New York. The article suggests that Clinton's disciplined and on-message approach may not be effective in the informal campaign setting, and that finding the right balance between spontaneity and discipline is a difficult task for her. The article also references George H.W. Bush's failed attempt to connect with voters in 1992 and the importance of authenticity in presidential campaigns.",

From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy. According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea. CNN's Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

It was a call to action: Within hours of the first 7.8 magnitude quake, India began planning a massive cross-border aid mission. With each hour, the scale of the devastation in Nepal became clearer -- some 3,862 people are known to have died so far -- and plans in India, where 72 people were also killed, got bigger. On Sunday alone, India delivered 187 tons of supplies, including 50 tons of water, 22 tons of food and 2 tons of medicine. And there will be more to come. Hundreds of trained disaster relief troops landed in Kathmandu and quickly got to work. With each flight in, there was a flight back out, packed with Indians and other nationals escaping to safety: 2,000 and counting have fled so far. By Monday, India was in full-scale crisis mode: From airports across India, planes flew in loaded with aid, and trucks made the trip by land from India's east, aiming for more remote areas. On the ground: Devastation in Nepal. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a special effort over Nepal. He has visited the country twice in his first year in office. And on Sunday, in his national radio address to the nation, he said Indians needed to \"wipe the tears of every Nepali, hold their hands, and stand with them.\" It all highlights the more proactive role taken by India in recent months. Just weeks ago, India flexed its military muscle to rescue Indians and other nationals from conflict-torn Yemen. Now, it is taking the lead in Nepal. Some might say India's friendship is a signal for the other big country that shares a border with Nepal: China. A display of hard power, perhaps to achieve enduring soft power in the region. But in times like this, help is always welcome. First there's the immediate search and rescue operation, and then the long process of rebuilding work. Nepal will need India's friendship -- as well as China's -- for many long months ahead.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "In response to the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Nepal that killed over 3,800 people, India launched a massive cross-border aid mission, delivering 187 tons of supplies and sending 22 tons of food, 50 tons of water, and 2 tons of medicine. India also deployed hundreds of disaster relief troops and evacuated over 2,000 people. Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged Indians to \"wipe the tears of every Nepali\" and pledged continued support, following India's recent military intervention in Yemen and previous visits to Nepal. China, another neighboring country, is also providing aid, highlighting the importance of international cooperation in times of crisis. The rebuilding process in Nepal is expected to take months.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 195 words:\nKathmandu, Nepal (CNN)The clamor and chaos of the previous day has dissipated by the time we arrive at Kathmandu's only airport. The mad rush of 24 hours previously, in those first confusing, cacophonous hours following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake near the Nepali capital, had died down. Now, families sit, camped out, silent and patiently waiting, but for now abandoned. At the airport, at passport control, we meet a Nepalese man, who is unable to contact his family. They live in a village 20 km from the epicenter. He also has two cousins on Everest, he says. He has no way to reach any of them. Follow the latest coverage of Nepal earthquake. Stepping out of the terminal building, the devastation is apparent. It is an overwhelming introduction to this city that, less than 48 hours ago, was hit by the worst earthquake this country has experienced in 80 years. The death toll has skipped past 3,000 and climbs, inexorably. Taking into account the fact that many rural areas, just as badly affected but isolated and vulnerable, have yet to be evaluated, the human cost is staggering. Across town the bus station is a hive of activity as scores try urgently to leave the city, to make it out to the outlying areas so badly affected by this quake. Communications are down and so many here are desperate to make it out to their stricken families, and discover their fate. The scene is repeated at every gas station; snaking lines of Indian-made Tata cars, and motorcycles, waiting to fill up. People are clambering aboard buses, into cars, trying to get as far away from this devastation as possible. Remaining inside Kathmandu, neighbors stare forlornly at their former homes, now collapsed piles of rubble. We visit a Montessori school, mercifully empty as the children had the Saturday off. A seven-story building behind it, however, was home to a small church, and housed a congregation of between 40 and 50 when tragedy occurred. The pastor's son Nakul Tamang clambers up a ladder, looking for an entrance into the ruined facade, looking to retrieve his father, not knowing if he will find him alive or dead. Rescue teams stop him before he reaches the top. The building is not secure, but Tamang doesn't care. \"It's sad, it's hard,\" he says. Six bodies had already been pulled from the concrete and steel wreckage. A nearby five-story structure has collapsed in on itself. It was pink, with wrought balconies. Now it is pancaked, reduced to a third of its height and a mess of rubble and reinforced steel. One woman has been pulled out of the wreckage, and rescuers continue to work in a precarious hollow scooped out from the fallen bricks. Officials tell the onlookers that there is a chance that survivors may have been protected in a corridor as the building came down around them. A day after the earthquake struck, they found a woman under the rubble. Unhurt; in shock, but alive. It is this hope that keeps Narayan Gurung going: the belief that his wife and 7-year-old are still alive. \"I raced here after the earthquake. I haven't slept for days,\" he says. Workers dig painstakingly, slowly removing piles of stone and debris. They spot someone's hair, but can't yet reach the body or tell if it's male or female. Wherever there is rubble in this city, there is a police or military presence. They are not necessarily commanding the digs but they keep onlookers from getting too close, or directing traffic as best they can. For their part, the onlookers look shell shocked -- there is little outpouring of grief, no sobbing or wailing, but rather a solemn, dazed, collective sense of disbelief. Tundikhel Park was, just two days ago, a vast, open green oasis in the city, but is now a mess of tents. Some have made their own, the army is setting up others. Metal bleacher-style seating has been set up, with dozens of people sitting, waiting, makeshift blue tarp tents pitched underneath. People bring in fresh fruit, and there are water sellers -- although clean bottled water is becoming hard to to find. People queue endlessly for food and water. There is a mobile government field hospital here, and those treated wait listlessly outside, a collection of crushed hands, broken legs, strapped ankles. One little boy was hit by a falling brick. \"I felt something like a fire, and I ran, and then something hurt me a lot.\" he says. \"I am still scared.\" And so is everybody else: those who survived clinging to those they love.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nFor years, Warren Weinstein's family frantically searched for details about his whereabouts and pushed for his release. His wife said she was still searching for answers Thursday after U.S. officials revealed the 73-year-old American aid worker had been accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike targeting al Qaeda. \"We were so hopeful that those in the U.S. and Pakistani governments with the power to take action and secure his release would have done everything possible to do so, and there are no words to do justice to the disappointment and heartbreak we are going through,\" Elaine Weinstein said in a statement. \"We do not yet fully understand all of the facts surrounding Warren's death, but we do understand that the U.S. government will be conducting an independent investigation of the circumstances.\" Gunmen abducted Weinstein in 2011 from his home in Lahore, Parkistan. They posed as neighbors, offered food and then pistol-whipped the American aid worker and tied up his guards, his family said. Just a few months after Weinstein's capture, al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a recording claiming the terror group was holding Weinstein -- and demanding, among other things, that the United States end airstrikes in Pakistan. U.S. officials called for his release but repeatedly said Washington wouldn't bargain with al Qaeda. Weinstein -- a husband, father and grandfather from Rockville, Maryland -- was 73 years old when he was killed, according to a family website detailing information about his case. He worked in Pakistan as a contractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development from 2004 to 2011, the website says. His employer, Virginia-based consulting firm J.E. Austin Associates Inc., described him as a world-renowned development expert. \"Warren spent his entire life working to benefit people across the globe and loved the work that he did to make people's lives better,\" his wife said Thursday. He loved the Pakistani people and their culture, she said, learning to speak Urdu and doing \"everything he could to show his utmost and profound respect for the region.\" As he announced Weinstein's death Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama praised what he said was Weinstein's lifelong dedication to service, first as a Peace Corps volunteer and later as a USAID contractor. Weinstein, Obama said, was someone who \"willingly left the comforts of home to help the people of Pakistan,\" focusing his work on helping families escape poverty to give their children a better life. \"This was a man who basically dedicated his life to service, to people in general, but especially to people in a country where the standard of living was low and difficult. ... It's tragic that he was killed the way he was,\" former U.S. Ambassador Dan Simpson said. Simpson met Weinstein in 1968 when they were both working in Burundi -- Simpson as a diplomat and Weinstein as a scholar researching several books. Weinstein \"was a very kind person,\" Simpson said, \"and someone who was very sensitive to the needs of the people who he worked with.\" Another hostage was also killed in the January operation, Italian aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto. U.S. officials knew they were targeting an al Qaeda compound in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region in the January counterterrorism operation, Obama said, but they didn't know that the hostages were also there. Both Lo Porto and Weinstein were people who \"believed passionately\" that they could make a difference, Obama said. \"There could be no starker contrast between these two selfless men and their al Qaeda captors,\" Obama said Thursday. \"Warren's work benefited people across faiths. Meanwhile, al Qaeda boasted to the world that it held Warren citing his Jewish faith.\" Weinstein's health had been deteriorating, Obama said. Last year daughter Alisa Weinstein told CNN her father suffered from a heart condition and severe asthma. But it was still an optimistic time for the family. That month captors released U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, and that buoyed hopes from Weinstein's family that he could also be freed. \"They have shown with this exchange that they can get this done. If they want to, they can do this,\" Alisa Weinstein said at the time. \"So I know that they can do it for us and they can do it for others.\" But a prisoner swap never happened for Weinstein, even though his family pushed for one. Al Qaeda released a video of Weinstein on Christmas 2013. He appeared gaunt and said he was suffering. \"Needless to say, I've been suffering deep anxiety every part of every day, not knowing what is happening to my family and not knowing how they are and because I am not with them,\" Weinstein said in the video. At the time, a former colleague and friend said his appearance in the video was jarring. \"Quite honestly, I didn't recognize him in the picture,\" Laurie Wiseberg told CNN. \"He has changed so dramatically from the person he used to be in terms of appearance and I would hope something could be done so he has a chance to be reunited with his family, his wife, his children and grandchildren, and not have to die in a foreign country far away from those he loves.\" At the time, The Washington Post also reported that it had received a letter from Weinstein. The letter, which was also posted on the website of the SITE Intelligence group, described his background doing human rights work. The letter said that before becoming a consultant in 2003, Weinstein had worked as a college professor at the State University of New York - Oswego, as a Peace Corps country director in Togo and Ivory Coast and for USAID and the World Bank. \"I hope that the media can mount a campaign to get the American government to actively pursue my release and to make sure that I am not forgotten and just become another statistic,\" the letter said. \"Given my age and my health I don't have time on my side.\" Weinstein's wife's statement on Thursday thanked some but also blasted the governments of the United States and Pakistan for not doing more to help her husband. While Maryland members of Congress -- Rep. John Delaney, Sen. Barbara Mikulski and Sen. Ben Cardin -- and members of the FBI were \"relentless\" in efforts to free her husband, she said others in the U.S. government were \"inconsistent and disappointing over the course of 3½ years.\" \"We hope that my husband's death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the U.S. government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families,\" she said. Pakistani government and military officials also should have done more, she said. \"Warren's safe return should have been a priority for them based on his contributions to their country, but they failed to take action earlier in his captivity when opportunity presented itself, instead treating Warren's captivity as more of an annoyance than a priority,\" she said. \"I hope the nature of our future relationship with Pakistan is reflective of how they prioritize situations such as these.\" But ultimately, she said her husband's captors are the ones responsible for his death. \"I can assure you that he would still be alive and well if they had allowed him to return home after his time abroad working to help the people of Pakistan,\" she said. \"The cowardly actions of those who took Warren captive and ultimately to the place and time of his death are not in keeping with Islam and they will have to face their God to answer for their actions.\" Opinion: Could Weinstein have been saved? CNN's Elise Labott, Jim Sciutto and Pamela Brown contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "Warren Weinstein, a 73-year-old American aid worker held captive by al Qaeda since 2011, was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike on January 15, 2015. Weinstein was abducted from his home in Lahore, Pakistan, by gunmen posing as neighbors. Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri claimed responsibility for his capture and demanded an end to U.S. airstrikes in Pakistan. Weinstein's family and U.S. officials called for his release, but no deal was made. Weinstein, a husband, father, and grandfather from Rockville, Maryland, worked for the U.S. Agency for International Development from 2004 to 2011 and was described as a world-renowned development expert. His employer, J.E. Austin Associates Inc., praised his dedication to service. Weinstein's health had been deteriorating, and his family had hoped for a prisoner swap after the release of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in May 2014. However, no deal was reached, and Weinstein was killed in the drone strike, along with an Italian aid worker, Giovanni Lo Porto. U.S. President Barack Obama praised Weinstein's lif",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nPlease, not even a demonstration. Freddie Gray's family had asked there be quiet on Baltimore's streets the day they laid him to rest. And above all, no violence. Raging hordes turned a deaf ear to that on Monday. But a handful of people repeated the family's message. They became criers in the desert against countless young people flinging rocks at police, breaking windows, looting and setting fires. The peacemakers -- clergy, Gray's family and brave residents -- placed themselves in the rioters' way. Their message was the same. \"I want them all to go back home,\" said Rev. Jamal Bryant. \"It's disrespect to the family. The family was very clear -- we've been saying it all along -- today there was absolutely no protest, no demonstration,\" he said. But the messengers were a finger in a dam that quickly crumbled, as rowdy groups swelled into a full urban riot. It overshadowed the message peaceful protesters delivered on prior days -- justice for Gray. The 25-year-old African-American man died from spinal injuries after being arrested earlier this month. The early fits of violence came in the afternoon, about the time mourners left Gray's memorial services blocks away, Rev. Bryant said. They bumped right into it. \"For us to come out of the burial and walk into this is absolutely inexcusable,\" he said. He did not want to see it spread to downtown Baltimore, where some rioters said it would, and organized people to stand in the way. \"We have a line of gentlemen from the Nation of Islam to build a human wall, as well as men from the Christian church making that human wall,\" he said. But as crowds turned into multitudes, the intervention became a drop in the bucket by compare, and police lines were also no match. As officers in riot gear receded, flames engulfed cars and stores and roared out of apartment buildings into the night sky. A senior living facility under construction by a Baptist church burned to the ground. The blazes stretched the fire departments' resources, as at least 30 trucks deployed. Looters streamed into a CVS, bodegas and liquor stores and walked out with what they could carry. A young man in a blue sweatshirt tried to talk people down by himself. He walked up to CNN correspondent Miguel Martinez, as a store nearby was being looted. It later went up in flames. The man, who didn't say his name, was disgusted at what was happening in his neighborhood and disappointed in the police response to rioting. There was a line of police down the street, not far away. \"They could have moved down here to stop it,\" he told Martinez. The Gray family's lawyers, again, put the family's wish out to the public that there be no protests that day, let alone violence. It's marring the cause and hope for change that may have come out of the investigation into Freddie Gray's death, said family attorney Mary Koch. \"That's just disintegrated into just looking at Baltimore city and thinking that the city is the city of violence,\" she said. Against all odds, a handful of individuals kept trying to stop it. A tall, adult man walked up to a young man who was confronting riot police. He slung an arm over his shoulder, turned him back around in the other direction and marched him away from police lines. But as they strolled past a crowd, a young man behind them hurled a stone at police, putting his whole body into the throw. At least one young man paid the price for his participation, when his mother turned up to spank him home. Before running cameras, she slapped him in the head again and again, driving him away from the crowd, as she cursed. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts later thanked her. \"I wish I had more parents that took charge of their kids out there tonight,\" he said. After night fell, giving way to a 10 p.m. curfew for juveniles, Robert Valentine stood alone with his back to a line of police in riot gear. He shooed away young people tempted to approach them. \"Go! Step your --ss away!\" \"I'm just a soldier,\" said Valentine. He told CNN's Joe Johns that he was a veteran of the Vietnam War. Young people had no business on the streets, he said. \"They need to be in their home units studying and doing something with their lives.\" Even Baltimore members of the Crips and Bloods, two street gangs renowned for drug dealing and extensive violent crime -- and for killing each other -- came together with others who condemned the rage that swept through their neighborhoods. \"The guys who pulled me aside are self-identifying as Crips and say they don't approve of whats happening. 'This is our community,'\" wrote Baltimore Sun reporter Justin Fenton on his confirmed Twitter account. Gangs members joined community leaders and Gray's family for a press conference Monday night on the stage at New Shiloh Baptist Church, which had held Gray's funeral. An announcer thanked them for coming to the church. The gangs have signed a peace deal and are uniting to push against police lines in protests, according to a report by the Daily Beast. Rev. Bryant also mentioned their peace treaty. But police say the gangs' purpose goes much further -- that they and another gang called the Black Guerilla Family plan to 'take out' law enforcement officers, police said. \"This is a credible threat.\" The gangs are consistently pursued by the FBI. At the end of the day, Gray's family had the last word on the violence at the press conference. It wasn't good. \"To see that it turned into all this violence and destruction, I am appalled,\" said Richard Shipley, Gray's stepfather. \"I want y'all to get justice for my son, but don't do it like this here,\" said Gray's mother Gloria Darden, who wore a T-shirt with her son's photo. \"I don't think that's for Freddie,\" his twin sister Fredericka Gray said. \"I think the violence is wrong.\" After their comments, Gray family lawyer William H. Murphy took the microphone. Violence is not the path to change, he said. Then he got back to the message than had been bitterly marred by the rioting. Murphy asked for a show of hands in the church audience of people who had experienced police brutality or personally knew someone who did. All but a few hands went up.\n\noutput:",

A small group of peacemakers, including clergy and family members, tried to prevent the violence but were outnumbered. Rev.

The unrest began shortly after Gray's memorial services ended, with young people throwing rocks at police, breaking windows, and setting fires.

Park heard about the resignation and called it \"regrettable,\" according to the South Korean presidential office. Calls for Lee to resign began after South Korean tycoon Sung Woan-jong was found hanging from a tree in Seoul in an apparent suicide on April 9. Sung, who was under investigation for fraud and bribery, left a note listing names and amounts of cash given to top officials, including those who work for the President. Lee and seven other politicians with links to the South Korean President are under investigation. A special prosecutor's team has been established to investigate the case. Lee had adamantly denied the allegations as the scandal escalated: \"If there are any evidence, I will give out my life. As a Prime Minister, I will accept Prosecutor Office's investigation first.\" Park has said that she is taking the accusations very seriously.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nShortly after being elected chief prosecutor, Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said prosecutors in the hardscrabble town had the \"toughest job in America.\" Mosby, who took over her first elected post in January, now faces what is likely to be the toughest case of her nascent career -- deciding whether criminal charges should be filed against Baltimore police officers in the controversial death of Freddie Gray. Gray, 25, died in police custody from a fatal spinal cord injury, one week after he was arrested. Six officers involved in his arrest have been suspended with pay pending an investigation. Mosby, 35, who comes from a long line of police officers, including her grandfather, four uncles and her mother, assumes a key role in the latest case to draw national attention to the issue of relations between police officers and the communities they are sworn to serve. \"My grandfather was one of the first African-American police officers in Massachusetts and one of the things he instilled on us is the importance of public service,\" Mosby said in a campaign video. Freddie Gray's mysterious death has turned the largely black city near the nation's capital into a tinderbox where mostly peaceful demonstrations on Monday erupted in pockets of looting and rioting in the hours after Gray's funeral. A 10 p.m. citywide curfew was put into effect two days ago, and National Guard troops have joined Baltimore police in an attempt to maintain order. On Thursday, as police handed their investigative files over to the state attorney's officer a day earlier than planned, supporters of the former insurance company lawyer expressed confidence in Mosby's ability to handle the volatile case. \"We're enthusiastic about the new prosecutor,\" said William \"Billy\" Murphy Jr., a former Baltimore judge who is now the lead attorney for Gray's family. \"She comes to the office with a belief in the integrity of these kinds of investigations. We have much more confidence in her than we have in the police because there's never been any level of confidence, nor should there be, in the police investigating themselves.\" Mosby confirmed in a statement Thursday that she had received the police's investigative report. She said that while police have regularly briefed her office on their findings, her team has been conducting its own independent probe into the April 19 death. 45 CVS workers still getting paid after riots shut down stores. \"While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings, but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified,\" Mosby said. \"We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.\" Mosby is married to Baltimore City Councilman Nick Mosby, who represents areas of West Baltimore where riots erupted earlier this week. The couple have two young daughters. \"She's my wife,\" Nick Mosby told CNN on Thursday. \"She's a strong woman. She was built for this ...  I was at church service the other day and they were talking about being at the right place with the right person at the right time. I know her heart has always been convicted to ensure that justice will be served fairly and equally across the board.\" During her campaign, Mosby spoke about the broad daylight shooting death of her 17-year-old cousin on her front doorstep. \"I learned very early on that the criminal justice system isn't just the police, the judges and the state's attorney,\" she said. \"It's much more than that. I believe that we are the justice system. We, the members of the community, are the justice system because we are the victims of crimes.\" Mosby said her cousin's 1994 murder was her first introduction to the criminal justice system. \"Having to go to court and deal with prosecutors,\" she said. \"Having to go to court and see my neighbor who had the courage and audacity to cooperate with the police ... to testify in court and the way the district attorney's office treated my family is something that inspired me.\" Mosby, who grew up in Boston, is the youngest chief prosecutor of any major city in the United States, according to the state's attorney's website. At the age of 6, Mosby was accepted in a school desegregation program in Massachusetts. She later participated in a study of the civil rights movement. \"After having that awesome experience I knew I wanted to be an attorney,\" she said during her campaign. A. Dwight Pettit, a civil rights attorney and Mosby supporter, said he believes she will \"deliver on doing it right, and getting it right. I'm confident in that.\" \"She's very dedicated and part of what she campaigned on was bringing integrity to the office, and so I believe that she will move in a methodical way,\" he said. \"And I think that she will follow where the evidence leads. I do not think she will follow just public opinion.\" When she was sworn in as chief prosecutor earlier this year, Mosby brought up the lack of trust between the community and police. \"Our time to repair that trust, to come together collectively as a community to start to break down the barriers to progress in our communities is now,\" she said. Mosby added, \"As a black woman who understands just how much the criminal justice system disproportionately affects communities of color, I will seek justice on your behalf.\" Mosby is African-American, as are Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts and other leading Baltimore officials. Although about 63% of Baltimore's population is black, they face stunning disparities when it comes to income, employment, poverty, housing, incarceration and overall health. The people on Mosby's transition team included former Mayor Kurt Schmoke, former congressman and NAACP president Kweisi Mfume and Murphy, who is now representing Gray's family. Schmoke, a former state's attorney and Baltimore's first African-American mayor, said Mosby's background will buy her time with a tense community anxious for justice. \"I actually think that the level of patience will actually increase primarily because the state's attorney, Marilyn Mosby, was recently elected,\" he said. \"She has a level of credibility with the community that will allow for that patience. I can't say how long, but I do think that people will give her a little bit more time to do it right rather than to do it fast.\" Mosby defeated Gregg Bernstein as state's attorney in a 2014 election. \"Baltimore prosecutors get to see it all in court -- we've got the toughest job in America,\" she said in a statement after the election. Mary Koch, another attorney for Gray's family, said the new chief prosecutor has her work cut out for her. \"The family wants the truth and they want it to be arrived at very carefully and that's not going to be an easy job for Ms. Mosby,\" said Koch, adding: \"That's her job. That's the job she took on.\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 157 words:\nAtlanta (CNN)A judge, declaring he wasn't \"comfortable\" with seven-year prison terms given earlier to three educators in the Atlanta Public Schools cheating scandal, on Thursday reduced their sentences to three years in prison. \"I'm not comfortable with it,\" Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jerry Baxter said of the sentences he handed down to the three defendants April 14. \"When a judge goes home and he keeps thinking over and over that something's wrong, something is usually wrong.\" Tamara Cotman, Sharon Davis-Williams and Michael Pitts also were ordered Thursday to serve seven years on probation, pay $10,000 fines and work 2,000 hours in community service. Baxter had come under fire from some community leaders for giving prison sentences to eight teachers and administrators who stood trial and were convicted of racketeering. They'd been accused of taking part in an effort to raise tests scores at struggling schools by erasing wrong answers and putting in correct answers. Outside of court, Benjamin Davis, the lawyer for Cotman, questioned the judge's rationale in handing down heavy sentences a few weeks ago. \"I had never seen a judge conduct himself in that way,\" he said. \"What was going on with Judge Baxter?\" Davis-Williams said she was pleased judge Baxter changed his mind. Her attorney, Teresa Mann, added, \"We are happy. We are elated that judge Baxter took the opportunity to reflect.\" Cotman, Davis-Williams and Pitts, all school reform team executive directors, got the harshest sentences during an April 14 hearing: Seven years in prison, 13 years of probation and $25,000 fines. Baxter said of his change of mind: \"I'm going to put myself out to pasture in the not-too-distant future and I want to be out in the pasture without any regrets.\" During the earlier sentencing hearing, Baxter was frustrated when defendants didn't admit their guilt. \"Everybody knew cheating was going on and your client promoted it,\" Baxter said to an attorney representing Davis-Williams. At one point he said, \"These stories are incredible. These kids can't read.\" At a press conference held April 17, most of the convicted educators insisted they were innocent. \"I didn't cheat. I'm not a racketeer,\" said Diane Buckner-Webb, a former elementary teacher. All defendants sentenced to prison have appealed and are out on bond. The lower prison sentences given to other defendants -- ranging from one to two years -- have not been reduced. Prosecutors said the cheating is believed to date back to 2001, when scores on statewide aptitude tests improved greatly, according to a 2013 indictment. The indictment also states that for at least four years, between 2005 and 2009, test answers were altered, fabricated or falsely certified. Michael Bowers, a former Georgia attorney general who investigated the cheating scandal, said in 2013 that there were \"cheating parties,\" erasures in and out of classrooms, and teachers were told to make changes to student answers on tests. Bowers said he heard that educators cheated out of pride, to earn bonuses, to enhance their careers or to keep their jobs. Of 35 Atlanta educators indicted in 2013, more than 20 took a plea deal. Twelve educators went on trial six months ago, with 11 convicted and one acquitted on April 1. Of the 11 convicted, two took a deal in which they admitted guilt, waived their right to appeal and received much lighter sentences. One defendant was giving birth during the sentencing phase not been sentenced. On Thursday, Baxter urged the defendants to engage in community service while they're appealing. He said that might lighten the punishment if the convictions are upheld. The judge said he was tired of dealing with the Atlanta Public Schools cheating scandal, which he referred to as \"this mess.\" \"I'm ready to move on. So, anyway, adios,\" Baxter said, and ended the hearing.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 180 words:\nKathmandu, Nepal (CNN)When the earthquake struck, we huddled under a concrete beam -- and prayed. In another room, my grandfather could not comprehend what was happening and, instead of seeking cover, drifted towards the window. Outside, a brown dust-cloud rose from the ruins of cottages that had dotted the next hill. I was at my uncle's place in Ramkot, west Kathmandu, some 12 kilometers (7.4 miles) east from my family home. After escaping the building for the safety of open air, my first thought was for news of friends and family. Calls didn't go through but thankfully texts and data did. I heard from everyone except my mother. Worried sick, I foolishly went into the house for a second time to get my belongings and leave for home. Another tremor -- the first of many to aftershocks that have continued to strike an already traumatized city -- shook the house. I took refuge under the same doorway. The journey towards my family home in Sifal was a map of quake destruction, with many houses -- old and new -- torn apart. A high wall surrounding a monastery had collapsed and the nuns had run to a nearby field. A mud-and-brick cottage had fallen on a blue motorbike but no trace could be found of its rider. A woman perched on top of rubble tried to reach for a water container from what used to be her kitchen. Everywhere, survivors gathered wherever they could find open space -- fields, private compounds, empty roadside lots. In Chhauni, an ice cream seller ran double-time with his cart, while his radio relayed the latest. Further ahead, a mother and daughter sat down on a pavement so that a grandchild could be fed. Across the Bishnumati River, uphill towards Maru, I ran to get away from the tall houses and made towards the Kathmandu Durbar Area. It was reduced to rubble. A blood donation camp was said to be buried by the same structure that sheltered it. Locals were searching for survivors, but progress was slow. The Kasthamandap temple had caved in. Temples that sat on impressive staircase-style pyramids were now dust. The western façade of the Basantapur palace had fallen apart and nothing remained of the remained of the nine-story medieval palace nearby. Meanwhile, the curio fleamarket was flooded with people who had made it out of the cramped quarters of Jhocchen, Indra Chowk, New Road, and nearby neighborhoods. In Putalisadak, I met a cousin who was sitting an entrance exam for a prestigious high school when the quake hit before the allotted time was over. He kept wondering out loud whether he could retake the test. The two of us walked through Bagbajar, trying to trace a few acquaintances, and up Dillibajar to Kamalpokhari. A hawker was selling momos -- a Nepalese type of dumpling -- under a seven-story building, while policemen guarded a jailhouse. People gathered mostly in the middle of crossroads, on traffic islands and around metal pulpits, which looked out of range of falling buildings. The aftershocks kept coming. I reached home and found both my parents alive and uninjured. I couldn't believe that our 30-year-old house was still standing. As I walked my cousin to where his parents were, we kept hearing rumors:  \"More quakes forecast by experts for 5 p.m. and midnight.\" As if to confirm, tremors shook us at six and more would follow at 10 p.m. and midnight, with smaller shocks throughout the night. Along the northern boundary of the former royal museum, the wall had collapsed and people had poured out of the Uttar Dhoka neighborhood onto the palace lawn. Green military tents meant for two people were now packed with six and the army was trying hard to accommodate as many as possible. In Thamel, an electricity pole had squashed an abandoned taxi. A few men took turns taking photos with the wrecked car. In Kantipath, a handful of backpackers were discussing where to make camp. Back home, my parents decided against going to the nearby Sifal Chaur football field where families were sleeping on plastic mattresses under rudimentary tents. Instead, their tactic was to stay on the ground floor, be awakened by tremors, and then scamper to a corner of our garden that seemed relatively safe. I did not sleep a wink.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 161 words:\nAtlanta  (CNN)\"Do you use toilet paper?\" That's the question 26-year-old Anamarie Shreeves receives most often. It's not exactly a typical question, but Shreeves, who lives in Atlanta and is the site manager for the nonprofit Keep Atlanta Beautiful, lives what some may consider an atypical lifestyle: She creates almost no waste. The list of things she doesn't use would send shivers up a consumer marketer's spine: No plastic packaging, no new clothing, no metal cans, no cars (and in turn, no gas). The small amount of waste Shreeves does create goes straight into a 32-ounce mason jar that sits three-quarters full right next to her kitchen sink. Its contents include produce stickers, some paper tea bag wrappers and a long, twisted piece of cotton that went around her toes for a recent pedicure. This is all the waste she has collected in nearly half a year. That's right, EVERYTHING. Six month's worth of garbage for Shreeves is similar to what the average person generates in half a day. A Maryland native, Shreeves considered herself an \"Earth advocate\" from a fairly young age. Of her four brothers and sisters, she says she was always the one wading in the creek that passed by her backyard, climbing trees and pushing her family to stop being so wasteful. \"I got them their first recycling bin,\" she said. Shreeves began her journey into zero-waste living two years ago. She had just quit her job working in television and decided to move to Ecuador for a few months. Before she left she resolved to get rid of as much of her stuff as possible. She had read a blog post by a woman who lives a zero waste life in New York called the No Trash Project, and she was inspired. \"The average person throws away a ton of trash a year,\" Shreeves said. \"One single person. For her to go to zero like that, I was just amazed.\" Upon her return from Ecuador, Shreeves decided to take the lifestyle she started before she left to the next level. In April of last year, she officially began to live zero waste. Simplifying her existence wasn't easy. She had to rid herself of old habits. In the first week, she filled up half the mason jar with paper towels after grabbing them to dry her hands, just out of habit. It also took a while to feel comfortable with the funny stares she would get after politely asking food vendors to put her sandwiches and salads into her metal tin instead of paper and plastic containers. But she stayed strong and a year later she is at the point where she composts, makes her own shampoo, toothpaste and even uses reusable feminine products. And yes, she does use toilet paper -- the kind that's quickly biodegradable. The key to making it all work is an enormous amount of preparation. Shreeves packs her bags every day with a cup to drink out of, a metal tin and a reusable fork and knife, a cloth napkin and a couple canvas bags. This allows her to avoid the waste that comes so often with prepared foods. She has also had to stop going to some of her favorite restaurants and coffee shops because they won't provide reusable kitchenware. Shreeves acknowledges that with this lifestyle come certain restrictions; she has learned to make most of her food from scratch to avoid packaging. She also has to put more time into getting places by bike or public transportation. But without a doubt, the rewards for her outweigh the inconveniences. \"The quality of life that I experience as a zero waster far exceeds my life before. It's made me appreciate the things that I do have. I wouldn't want to be in another space,\" she said. To learn more about cutting down on waste, visit Shreeves' blog, fortnegrita.com.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nCiudad Juarez, Mexico, was once known as the murder capital of the world. Back in 2010, at the height of cartel violence, the city averaged 8.5 killings per day. But five years later, local officials say the city is much safer, and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to Juarez. This month the city launched the tourism campaign \"Juarez is Waiting for You.\" The rebranding effort started quietly a year ago, and on April 10, it was on full display. Mayor Enrique Serrano officially kicked off the campaign, giving what he called an \"unprecedented\" high-profile tour to regional leaders from the United States and Mexico. U.S. Rep. Robert \"Beto\" O'Rourke of Texas was one of those on a leg of the Juarez tour. His congressional district includes El Paso, Texas, which sits directly across the Rio Grande. O'Rourke says there's good reason for locals to be hopeful. \"As a region, El Paso and Juarez represent 20% of all U.S-Mexico trade. The binational ties are strong and have remained strong,\" O'Rourke says. \"Yes, we had a really difficult time for a ... period. Juarez was at one time the deadliest city in the world.\" O'Rourke speaks of a time between 2009 and 2012 when men, women and children were killed indiscriminately. Many were helplessly caught in the cartel violence. Others were victims of the drug turf war. It wasn't that long ago, O'Rourke says, that he thought twice about crossing the bridge into Juarez. \"(Now) I travel to Juarez regularly to have lunch or meet people or just to go. I always feel safe and secure.\" A spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN that at one point, there were days when Juarez had more than 20 killings. \"That was normal,\" spokesman Julio Castaneda told CNN. \"It's safer now.\" The numbers from the attorney general's office seem to bear that out. More than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago, but so far this year there have been 89 killings, according to Castaneda -- a dramatic decrease in the violence. \"Undoubtedly, the work we did here in the past year with the police institutions, and specifically the local police, helped. There was a coordinated effort between agencies,\" Castaneda said. \"Without a doubt this work played a part in breaking apart the gangs that were plaguing the city.\" The government cleaned up corruption within the local police force, and fired or arrested a lot of bad cops who were helping the cartels. Another factor that may have helped: The turf war between the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels essentially ended, with the Sinaloa cartel claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in Juarez. O'Rourke argues that the El Paso-Juarez border is \"safer than it's ever been.\" He cites the \"30 million lawful crosses from El Paso into Juarez\" last year as a symbolic step. Yet there are those who don't want to celebrate too soon. \"For Juarez to be considered a safe city, there's a long way to go,\" says Sergio Meza, executive director for Plan Estrategico de Juarez, an independent organization that works to improve the city's quality of life. \"Just this past year (in 2014) there were 424 homicides. In 2007, there were 272. Yes, we're not as bad. But we're still very sick,\" Meza told CNN from his office in Juarez. \"In reality, we're progressing from the conditions that were generated by the insecurity. We're still working out the corruption in the city. It's still an issue here.\" With more than 40% of Juarez living below the poverty line, according to Plan Estrategico de Juarez, the future of the city will depend on \"the people's participation in public matters.\" In fact, the organization's slogan is \"Nothing is fixed alone. Participate.\" \"We are looking at a compromised future,\" Meza said. \"We don't talk about that. We don't have the money to generate work here.\" One bright spot: U.S. investment is making a comeback. American companies Delphi, Honeywell, Flextronics and Lear are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in Juarez over the last year. That hiring would have been hard to imagine four years ago. But with the average salary at $20 per week for local workers in the maquiladores, or factories, along the U.S.-Mexico border in Juarez, Meza says more needs to be done. The scars from the recent past remain. Several buildings downtown are shuttered and marred by graffiti. Americans who, before the violence, came to Juarez for bargain shopping have not returned in the numbers seen before the spike in violence. But in a sign of progress, the U.S. State Department amended its travel warning for the city. While it still urges visitors to exercise appropriate caution, it's no longer telling people not to come. Longtime residents of Juarez and neighboring El Paso may be reluctant to say the wounds of the violent past have altogether healed. In the last year, however, they have definitely noticed that \"life is back.\" \"I measure it by the everyday coming and going of people,\" Gustavo Reveles, 39, told CNN. \"For someone who grew up on the border and for someone who spent half of his life crossing the border on a weekly basis, it's encouraging to be crossing back to Juarez without that sort of hesitation or worry that something might happen.\" Reveles lived in Juarez until he was 15 and now lives in El Paso. He says the threat of violence is \"still a little bit concerning,\" though that hasn't stopped him in recent weeks from going to Juarez to meet friends for dinner and drinks. \"Things have changed,\" he said. \"To go through what Juarez went through, you see life there again. You see a semblance of what was there before. To really recover and heal wounds, there's a long way to go, but the process has started and that's a step in the right direction.\" CNNMoney's Octavio Blanco contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

When you're exploring the fields at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Murfreesboro, Arkansas, the odds are higher than usual. \"Are you going to bless me and let me find a diamond today?\" That was Susie Clark's prayer on April 23, according to the state park service. Soon after, Clark, who is from Evening Shade, Arkansas, saw a 3.69-carat white, teardrop-shaped diamond in the plowed field. Inspired by her prayer, Clark named it the Hallelujah Diamond. She plans to keep it. The diamond, which is the largest found at the park so far this year, is about the size of a pinto bean, says park interpreter Waymon Cox. \"And it's the largest one found since April 16, 2014, when a 6.19-carat white diamond, named the Limitless Diamond, was found at the park,\" he said, according to a park press release. It's the 122nd diamond found at Crater of Diamonds this year. Visitors get to keep what they find at the state park's 37.5-acre search field, which is named for an ancient eruption that scattered the area with gems. The area, which became a state park in 1972, is the only public site in the world where -- for a small fee -- anyone can dig for diamonds and keep them. It's not clear how much the diamond is worth, and park officials aren't trained to appraise them, according to the park website. But Oklahoman Tara Clymer sold a 3.85-carat diamond she found at the park last year for $20,000. 50 states, 50 spots: Natural wonders. Park staff regularly plow the area to bring more diamonds to the surface for visitors to discover. The 40.23-carat Uncle Sam, the nation's largest diamond, was found in 1924, and the \"perfect\" 3.03-carat Strawn-Wagner diamond was found in 1990. The Strawn-Wagner Diamond was cut in 1997 by the renowned diamond firm Lazare Kaplan International of New York. The now 1.09-carat diamond is on display at the park visitor center. The park stretches for more than 900 acres along the Little Missouri River, but the diamond field is the main attraction. More than 75,000 diamonds have been discovered there since farmer John Huddleston discovered gems on what was then his property in 1906.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "A woman named Susie Clark from Arkansas found a 3.69-carat diamond, named the Hallelujah Diamond, at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Murfreesboro on April 23, 2023. She prayed for a diamond before finding it. It's the largest diamond found at the park this year and the largest one since 2014. Visitors can keep what they find, and the diamond field, which became a state park in 1972, is the only public site in the world where people can dig for diamonds and keep them. The largest diamond found at the park is the 40.23-carat Uncle Sam, discovered in 1924. The Strawn-Wagner diamond, found in 1990 and cut in 1997, is now a 1.09-carat diamond on display at the visitor center. Over 75,000 diamonds have been discovered at the park since 1906. The diamond field covers more than 37.5 acres.",

Lewis Hamilton took victory for the Silver Arrows at the Chinese Grand Prix -- only for his teammate Nico Rosberg to later claim he had ruined his race by driving slowly. The reigning world champion captured his 35th grand prix win with a peerless pole-to-flag win under Shanghai's sunny skies. \"It was great to have a smooth weekend,\" the British racer said before spraying the champagne on the podium. \"The team have done a fantastic job to up our pace and improve after our last race where we struggled a bit.\" F1 championship standings. Hamilton had lost the Malaysia Grand Prix in a strategic battle with the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel but it was business as usual in Shanghai. Rosberg came home second for Mercedes to snuff out the threat from the chasing Italian racers and renew his rivalry with Hamilton. \"It was an important comeback for the team,\" said the 2014 championship runner-up. Ferrari continued to put pressure on the world champion team with Vettel finishing third to collect his third straight podium of 2015. \"We just wanted to bring the podium back home,\" said Vettel, a four-time world champion with Red Bull Racing. \"It's been three out of three so far so it feels pretty good. I feel happy in the team and hopefully we can get a little bit closer to challenge these guys.\" Vettel is just 13 points behind Hamilton in the world championship and four points ahead of Rosberg, after the first three races of the year. Rosberg unhappy. It was a disheartening weekend for Rosberg -- the son of 1982 world champion Keke -- and he allowed his frustrations to spill over for the first time this season. On Saturday, Hamilton beat him to pole position by just 0.042 seconds and Rosberg complained to his engineers on the pit to car radio: \"Oh, come on guys!\" Then the German insisted his race was hampered when he found himself sandwiched between race leader Hamilton and Vettel, both of whom had stopped for fresh tyres a few laps earlier. \"Lewis is driving very slowly. Tell him to speed up,\" Rosberg told the Mercedes pit wall. Mercedes then instructed Hamilton on the team radio: \"OK Lewis we'd like to pick the pace up a little bit.\" Rosberg complained after the race that Hamilton's lackadaisical Sunday driving was holding him up, pushing him back into Vettel's thrall and taking life out of his tyres. \"It's interesting to hear from you Lewis about your pace up front,\" Rosberg said in the post-race media conference. \"That was compromising my race. Driving slowly, that was unnecessary, and meant Sebastian was closer to me. \"It cost me a lot of time ... I'm unhappy about that of course.\" Hamilton responded: \"It's not my job to look after Nico's race. It's my job to bring the car home. \"I didn't do anything intentionally to slow the cars down. If Nico had wanted to get by he could have tried, but he didn't.\" Bahrain. Hamilton has won two grands prix in 2015 while Rosberg has yet to climb onto the top step of the podium. If the German is to repeat his thrilling 2014 world title challenge, which went down to the final race in Abu Dhabi, he will need to turn things around soon. Rosberg has the chance to exorcise his frustrations on track at the Bahrain Grand Prix in just seven day's time. Ferrari will hope the hot track temperatures at the desert race will help them topple Mercedes again, as they did on Sepang's sizzling circuit. The Italian team have the horsepower. Vettel finished less than three seconds behind Hamilton in China with Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen fourth. There was also a small feat further down the field as former Ferrari race winner Fernando Alonso finished his first race for the McLaren Honda partnership with 12th place in China. The Spanish double world champion missed the Australian Grand Prix because of a head injury sustained in testing and then retired in Malaysia.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "In the Chinese Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton secured his 35th career win for Mercedes, while teammate Nico Rosberg accused him of ruining his race by driving slowly. Rosberg finished second, keeping Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel at bay. Hamilton leads the championship with 78 points, while Rosberg is second with 74 and Vettel third with 71. Rosberg expressed frustration after qualifying behind Hamilton by a mere 0.042 seconds and during the race when he was sandwiched between Hamilton and Vettel. Mercedes instructed Hamilton to pick up the pace, but Rosberg felt it compromised his race. Hamilton denied intentionally slowing down. Ferrari's Vettel finished third, just 13 points behind Hamilton. Rosberg will look to bounce back at the Bahrain Grand Prix, where Ferrari hopes the hot temperatures will aid their challenge to Mercedes. Fernando Alonso finished 12th for McLaren Honda in his first race of the season.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 180 words:\nRoseanne Barr revealed earlier this week that she is going blind. In an interview with The Daily Beast, the 62-year-old comic talked about her struggle with macular degeneration and glaucoma — two eye diseases that get progressively worse over time and can steal vision. Barr's doctors haven't provided a timeline, but her symptoms are worsening: \"My vision is closing in now,\" she said. \"I just try and enjoy vision as much as possible. Y'know, living it up.\" Related: 9 worst eye care mistakes you're making. Macular degeneration is a breakdown of the part of the retina that allows us to see fine details in the center of vision; while glaucoma damages the nerve that connects the retina to the brain, and is often caused by fluid build-up and pressure in the eyes. (Barr said in the interview that she helps relieve the pressure by using marijuana, which is known to temporarily lower pressure inside the eye.) \"It's somewhat unusual that Roseanne Bar has both, but not unheard of,\" explains ophthalmologist Steven A. Shanbom, MD, of Shanbom Eye Specialists in Berkley, Mich. Though there are some controllable risk factors, certain people are genetically predisposed to these diseases, so Barr may simply be prone to both. \"Certainly it's sad. The combination of the two is terrible. Macular degeneration takes away her central vision, and glaucoma is taking away her peripheral vision,\" Dr. Shanbom adds. (He is not treating Roseanne Barr, and does not know the specifics of her case.) The risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60, with some people, especially African Americans, at higher risk in their 40s. That's why the American Academy of Opthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4-0, even if you have perfect vision. In the early stages, you can have either condition, but have no symptoms at all. Things like a family history or high blood pressure, or issues within the eye (like having a thinner cornea, for example) might lead your MD to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half. Related: 10 natural ways to lower blood pressure. There is no cure for either disease. But like those eyedrops, there are treatments that may delay the progression of early-stage glaucoma (from other drugs to surgery), and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration (including an implantable telescope). The future looks brighter however: An animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early-stage macular degeneration. There are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases. Here, five ways to protect your peepers. Slip on your shades—even when it's cloudy. Sun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration, as well as cataracts (clouding of the lenses). Make sure your sunglasses offer 99% to 100% UV protection. Sporting a pair that doesn't filter UV light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all, because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays. Schedule in a regular walk. Studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma, and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, all you need to do is raise your pulse 20% to 25% (which could mean a brisk walk) for 20 minutes, a minimum of four times a week. Related: 9 tweaks that make walking workouts more effective. Eat your greens. Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin—antioxidants that lower your risk of developing macular degeneration (and cataracts too), research shows. Another good source: egg yolks. Snack on almonds, citrus, and berries. Almonds are loaded with vitamin E (a handful provides about half your daily dose), which slows macular degeneration; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin C, which cuts your odds of developing the disease. Avoid cigarette smoke. While smoking is bad news for many parts of your body, you may not have considered eyes to be one of them. However, smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration. Avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart, it can protect your peepers too.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 170 words:\nWhen the earthquake hit, many of Nepal's most renowned pagodas in and around Kathmandu crumbled into rubble-covered stumps. Others were smothered under splintered hand-carved wooden beams or multi-level rooftops. But the Kathmandu Valley's other pagodas, stupas and shrines -- also built mostly of red brick hundreds of years ago -- suffered surprisingly little damage and remained standing next to  structures which disappeared. The worst architectural losses have included the majestic Shiva temple pagoda and its twin, the Narayan temple pagoda, which dominated Kathmandu's main Durbar Square. From the late 1960s onwards, Western hippy backpackers who traveled the legendary overland route to Kathmandu would climb the Shiva pagoda's wide, nine-step plinth, sit in the shade under the triple-layered roofs, smoke hashish and enjoy the lofty view. But now the two pagodas have been obliterated and the scene comprises pathetic piles of rubble, a bulldozer shoveling a path for vehicles, shocked and miserable witnesses and a sense of irreplaceable visual and spiritual loss -- unless the structures are eventually rebuilt. The Shiva temple pagoda may have been hundreds of years old, but before its destruction impoverished rickshaw drivers, coolies and others would publicly urinate into the gutter surrounding it while waiting for passengers or heavy loads to transport. The slightly shorter, triple-roofed Narayan pagoda allowed vegetable sellers to display their foodstuff on the temple's broad, five-level base. Both pagodas also served as public platforms. Jostling crowds of Nepalis and foreigners used to gather there because the plinths' height above street level allowed excellent views of major Hindu processions and other events. Those two landmarks fronted the enclosed dwelling place of Nepal's Hindu virgin goddess, or Kumari, whose ornate front of bricks, statues and carved wood seem to have survived the initial quakes. It is not immediately known if the inner courtyard and rooms are safe. On the other side of Durbar Square, the brick-and-wood Shiva-Parvati temple house -- where the Hindu gods Shiva and his consort Parvati shelter -- appear to also have survived. On Kathmandu's outskirts the town of Patan suffered terrible damage when its central Durbar Square lost several pagodas as structures pancaked straight down while others merely shook and cracked. Fortunately others appear to still be standing, including the Sundari Chowk temple and a surviving lucky trio of holy structures: the gray stone, Mogul-influenced Krishna Mandir; the 17th-century Bishwa Nath Mandir with its large stone elephants at the entrance; and the nearby smaller 17th-century Bimsen Mandi \"god of the traders\" pagoda. Several miles away from Kathmandu, witnesses have been unable to immediately confirm the levels of destruction which have occurred in the lavish town of Bhaktapur. The locality had undergone years of extensive restoration work thanks to foreign and local artists and funding. The town offset some of that cost by charging tourists a fee to enter its central area, which displayed refined temples, pagodas, shrines and even a restaurant built into a main pagoda, allowing diners to view the best sites while munching their meals. Elsewhere in the Kathmandu Valley, the white-topped dome of the Boudhanath Stupa remains standing, but its smaller neighboring stupa has shown some damage from the quake. The Boudhanath Stupa is prized by Tibetan Buddhist refugees who have fled their Chinese-occupied homeland on foot through the Himalaya mountains. They are often seen reverently walking in a circle around the stupa's base while twirling \"prayer wheels\" and chanting. There has been no news as yet on damage caused to other famous places of Hindu and Buddhist worship, including the hilltop Swayambhunath temple on the outskirts of Kathmandu. That imposing structure is popularly known as the \"Monkey Temple\" because its often vicious wild monkeys are allowed to scamper among the trees on the temple's hill, terrifying visitors who have to hike up a lengthy stairway to reach the temples, shrines, shops and monks' residences.. The fate of the Pashupatinath Temple complex near Kathmandu's international airport is also not known. Pashupatinath's multiple pagodas and shrines flank its public funeral pyres which emit smoke whenever human corpses are routinely cremated before the ashes are dumped into a narrow river.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nEternally blooming in Kolkata, India, along the Hooghly River is Malik Ghat, a wholesale flower market that attracts more than 2,000 sellers each day. Photographer Ken Hermann visited the market for his project \"Flower Man,\" which is a series of portraits that casts light upon the people behind the petals. When Hermann was in Kolkata working on another assignment, he went to the market as a tourist. After that first encounter with Malik Ghat, his captivation with the market did not diminish and he became intent on returning. \"(The flower sellers) woke my curiosity. But at that time, I didn't really have the time to do the project,\" Hermann said. \"And this idea just kind of stuck in my head for almost two years.\" Hermann was able to spend about 10 days at the market, and did not allow any challenges to hinder the completion of \"Flower Man.\" He said that in addition to language barriers and the heat of Kolkata making communication complicated and shooting at certain times difficult, another adversity he faced was taking portraits of the female flower sellers. \"I had a really clear idea before I went (to the market) about what I wanted to do,\" Hermann said. \"I wanted to shoot the sellers -- the male and the female sellers.\" But none of the female flower sellers wished to be a part of Hermann's project, so he focused only on those who were interested in and comfortable with having their portrait taken. For the portraits, Hermann sought a neutral background. He first tried shooting under a bridge near the market, but quickly realized the lighting did not match the mood he wanted to create. He then decided to create the portraits by the Hooghly River. This allowed him to combine the hazy smog in the air, sunlight from above and studio lights of his own, which culminated to produce a surreal effect and overexposed look that made his subjects stand out. \"All the pictures are shot within noon and 3 p.m. when you have the sun straight from above, which gives (the portraits) this very hard light,\" Hermann said. \"And then I just used some studio light as a fill to make it a little bit more soft.\" Although the composition of the majority of Hermann's portraits encompasses the flower sellers in front of a neutral background, other portraits forgo this characteristic and consequently bring a sense of movement and fluidity to \"Flower Man.\" Viewers may see people or a dog appearing in a frame, or even birds flying in the sky and a boat floating in the water. One of the reasons Hermann did not create the flower sellers' portraits directly inside the market is because of the hectic atmosphere. Hermann compares Malik Ghat to the environments of financial trading and fish markets. \"It's impossible to shoot at the market, especially if you want a clean and quiet background, because there's so much going on,\" Hermann said. Social media. Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Similar to the commitment needed to effectively and successfully operate within the financial and food industries, Hermann emphasized that the competitive atmosphere of the market and work ethic of the flower sellers was a major factor in whether a seller would agree to have their portrait made. \"All the other sellers -- they are so busy, so just convincing them to go near the river to get their portrait done and spend maybe 15 minutes of their time was a challenge,\" Hermann said. \"Because every minute they're not standing in the flower (market), they lose money.\" Hermann said that another important reason some flower sellers decided not to be photographed was because flowers are highly valued in India and serve as a prominent feature during many events and moments in people's lives, including everything from religious rituals and festivals to weddings and parties. \"Some of the flowers, (the sellers) didn't allow us to take pictures of because they're flowers used for offering in the temple,\" Hermann said. \"It was more a problem about the flowers than actually the guy behind, because they didn't want us to take the pictures because (the flowers would) lose their purity.\" Challenging perceptions and breaking down barriers are underlying elements within \"Flower Man.\" Hermann said viewers must not make assumptions about the socioeconomic status of the sellers, nor should they view the sellers through a fixed, rigid lens regarding the behaviors and roles associated with gender. Noticeable throughout the portraits is that none of the sellers is smiling, which is usually a behavior people tend to exhibit when in the presence of a camera. The lack of a smile enhances the organic nature of \"Flower Man,\" making the portraits a powerful representation of unforced and unfabricated human emotion. \"If you want to take pictures in India, people tend to just stand up and look proud and strong,\" Hermann said. \"It's very different from the Western world because if you take pictures here, people tend to smile.\" Like people, flowers come in all shapes, sizes and colors. When viewing Hermann's photos, this fact leaves viewers to consider if it is not the flowers that are decorations, but rather the sellers who bring vibrancy to the flowers. In the portrait of Sanju Joshi, for example, he is engulfed in endless layers of orange. \"They use these flowers in temples and all over India, so that's one of the more common flowers at the market,\" Hermann said. \"I really like that picture because they carry the flowers like it is a dress. You should see when they walk through the flower market, it's almost like (the flowers are) all alive.\" Similarly, the abundant leaves come to life in Odhir Gayen's portrait. \"These are a special kind of leaves, and many of (the sellers) carry them on their head and (on their) arms,\" Hermann said. \"And when they walk around, it's almost like a human bush or something like that.\" Hermann plans to return to Malik Ghat and looks forward not only to the opportunity to photograph different kinds of flowers -- as the range varies based on the seasons -- but also to the chance to present the flower sellers featured in \"Flower Man\" with their portraits. \"I enjoyed this project,\" Hermann said. \"There's a lot of photographers going to India and then showing a poor, bad situation. ... I have a totally different approach. I want to show some more proudness and find the beauty of people.\" Ken Hermann is a photographer based in Copenhagen.

        "answer": "Ken Hermann, a Danish photographer, spent 10 days at Malik Ghat, a bustling wholesale flower market in Kolkata, India, to capture portraits of the over 2000 sellers for his project \"Flower Man.\" Hermann was initially drawn to the market during a tourist visit but was unable to start the project at that time. He returned two years later, determined to cast light on the people behind the petals.\n\nDespite challenges such as language barriers, extreme heat, and the hectic market atmosphere, Hermann persisted in creating portraits with a surreal effect by the Hooghly River. He sought a neutral background but encountered resistance from female flower sellers, who did not wish to be photographed. Instead, he captured portraits of those who were comfortable with the process.\n\nHermann's portraits, taken between noon and 3 p.m., feature hard light and studio fill to create a unique, overexposed look. Some portraits deviate from the neutral background, bringing a sense of movement and fluidity to the series.\n\nThe competitive atmosphere and work ethic of the sellers influenced Hermann's ability to capture their portraits. Some sellers refused to be photographed due to the significance of the flowers in Indian culture and the fear that their purity would be compromised.\n\n\"",

Less than an hour after he was detained, officers transporting him called for a medic. He subsequently slipped into a coma, dying a week after his initial arrest. So what happened? The events surrounding Gray's encounter with police remain unclear. To shed light on what happened, police released a more detailed timeline of events on Monday, and officials speaking at a news conference elaborated on specifics of the events. \"We want to clear up some of the confusions that may exist,\" Baltimore Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez said. \"We will be looking specifically at our actions from the point that we came into contact with Mr. Gray up until the time we requested medical assistance -- specifically, did we miss any warnings? Should we have acted sooner? Should we have acted in any different manner?\" This is what police say occurred:. ---. 8:39:12 a.m., Sunday, April 12. At the corner of North Avenue and Mount Street in Baltimore, a police officer makes eye contact with two individuals, one of them Gray. Both individuals start running southbound as officers begin pursuing them. 8:39:52 a.m. One unit (officer) says \"I got him\" at 1700 Presbury Street, two blocks south of North and Mount. 8:40:12 a.m. An officer says we've got one and confirms the address of 1700 Presbury, where Gray gave up without the use of force, according to Rodriguez. One officer took out his stun gun but did not deploy it, he said. 8:42:52 a.m. Gray asks for an inhaler. Police request a \"wagon\" to transport him. 8:46:02 a.m. The van's driver says he believes Gray is acting \"irate\" in the back, according to Rodriguez. 8:46:12 a.m. At the corner of Mount Street and Baker Street, an officer asks the vehicle driver to stop so they can finish paperwork. At that point, Gray is placed in leg irons and put back in the wagon. Police interviewed several witnesses in the community with regard to that specific stop, Rodriguez said. The videos that were filmed by bystanders show events similar to what Rodriguez describes happens at this point. 8:54:02 a.m. The wagon clears Mount Street and heads southbound towards central booking. 8:59:52 a.m. The van's driver asks for an additional unit to \"check on his prisoner [Gray],\" Rodriguez said. Another individual is arrested and a wagon is requested. Before the wagon leaves, there is \"some communication\" with Gray, according to Rodriguez. They then travel to the police cepartment/s western district with Gray and the other suspect in the wagon. The two are separated by a metal barrier and the two had no physical contact. 9:24:32 a.m. A medic is called. ---. An autopsy on Gray's body was done on Monday, according to Rodriguez. He said there was no evidence that force was used against Gray, nor did any officers describe using any force against him. \"When Mr. Gray was placed inside that van, he was able to talk, he was upset, and when Mr. gray was taken out of that van he could not talk and he could not breath,\" Rodriguez said. \"I know Mr. Gray suffered a very traumatic injury, but I don't know if it happened prior to him getting into the van or while he was in the van.\"\n\noutput:",

Even so, there were some genuinely funny moments, although the ratio was low, and you had to be patient to get to them. But when you step back and look at the event as a whole, and appreciate what's really happening -- in terms of press freedoms and even a U.S. president willing and able to poke fun at himself as well as others -- it's hard not to think of this particular Beltway-meets-showbiz event as a wonderfully American exercise in tolerance and good humor. That being said, it's a very tough room -- and not just because the Washington Hilton ballroom is so cavernous. More than 2,000 credentialed White House journalists and their mostly celebrity guests convened for the occasion. And convened, and convened, and convened, as time dragged on and dinner was served late. President Barack Obama, as Strong's warm-up act, didn't hit the podium until 10:20 p.m. (Strong got her turn at 10:45.) Obama, as in past years, came out strong -- a tough act to follow for any comedian. He had strong comedy lines and delivered them with timing that many stand-up comics would envy. Noting his lame-duck status, Obama said his advisers asked him if he had a bucket list. \"I have something that rhymes with bucket list,\" he claimed to have replied. Obama, noting the night's guest speaker, said, \"On 'Saturday Night Live,' Cecily impersonates CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin.\" Then, after a brief but well-timed pause, he added, \"Which is surprising, because usually, the only people impersonating journalists on CNN are journalists on CNN.\" Obama was nailing his own punch lines frequently, and perfectly. Then, to up the ante on his time at the podium, he welcomed his \"anger translator\" -- a recurring character played by Keegan-Michael Key on Comedy Central's \"Key & Peele.\" It was a clever surprise, and the crowd reacted with surprising enthusiasm (I wouldn't have presumed most of them knew of Key's character or his series), though Key's jokes lost something in the translation, and didn't pack the punch of Obama's. But the bit ended with a great twist: Obama himself getting so worked up about a snowball being carried into Congress to denounce global warming that the President's \"anger translator\" had to calm Obama down instead. And then came Cecily Strong, with a sly opening line referring not only to her appearance as one of the few female guest speakers at the correspondents' dinner, but to the upcoming 2016 presidential election. \"Feels right,\" she said, \"to have a woman following President Obama.\" From there, the crowd seemed as tough as advertised, with \"oohs\" often as loud as laughter, as Strong went from one target to another. She even got \"oohs\" when her targets were outside the room, as when she said, noting how Obama has aged visibly in office, \"Your hair is so white now, it can talk back to the police.\" But the seemingly tepid response to Strong's routine may have been partly due to the late hour. She came on after not only the dinner service and Obama, but after scholarship awards, correspondent awards and tributes and other bits of official business. And her routine wasn't over until 11:08 p.m. -- making it a longer TV show than even the Emmys. Before the main event finally began, C-SPAN filled the time scanning the room with its cameras, but providing only ambient sound with very few identifying voice-overs or prerecorded features. Once in a while, you could see someone recognizable in the large, oddly eclectic crowd: Tea Leoni, Ivanka Trump, Larry Wilmore, Jane Pauley. For the most part, though, it was like playing a frustratingly difficult Beltway game of spot-the-face-in-the-crowd -- a sort of \"Who's Waldo?\" And after a few hours watching a gaggle of people chat and eat, all I wanted to do was go home. And I was already home. But I stayed tuned, just so I could watch, and grade, the results. Final tally: Obama gets an A-,  Keegan-Michael Key a C, Cecily Strong a B-, and the entire telecast and event an A+ for democracy -- but a D as television.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 145 words:\nA former U.S. Navy aircraft carrier that survived a Japanese torpedo strike and was a massive guinea pig for two atomic bomb blasts looks remarkably intact at the bottom of the Pacific, according to federal researchers who surveyed the wreck last month with an underwater drone. The USS Independence was scuttled in January 1951 during weapons testing near California's Farallon Islands. Although its location was confirmed by a survey in 2009, researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration went looking for it again in March as part of a project to map about 300 wrecks that lie in and around the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. \"After 64 years on the seafloor, Independence sits on the bottom as if ready to launch its planes,\" mission leader James Delgado, the maritime heritage director for NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, said in a statement. Indeed, sonar images show what looks to be an airplane on one of the elevators that took planes from the Independence's hangar deck to its flight deck. The ship sits upright with a slight list to starboard, according to NOAA. NOAA's survey of the 623-foot-long, 11,000-ton carrier was conducted by the Echo Ranger, an 18.5-foot-long autonomous underwater vehicle provided by the Boeing Co. The Echo Ranger traveled 30 miles from its base in Half Moon Bay, California, and hovered 150 above the carrier, which lies 2,600 feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean. The drone used a three-dimensional sonar system provided by Coda Octopus to get images that showed how well the warship has weathered 64 years in the deep. \"This ship fought a long, hard war in the Pacific and after the war was subjected to two atomic blasts that ripped through the ship. It is a reminder of the industrial might and skill of the 'greatest generation' that sent not only this ship, but their loved ones to war,\" Delgado said in the statement. In its 20 years in the Navy, the ship played a role in some of the most important events of World War II, earning eight battle stars in the process, and the dawn of the nuclear age. Independence was seriously damaged by Japanese torpedo planes during the Battle of Tarawa in late 1943. The ship returned to California for repairs and made it back across the Pacific by July 1944 to participate in the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea and the sinking of one of the Japanese Imperial Navy's biggest warships, the battleship Musashi. Later, in the Battle of Cape Engano, planes from the Independence were involved in the sinking of four Japanese aircraft carriers. After the war, Independence became part of a fleet used to measure the effects of atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific on July 1, 1946. It sat just 560 yards from ground zero in the first test, a 23-kiloton air blast of a fission bomb similar to the one used over Nagasaki, Japan, a year earlier, according to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. Twenty-four days later, Independence was 1,390 yards from the center of a second atomic blast -- also a 23-kiloton device but an underwater detonation. The ship was later brought back to California for nuclear decontamination before being sunk during the weapons training in 1951. NOAA said no signs of radioactive contamination were noted during the survey of the sunken carrier last month. The agency has no plans for further missions to the ship, according to the NOAA statement.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nKabul, Afghanistan (CNN)It is an unimaginably hideous outcome. To be raped by your cousin's husband; be jailed for adultery as your attacker was married; to suffer the ignominy of global uproar about your jailing and assault, but be pardoned by presidential decree; and then to endure the shame and rejection from a conservative society that somehow held you to blame. The solution in this society? Marry your attacker. That's what happened to Gulnaz, who was barely 16 when she was raped. She's now carrying the third child of her attacker, Asadullah, who was convicted and jailed -- though this was then reduced. Gulnaz's plight -- like so much in beleaguered Afghanistan -- disappeared from the world's gaze once she was pardoned and released courtesy of a presidential pardon. Instead of a new start, what followed for Gulnaz was a quiet, Afghan solution to the \"problem\" -- a telling sign of where women's rights stand in Afghanistan despite the billions that have poured into this country from the U.S. government and its NATO allies during more than a decade of war. We found Gulnaz in her family home. Smile, the name of the daughter born of the rape, is now a shining little girl, bouncing around the house that her mother shares with Asadullah's first wife -- who is also Gulnaz's cousin. Asadullah agreed to let us speak with him and Gulnaz because, it seemed, he wanted to show us that things were now settled, that under Afghanistan's version of social morality he had done the right thing. He had rescued Gulnaz from shame. \"If I hadn't married her, (but) according to our traditions, she couldn't have lived back in society,\" he tells us. \"Her brothers didn't want to accept her back. Now, she doesn't have any of those problems.\" 2011: Thousands sign petition for Gulaz release. Gulnaz remains subdued throughout our meeting and does not once look her husband in the eye. \"I didn't want to ruin the life of my daughter or leave myself helpless so I agreed to marry him,\" she says. \"We are traditional people. When we get a bad name, we prefer death to living with that name in society.\" As Smile attempts to pour tea, the other seven children in this household run around the courtyard. The first wife remains unseen in the house. A portrait of Gulnaz's liberator in 2011, the then-president Hamid Karzai, hangs on the wall. But the sense of order here is undermined by the fact that this is a house built around a crime. How Gulnaz ended up here requires some explanation. There was pressure upon her to marry her attacker after her release. But at the same time, other activists were trying to assist her with an asylum bid abroad. \"Unfortunately, Gulnaz was heavily pressured to marry her attacker by various people within the government which, in and of itself, was immensely disappointing,\" her former attorney, an American citizen named Kimberley Motley, tells us. \"Gulnaz was constantly told that neither she nor her daughter would be protected if she did not succumb to their pressure to marry...  Gulnaz essentially became a prisoner of her environment. \"As an uneducated, young, single mother with no family support, it would have been an uphill battle for Gulnaz and her daughter.\" Local pressure won out. She was introduced to her attacker in the shelter where CNN first interviewed her upon release from prison. They talked and it was agreed she would marry him. Most disturbingly, the woman who -- despite knowing the stigma it would create around her -- defiantly insisted she had been raped when we spoke nearly four years ago, now says she was told by her relatives to make up the allegations. \"Now she is beside me and knows that it was not as big as they had shown it,\" says Asadullah. \"No I am not thinking about it anymore,\" Gulnaz adds. \"I don't have a problem with him now and I don't want to think about the past problems. My life is OK... I am happy with my life... It is going on.\" She is then permitted to talk with us alone. Asadullah moves away but stands close to the door of the room. Though she now maintains she was not raped, she explains her decision. She contradicts her husband, saying her brothers would have taken her back, had she not married him. \"My brothers opposed the marriage and told me to take my daughter and go to Pakistan to live with them instead,\" she says. \"But now we're married, they disowned me and won't see me again.\" Her decision was for her daughter. \"No, I couldn't fulfill my wishes in life. I married this man; I cut relations with my family only to buy my daughter's future.\" It is truly chilling to see how things have gone for Gulnaz after the level of international attention her story received -- pregnant with the third child of the man who was once her rapist, accepting a life as his second wife, trapped in his home.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "Gulnaz, a 16-year-old Afghan girl, was raped by her cousin's husband in 2009. After being jailed for adultery, she was pardoned by then-President Hamid Karzai and released. However, instead of receiving a new start, Gulnaz was pressured to marry her attacker, Asadullah, as a solution to the \"problem\" in Afghan society. Despite international attention and a petition with thousands of signatures for her release, Gulnaz succumbed to the pressure and married Asadullah. Now, she is carrying his third child and living with him and his first wife, who is also her cousin. Gulnaz maintains that she was not raped and that her brothers would have taken her back if she had not married Asadullah. However, they have disowned her since the marriage. The incident is a telling sign of the state of women's rights in Afghanistan, despite billions of dollars in aid from the US and its allies during the decade-long war.",

Because of that, one's response to such imagery often becomes calloused or desensitized. This concept of \"how we digest images of war through mainstream media outlets,\" was what drove photographer Simon Brann Thorpe to begin his project \"Toy Soldiers.\" This idea to create a fresh perspective drove him into the desert of Western Sahara, a long-disputed region of northwestern Africa. Thorpe uses the area's harsh landscape as a powerful backdrop for soldiers posed as green plastic figurines -- similar to the popular toys that many children play with. The soldiers are with the Polisario Front, an independence movement that has been clashing with Morocco over the region since the mid-1970s. Thorpe said his project enables \"the creation of a visual metaphor from which a viewer develops their own emotional, physical and political response to war and conflict, when faced with the realization that the images do not contain toy soldiers but real soldiers.\" Thorpe's background was not in photojournalism, but in landscape photography, which lends to his powerful placement of the soldiers in the desert -- not to mention that all the locations chosen are historic locations of battles between Morocco and the Polisario Front. \"The conflict in Western Sahara receives virtually zero coverage despite 2015 being the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of war there,\" Thorpe said. After a ceasefire in 1991, the people of Western Sahara have been living in a state of non-resolution. The people are split into two camps -- those living in Moroccan-occupied territory, and those in refugee camps in Algeria. Social media.

Thorpe had to get clearance to work with the Polisario Front military and also had to be cautious of how many troops he moved about at one time -- otherwise he would have needed permission from the United Nations. He usually worked with about 50 or 60 soldiers at a time. The autumn months did not offer much reprieve from the long hours in the sweltering desert sun. Thorpe would work with the troops' commander to position the men, then climb atop sandy mountains with his wide-angle lens and capture these striking images. They would work till dusk and then spend the night under the stars. Not only were the soldiers willing participants for this project, but they also helped construct the platforms they stood on. Thorpe said they were made out of old oil drums. After the elaborate five-week production, Thorpe hopes his images will raise questions on \"how images of war (will) be consumed in the future with ever-diminishing attention spans and competition for them.\" Simon Brann Thorpe's \"Toy Soldiers\" book is available for pre-order through Dewi Lewis Publishing.

Exactly one week after being taken into police custody in Baltimore, Freddie Gray died Sunday under circumstances that are unclear. \"The questions that many of you have are the same questions that we're asking: How was Mr. Gray injured? Were our proper protocols and procedures actually followed? What are the next steps to take from here?\" said Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. An attorney for Gray's family alleges that police are involved in a cover-up. \"On last Sunday morning at about 8 a.m., the police chased Freddie Gray, a ... healthy man, without any evidence he had committed a crime. His take-down and arrest without probable cause occurred under a police video camera, which taped everything including the police dragging and throwing Freddy into a police vehicle while he screamed in pain,\" attorney William Murphy Jr. said in a statement. Video recorded at the scene shows Gray, with his hands behind his back, screaming as police raise him to his feet. They drag him to a waiting van. \"He lapsed into a coma, died, was resuscitated, stayed in a coma and on Monday, underwent extensive surgery at Shock Trauma to save his life. He clung to life for seven days and died today at approximately 7 a.m.  We believe the police are keeping the circumstances of Freddie's death secret until they develop a version of events that will absolve them of all responsibility,\" said Murphy. The attorney added that Gray's spinal cord was severely injured. At this point, police are declining to say much about the case, citing ongoing administrative and criminal investigations. They have not released the incident report, nor have they released the names of the officers involved. They have said that those officers have been placed on administrative duties. When asked why officers first encountered Gray, Baltimore Police Dept. Capt. Eric Kowalczyk told CNN that they had been working in an area known for violent crime and drug sales. When the officers approached him, Gray fled, Kowalczyk said. Gray's death comes amid a string of recent deaths involving white officers and black suspects. The death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, touched off protests and sparked a nationwide debate over race and policing. Brown, an unarmed black teen, was shot by Darren Wilson, a white officer, last August. According to CNN affiliate WJZ, protesters rallied over the weekend in Baltimore, demanding answers. \"Our hope and goal here is to be as informative as we can without compromising the criminal investigation,\" said Kowalczyk. \"We're very troubled by this. We want to find out the answers as much as the public does.\" CNN's Vivan Kuo and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 173 words:\nA New York jury deliberating the fate of the man charged with the 1979 killing of 6-year-old Etan Patz is struggling to reach a verdict. The little boy's disappearance, more than three decades ago, sparked an era of heightened awareness of crimes against children. Deliberations resumed on Thursday, one day after New York Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley ordered the jury to continue efforts to reach a decision on the guilt or innocence of a bodega worker named Pedro Hernandez. On the 10th day of deliberations, the jurors on Wednesday said in a note that they were unable to reach a unanimous decision. Hernandez confessed to police three years ago, but his lawyers said he made up his account of the crime. Etan Patz's parents have waited more than 35 years for justice, but some have questioned whether that is even possible in Hernandez's case. His lawyer has said that he is mentally challenged, severely mentally ill and unable to tell whether he committed the crime or not. Hernandez told police in a taped statement that he lured Patz into a basement as the boy was on his way to a bus stop in Lower Manhattan. He said he killed the boy and threw his body away in a plastic bag. Neither the child nor his remains have ever been recovered. But Hernandez has been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and has an \"IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range,\" his attorney Harvey Fishbein has said. Police interrogated Hernandez for 7½ hours before he confessed. \"I think anyone who sees these confessions will understand that when the police were finished, Mr. Hernandez believed he had killed Etan Patz. But that doesn't mean he actually did, and that's the whole point of this case,\" Fishbein has said. But in November, a New York judge ruled that Hernandez's confession and his waiving of his Miranda rights were legal, making the confession admissible in court. Hernandez is charged with two counts of second-degree murder for allegedly intending to cause the boy's death and for a killing that occurred during a kidnapping. Another man's name has also hung over the Patz case for years -- Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's babysitter. Etan's parents, Stan and Julia Patz, sued Ramos in 2001. The boy was officially declared dead as part of that lawsuit. A judge found Ramos responsible for the boy's death and ordered him to pay the family $2 million -- money the Patz family has never received. Though Ramos was at the center of investigations for years, he has never been charged. He served a 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania for molesting another boy and was set to be released in 2012. He was immediately rearrested upon leaving jail in 2012 on charges of failing to register as a sex offender, The Associated Press reported. Since their young son's disappearance, the Patzes have worked to keep the case alive and to create awareness of missing children in the United States. In the early 1980s, Etan's photo appeared on milk cartons across the country, and news media focused in on the search for him and other missing children. \"It awakened America,\" said Ernie Allen, president and chief executive officer of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. \"It was the beginning of a missing children's movement.\" The actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it's always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed, experts said. But the news industry was expanding to cable television, and sweet images of children appeared along with distraught parents begging for their safe return. The fear rising across the nation sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police. In 1984, Congress passed the Missing Children's Assistance Act, which led to the creation of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. President Ronald Reagan opened the center in a White House ceremony in 1984. It soon began operating a 24-hour toll-free hot line on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls. CNN's Lorenzo Ferrigno and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nAs a boat packed with hundreds of migrants capsized in Mediterranean waters, many were trapped inside behind locked doors. That's the account one survivor of the deadly shipwreck gave to investigators, according to a statement released Sunday by prosecutors in Catania, Italy. The Bangladeshi migrant's description provides new details about what may have happened aboard the ship, which sent out a distress call in the dark of night Saturday after a couple of days at sea. As rescuers approached, authorities say migrants on the boat moved to one side, hoping to be saved. Their movement caused the large, multilevel boat to capsize about 110 kilometers (almost 70 miles) north of Libya, sending the desperate crowd plunging into the sea, their chance of survival slim. The migrant, who spoke to investigators after being airlifted to a hospital in Catania, is among dozens who authorities say were saved from the sinking vessel. He told investigators there were 950 people on board -- a number prosecutors haven't verified. Maltese authorities, who are working with Italian rescuers, earlier said around 50 of 700 people on the boat had been saved. Many on lower levels of the boat were trapped inside because smugglers had locked the doors, the migrant said, according to prosecutors. The Italian Coast Guard is collecting statements from other survivors, prosecutors said. It was the latest in a series of dangerous voyages for hundreds of men, women and children who boarded the boat in Libya, hoping to make it safely to Europe. Passengers on the boat were from a number of nations, including Algeria, Egypt, Somalia, Niger, Senegal, Mali, Zambia, Bangladesh and Ghana, prosecutors said. While the shipwreck was an accident, Malta's Prime Minister slammed the human traffickers who he accused of risking people's lives by putting them on rickety ships in unpredictable waters. \"Gangs of criminals are putting people on a boat, sometimes even at gunpoint,\" Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said. \"They're putting them on the road to death, really, and nothing else.\" It's \"genocide -- nothing less than genocide, really,\" Muscat told CNN. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said that the incident could be worse than an incident last week in which 400 refugees and migrants died in the Mediterranean. \"Our troops, together with the Italian navy, are literally looking through the bodies to try to find someone who's still alive,\" Muscat said of the latest incident at sea. Flavio Di Giacomo, spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, told CNN that survivors were taken to Sicily. The Italian Coast Guard, which is leading the rescue operation, reported that at least 24 bodies had been recovered so far at the shipwreck site. Security for Libya's borders is essential to \"take out these criminal gangs -- these terrorists,\" Muscat said.  The international community  \"cannot continue to turn a blind eye,\" he added. The leader of the international nonpartisan medical organization Doctors Without Borders had strong words Sunday for the tragedy. \"A mass grave is being created in the Mediterranean Sea and European policies are responsible,\" said the group's president, Loris De Filippi. He compared the high number of deaths to \"figures from a war zone.\" De Filippi called on European states to immediately launch large-scale search-and-rescue operations with proactive patrolling as close as possible to Libyan shores. \"Faced with thousands of desperate people fleeing wars and crises, Europe has closed borders, forcing people in search of protection to risk their lives and die at sea,\" he said. \"This tragedy is only just beginning, but it can and should be stopped.\" Doctors Without Borders will begin its own rescue effort, he added, because \"as a medical, humanitarian organization, we simply cannot wait any longer.\" French President Francois Hollande called for the European Union to help more in the rescue. If the deaths are in the hundreds, he said, the accident could be \"the worst disaster in recent years in the Mediterranean.\" Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi called an emergency Cabinet meeting in Rome. Speaking to journalists later, he defended Italy's response. \"Adding 10 more vessels\" to patrol the Mediterranean, Renzi said, wouldn't solve the root of why the tragedy occurred. \"This has to be clear: there was not an absence (of rescue vessels) which led to the disaster. And this is the proof that if you want to eradicate the problem from the root, you have to respond in a different way. And what we're doing in the next few hours will show this.\" Renzi said the focus needs to be on eradicating human trafficking and that the responsibility lies with the whole world, \"not just Italy and Malta.\" Human Rights Watch urged the EU to act quickly. \"The EU is standing by with arms crossed while hundreds die off its shores,\" said Judith Sunderland, deputy Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \"These deaths might well have been prevented if the EU had launched a genuine search-and-rescue effort.\" The EU released a statement Sunday saying that it planned action down the road but didn't detail any immediate plans to help with the search for the victims of this accident. \"The European Commission is deeply chagrined by the tragic developments in the Mediterranean today, but also over the past days and weeks. The reality is stark and our actions must therefore be bold. These are human lives at stake, and the European Union as a whole has a moral and humanitarian obligation to act,\" it said. The EU is consulting member states, European agencies and international organizations to prepare what it called a European Migration Strategy, which would be adopted in middle May. It stressed the need to \"address the situation at its roots.\" \"And as long as countries of origin and transit do not take action to prevent these desperate trips, people will continue to put their lives at risk,\" the statement read. Many of the migrants who board ships to cross the Mediterranean are from sub-Saharan Africa, and travel for weeks just to get to the ships. They're seeking a better life, but many are exploited by the traffickers who organize the voyages. Already this year, more than 900 migrants are believed to have died while crossing the Mediterranean -- far more than during the same period in 2014, the International Organization for Migration said Friday. In one four-day period alone, more than 8,000 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian Coast Guard. On one day alone, SOS calls came in from 20 boats in distress. Roberta Metsola, a Maltese member of the European Parliament, told CNN on Sunday that countries from Northern Europe need to share the responsibility with their southern neighbors. \"The people are going to continue to arrive,\" she said. \"The desperation subsists -- there are almost a million people waiting to board boats and come to Europe to seek a better life. And that fact has to be recognized.\" Journalist Barbie Nadeau and CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome; CNN's Jethro Mullen reported Hong Kong, and CNN's Ashley Fantz, Josh Levs, Catherine E. Shoichet, Jessica King and Christine Theodorou reported from Atlanta. CNN's Tina Burnside and Susanna Capelouto contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "A boat carrying approximately 950 migrants capsized in the Mediterranean Sea on Saturday, leaving many trapped inside due to locked doors, according to a survivor's account given to Italian investigators. The incident occurred around 110 kilometers north of Libya, resulting in the deaths of at least 44 people and the rescue of dozens more. The Bangladeshi migrant, who spoke to investigators after being airlifted to a hospital in Catania, Italy, described the boat as multilevel and overcrowded with passengers from various countries, including Algeria, Egypt, Somalia, Niger, Senegal, Mali, Zambia, Bangladesh, and Ghana. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat condemned the human traffickers responsible for putting people on unseaworthy vessels and risking their lives. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres called the incident a potential genocide and urged European states to launch large-scale search-and-rescue operations with proactive patrolling near Libyan shores. Doctors Without Borders also criticized European policies and announced plans to begin its own rescue efforts. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi defended his country's response and called for a focus on eradicating human trafficking. Human Rights Watch urged the EU to act quickly and launch a genuine search-and-rescue effort.",

According to Paris prosecutor's spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, the lawsuit was filed March 27 and a preliminary investigation was opened by the prosecutor's office Wednesday. The media outlet, CNN affiliate BFMTV, is accused of endangering the lives of the hostages, who were hiding in a cold room during the attack, by broadcasting their location live during the siege. BFM in a statement Friday said one of its journalists \"mentioned only once the presence of a woman hidden inside the Hyper Cacher, on the basis of police sources on the ground.\" \"Immediately, the chief editor felt that this information should not be released. It therefore has subsequently never been repeated on air or posted on-screen. BFMTV regrets that the mention of this information could cause concern to the hostages, as well as their relatives, that their lives were in danger,\" the statement said. Gunman Amedy Coulibaly, also suspected in the slaying of a police officer, stormed the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket on January 9, killing four people and taking others hostage. He was killed in the police operation to end the siege. A 24-year-old supermarket employee, Malian-born Lassana Bathily, was hailed as a hero afterward when it emerged that he had risked his life to hide 15 customers from Coulibaly in the cold room. The hostage-taking was the culmination of three days of terror in Paris that began with the January 7 shooting of 12 people at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The two brothers blamed for that attack, Cherif and Said Kouachi, were killed on January 9 after a violent standoff at an industrial site. The terror attacks claimed the lives of 17 people and put France on a heightened state of alert. CNN's Ariana Williams reported from Paris, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. CNN's Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nOn Thursday, President Barack Obama revealed that a U.S. drone strike had killed Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto, two aid workers held hostage on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Al Qaeda had sought to trade the two for prisoners held by the United States and an end to drone strikes. But it is not only terrorist groups that try to reap reward from the taking of hostages -- take the case of Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief. On April 20, just two days before diplomats resumed talks in Vienna, Austria, to reach a final agreement over Iran's nuclear program, Rezaian's Iranian attorney announced that his client had been charged with espionage, conducting propaganda, collaborating with foreign governments and collecting information \"with malicious intent.\" The State Department, Rezaian's employers at The Washington Post and fellow journalists reacted with outrage. Their anger is justified, but the decision should surprise no one: There is a long history of rogue regimes seizing hostages against the backdrop of diplomacy to extract concessions, humiliate the United States or signal unease. The scale of Iran's current hostage-taking -- not only Rezaian but also Iranian-Americans Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati -- may pale in comparison with Iranian behavior of decades past. But the use of hostages to extract concessions or dampen the enthusiasm surrounding reconciliation is part of a consistent pattern. Consider the original Iran hostage seizure: On November 4, 1979, radical students seized the American Embassy in Tehran, ultimately holding 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days. Often forgotten was what sparked that episode, which occurred more than nine months after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini declared the Islamic revolution victorious. The problem was a rush to reconcile: At a November 1, 1979, Algiers reception, Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, met Iranian Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan. According to Brzezinski's own memoir, he told Bazargan that the United States was open to any relationship the Islamic republic wanted. Photos of their handshake graced newspapers around the world. Iranian hardliners, meanwhile, were apoplectic that Barzagan was \"betraying\" Iran's revolutionary principles, and seized the embassy to block any rapprochement. Khomeini endorsed their action. \"Our young people must foil these plots,\" he reportedly said. The hostages became pawns in an escalating series of demands. Brzezinski's dream of reconciliation became a nightmare. Iran released the embassy hostages as Ronald Reagan took his oath of office, ending its first but not last hostage-taking episode. Iranian proxies seized a number of Americans in Lebanon. Reagan blessed a plan to trade arms for hostages. Putting aside the illegalities of diverting weaponry to the Nicaraguan Contras, the genesis of the scheme was not only a desire for diplomacy but also, much as with Obama's outreach today, to solidify the moderate camp within the Iranian political spectrum. Initially, the scheme worked, but no sooner had American officials delivered the last load of military equipment and the last hostages set free, then kidnappers seized three more Americans. Hostage-taking had simply become another way to collect concessions. Of course, Iran is not alone in such games. Whenever the United States tries to use diplomacy to bring rogue regimes in from the cold, it faces hostage crises. Take North Korea: Obama campaigned as the anti-Bush on the world stage. \"The notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them ... is ridiculous,\" Obama, then a senator, declared in July 2007. Obama hadn't even marked two months in office when North Korea detained two journalists working for Al Gore's Current TV. A kangaroo court sentenced Laura Ling and Euna Lee to 12 years in prison. It was traditional hostage diplomacy. Former President Bill Clinton traveled to Pyongyang to appeal for their release. North Korean leader Kim Jong Il used the episode to solidify the position of his third son and designated successor, Kim Jong Un. North Korea's police force put out word that \"General Kim Jong Un's artifice let former U.S. President Clinton cross the Pacific to apologize to the Great Leader. It was all made possible thanks to General Kim Jong Un's extraordinary prophecy and outstanding tactics.\" North Korea's deputy foreign minister confided that the groundwork for the episode had been planned long in advance. Ling and Lee were neither the first nor the last Americans that North Korea seized during the Obama era. After North Korea torpedoed a South Korean ship, killing 46, Obama sought North Korea's censure in the U.N. Security Council. Pyongyang responded by threatening Aijalon Mahli Gomes, an American imprisoned earlier that year for illegally entering North Korea. On cue, former President Jimmy Carter arrived to mediate for Gomes' release, called for new talks and, by omission, derailed efforts to hold North Korea accountable for its killing of nearly four dozen South Korean sailors. The pattern would repeat in 2012 when North Korea seized Kenneth Bae, an American whom Kim Jong Un sought to leverage into concessions. The following year, North Korea arrested an 85-year-old Korean War veteran touring the hermit kingdom and, the next year, took two other tourists hostage. Each arrest resulted in a high-level visit, an apology to North Korea that bolstered the dear leader's claims of strength and renewed engagement. Saddam Hussein likewise worked from the same playbook. In March 1995, Iraqi security forces seized two American defense contractors who strayed into Iraq from Kuwait. Sentenced to eight years, they served 114 days before Rep. Bill Richardson, D-New Mexico, a close Clinton ally (and future Cabinet-level U.N. ambassador) flew to Baghdad to retrieve them. The American media lauded Richardson, but his trip was not without cost: Saddam used it to depict Iraq as strong and America as weak. \"President Saddam Hussein ... accepts the pleas by Bill Clinton, the Congress and American people,\" the Iraqi News Agency reported. And so did the Taliban. Fifteen years before Obama traded alleged American deserter Bowe Bergdahl for five high-value Taliban and alleged al Qaeda operatives imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, the Taliban arrested two Americans female missionaries. Their detention -- and threatened death sentence -- came against the backdrop of Clinton-era attempts to negotiate with and perhaps even normalize relations with the Taliban; the Taliban, too, knew how holding Americans captive could even the playing field or even represent leverage for new concessions. So what does Iran's hostage brinkmanship portend? Diplomats drink their own Kool-Aid, and convince themselves that their engagement can bring rogues in from the cold. Ego, ambition and arrogance convince presidents that the failure of past diplomacy rests with their predecessors rather than adversaries. Hostages such as Rezaian are canaries in the coal mine, however. Their captivity -- not suave officials and their smooth promises -- show both the true character of the regime and its disregard for the norms of diplomacy.\n\noutput:",

A smuggler in the Libyan capital of Tripoli laid bare the system for loading boats with poor and desperate refugees, during a conversation that a CNN producer secretly filmed. The conversation, recorded using a mobile phone, exposes the prices and incentives used to gather as many migrants as possible onto ships. An estimated 1,600 migrants have died so far this year on the dangerous Mediterranean crossing, but still more wait to try to reach Europe. CNN's producer was introduced to a Senegalese and Malian smuggler by an intermediary in Tripoli, who mistakenly thought she was a Syrian looking to bring other Syrian refugees with her onto boats to Italy. Why I fled: Migrants share their stories. The smuggler took her to an unfinished building on the outskirts of Tripoli near the city's many ports, where the migrants they have already found are kept until the crossing is ready. The building could only be reached by walking down a trash-littered alleyway, and featured a series of packed rooms, separated by curtains, where dozens sat -- well over the 80 migrants she was promised would be in her boat. The smuggler explained that the \"final price\" for Syrians -- often thought to be richer than their African migrant counterparts -- was $1,000. He added that for each Syrian she brought with her, the producer would get a $100 discount. So if she brought 10, she could travel free. He explained how the \"discount\" was \"well known,\" suggesting perhaps it was part of the unwritten rules that govern the trade and why so many migrants come to each boat. Any fears about the crossing were supposed to be allayed by the smuggler insisting the boats they used had new motors, and that the Senegalese pilot would have a satellite telephone and GPS to assist the crossing. He also assured CNN's producer, when asked, that if the people became too many, they would use two boats. Pregnant women among migrants trying to cross.\n\noutput:",

Machete-wielding attackers hacking immigrants to death in major cities in South Africa. As attacks against foreigners and their businesses rage on, killing at least six people this week, other nations in the continent are scrambling to evacuate their citizens from South Africa.  But this is not the first time xenophobic violence has exploded in a country that  tries to portray itself as a diverse \"rainbow\" nation. They started after Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini said at a recent gathering that foreigners \"should pack their bags and go\" because they are taking jobs from citizens, local media reported. Shortly after his comments, violence against immigrants erupted in the port city of Durban. His office has denied he made the comments, saying  journalists misquoted him. While kings are mostly ceremonial figures in the nation, they are influential in their communities. But the United Nations said the attacks started in March after a labor dispute between citizens and foreign workers. Some citizens have accused African immigrants of taking their already scarce jobs, undermining businesses owned by locals and contributing to a high crime rate.  The nation's unemployment rate is about 25%, according to government figures. But resentment over porous borders, growing crime rates, poverty and corruption are also a major concern, analysts say. President Jacob Zuma has said his government is addressing the social and economic concerns. But he said immigrants contribute to the nation's economy and bring skills that are in demand, and should not be stereotyped as criminals. \"While some foreign nationals have been arrested for various crimes, it is misleading and wrong to label or regard all foreign nationals as being involved in crime in the country,\" Zuma said. The nation has about 2 million documented and undocumented immigrants, which is about 4% of the total population, according to a study by the University of the Witwatersrand. Zimbabweans make  up the largest  group of immigrants. Also, South Africa is a top travel destination for wealthy Africans because of its proximity and developed infrastructure. Yes. This is the latest in a series of attacks that date back years. In January, looters burned businesses owned by foreigners in another wave of xenophobic attacks. In addition, there were other incidents of violence last year, Human Rights Watch said. Seven years ago, Johannesburg was the epicenter of more anti-immigrant tensions that left dozens dead in attacks that later spread to Cape Town. Most of the victims were Zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances. In those attacks, police arrested more than 200 people on various charges, including rape, murder, robbery and theft. In 2006, xenophobic violence broke out again for several months in Cape Town. Victims of xenophobic attacks have been from various African nations, including Nigeria, Somalia and Ethiopia. African nations have condemned the attacks. Kenya, Malawi and Zimbabwe are just a few of the countries evacuating their citizens from South Africa. In Zambia, local radio station QFM said it will not play South African music in solidarity with the victims. And in Mozambique, South African energy and chemical giant Sasol sent about 340 South African nationals home. The company said Mozambican employees voiced concern about reported violence against their nationals and protested the presence of South African employees in Mozambique. Most of the attacks have erupted in poor and marginalized areas. Despite the progress the nation has made since its apartheid days, inequality still remains a major concern, according to the Nelson Mandela Foundation. \"It is up to the present and next generations to take up the cudgels where you (Mandela) have left off. It is up to them, through service to deepen our democracy; entrench and defend our constitution; eradicate poverty; eliminate inequality; fight corruption, and serve always with compassion, respect, integrity and tolerance,\" the foundation said in a statement. \"Xenophobia, racism and sexism must be fought with tenacity, wisdom and enlightenment.\" As fears of more attacks grow, South Africans have taken to social media and the streets to protest xenophobia and violence.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "Xenophobic attacks in South Africa have resulted in the looting and burning of shops and the deaths of at least six people this week. Foreigners, mostly from other African countries, are hiding in police stations and stadiums as machete-wielding attackers target them in major cities. The violence follows comments by Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, who reportedly urged foreigners to leave the country due to job competition. However, his office denies he made such remarks. Previous attacks against immigrants have occurred in 2006, 2006, 2008, and 2015, with the latest wave starting in March due to a labor dispute. Unemployment, porous borders, crime, poverty, and corruption are major concerns fueling the attacks. President Jacob Zuma has condemned the violence and urged against stereotyping immigrants as criminals. The UN and various African nations have condemned the attacks and are evacuating their citizens. South Africa has about 2 million documented and undocumented immigrants, with Zimbabweans making up the largest group. Despite progress since apartheid, inequality remains a significant issue, and the Nelson Mandela Foundation urges continued efforts to deepen democracy, eradicate poverty, eliminate inequality, fight corruption, and promote compassion, respect, integrity, and tolerance.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nWashington (CNN)Judge Jeffrey Sutton doesn't have a lot of company on the appeals courts these days. Sutton, who sits on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, penned the only recent appellate court decision to uphold state bans on same-sex marriage. His opinion, issued in November, goes up against an avalanche of judicial rulings striking down such bans. The split helped pave the way for the U.S. Supreme Court to take up a case on Tuesday that could ultimately decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have a constitutional right to marry. And it provides important insight into the legal arguments that could be made before the court by states seeking to uphold bans at a time when the national sentiment is quickly shifting in favor of same-sex marriage. \"It's an ideal piece of judicial craftsmanship,\" said Ryan T. Anderson of the Heritage Foundation, who believes that state bans on same-sex marriage are constitutional. Sutton \"more or less takes each and every argument that the other side has made, and then one by one by one, he explains why it doesn't work.\" Critics call the opinion an outlier and don't believe it will carry much weight, considering the number of courts that have overturned same-sex marriage bans in the nearly two years since the Supreme Court struck down the core of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. \"Judge Sutton's opinion stands alone,\" said Jon W. Davidson, legal director of Lambda Legal, a gay rights advocacy group. Sutton, 54, is the former state solicitor for Ohio, where he handled appeals for the state's attorney general. He clerked for Justices Antonin Scalia and Lewis Powell -- Scalia once called Sutton \"one of the very best law clerks I ever had.\" Appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, Sutton is considered a conservative jurist with a keen interest in states' rights. Here are the central arguments from his opinion that states seeking to uphold their same-sex marriage bans are expected to echo on Tuesday. It is \"dangerous and demeaning,\" Sutton wrote, to the citizenry to assume that only judges \"can fairly understand\" the arguments for and against same-sex marriage. \"Isn't the goal to create a culture in which a majority of citizens dignify and respect the rights of minority groups?\" he asked in the opinion joined by Judge Deborah L. Cook, also a Bush appointee. Critics such as Davidson have roundly condemned such reasoning. \"The people don't get to decide what the Constitution safeguards,\" Davidson said. \"They don't get to vote to violate the Constitution.\" Sutton pointed  to the drafters and their views of the 14th Amendment. \"Nobody in this case,\" he wrote, \"argues that the people who adopted the Fourteenth Amendment understood it to require the States to change the definition of marriage.\" It's an argument made to enforce the idea that there is no fundamental right to marriage for same-sex couples in the Constitution. \"From the founding of the Republic to 2003, every state defined marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman,\" he wrote, noting that the \"Fourteenth Amendment permits, though does not require, States to define marriage that way.\" He said that the same-sex marriage bans rationally advance a legitimate government policy. \"By creating a status (marriage) and by subsidizing it (e.g. with tax-filing privileges and deductions), the States created an incentive for two people who procreate together to stay together for purposes of rearing offspring.\" He said that states should not be accused of \"irrationality,\" but only the awareness that same-sex couples don't have children in the same way as couples of the opposite sex. Sutton pushes back on any suggestion that those who oppose same-sex marriage have negative feelings about gay and lesbian couples. He said that ballot initiatives banning same sex-marriage were not driven by hostility but were passed by \"real people who teach our children, create our jobs, and defend our shores.\" Gene Schaerr, a Washington appellate lawyer who help to defend Utah's ban on same-sex marriage, calls Sutton's opinion a road map for whoever might write an opinion supporting state bans. \"He's very much willing both in the result and in his analysis to leave the issue to the people without suggesting an answer one way or another,\" Schaerr said. But attached to Sutton's opinion was a harsh dissent from a third member of the three-judge panel that heard the case in the 6th Circuit. Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey, a Bill Clinton appointee, dismissed the opinion as an \"engrossing TED talk\" and a \"largely irrelevant discourse on democracy and federalism.\" Daughtrey said that Sutton failed to see the plaintiffs as individuals \"suffering actual harm.\" \"These plaintiffs are not political zealots trying to push reform on their fellow citizens, \" she wrote, but committed same-sex couples seeking equal status. Her harshest language was for Sutton's premise that the decision should be left to the democratic process. \"If we in the judiciary do not have the authority, and indeed the responsibility, to right fundamental wrongs left excused by a majority of the electorate, our whole intricate, constitutional system of checks and balances, as well as the oaths to which we swore, prove to be nothing but shams.\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nThe death of Freddie Gray, which was the flashpoint for the protests and now the riots in Baltimore, has raised again the questions surrounding  police use of force, especially after the now-familiar video of officers arresting Mr. Gray and loading him into a police van. Gray was arrested by police on April 12. The 25-year-old was carried in the van for 40 minutes and he was not properly buckled in, according to authorities. Gray's family said his voice box had been crushed and his neck snapped, and after a week of hospitalization, he died. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts has said, \"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\" The police and the U.S. Justice Department are investigating. The case raises at least three legal issues:. Believe it or not, the charging document in this case gives us more information than the now-viral video of the arrest.In that narrative, police state \"Defendant fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence.\" According to the officers' words, that's the sole reason a stop was initiated. There is no other description of either criminal activity or safety concerns.  The next sentence is important too: \"The defendant was apprehended in [a specific location] after a brief foot chase.\"  The police are locked in: it appears that by their own narrative that the unprovoked flight was the only reason for the stop, because the very next thing that happens...is the stop. Can the police stop you if all you do is run from them when you see them? For the most part, yes. But having grounds to stop is not the same as having probable cause to make an arrest. In this case, Mr. Gray took off running. The United States Supreme Court and Maryland courts have made clear that unprovoked flight -- running away from the police for no reason -- is enough to support reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. When you add to the suspect's flight the Supreme Court's recognition that the character of the neighborhood is also a factor in assessing reasonable suspicion, it appears that the police in this case had at least enough to justify the stop, constitutionally. Much to the chagrin of public defenders and defense attorneys, as long as an officer testifies minimally to an individual (1) running away, (2) in a \"high crime\" area, the stop will usually be \"good.\" But police are supposed to articulate the additional safety concern to get to the frisk. Police must also have reasonable suspicion that the suspect may be \"armed and presently dangerous\" to additionally conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing for the sole purpose of discovering weapons. The charging document doesn't really identify a safety concern ... or does it? After the chase, and before an arrest: \"This officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket.\" Shouldn't that really say: \"I saw a clip but whatever it was clipped to was inside a pocket ... where I couldn't see it\"? That's a close call: Police were lawfully at the stop stage, but the knife -- even though it was inside his pants pocket -- was visible from the outside ... because of an identifying knife clip? See how artfully that was done? Observation of a knife is definitely a safety concern. Observation of a clip? I suppose that will get the officer to the frisk of the pocket ... assuming he is a connoisseur of knife clips and can differentiate them from hair clips, chip clips, etc. According to William Murphy, an attorney for Gray's family, he was carrying a \"pocket knife of legal size,\" and the lawyer contended that police didn't see the knife before the altercation. The legality of the knife will be an issue, but police have essentially conceded that the knife was not seen until the stop. The important thing here is that a stop and frisk is not the same as an arrest. In theory, if a stop gives rise to no suspicion, and a frisk yields nothing more than a comb and some pocket lint, the citizen should be free to leave. An arrest requires much more: probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, and nothing less. That knife was the only crime he was charged with, so again, police are locked into a narrative by their own report. If it ultimately turns out to be a legal knife, there will be a lot of scrutiny on the decision to arrest. For example, if the \"knife\" was one of those pointy files attached to a 2-inch nail clipper, that does not sound like good faith probable cause for an arrest. Remember also that based on the police narrative in the report, they did not see the knife until after they seized Mr. Gray. So the question arises: What would they have done with Gray if he had no knife or other contraband on him? They could, but most likely not unless there was some intentional act that resulted in Gray's death. As we've seen, charging officers with crimes -- especially murder -- is rare and difficult. If you're pro-cop, you could say that's because they are well-trained and rarely abuse their force. If you have a more jaded view of law enforcement, you would say it's because they are well-trained, and consequently very skilled at testifying or explaining their use of force. Baltimore Police are suggesting Mr. Gray's injuries occurred after his arrest, while he was being transported back for processing, and that he may not have received proper medical attention. That's not a surprise. In fact, from a liability perspective, this is a good strategic move for the police. It will be harder to hold them liable if Gray's injuries happened after -- not before -- his arrest. Pre-arrest, Gray's \"seizure\" would be judged by a \"reasonableness\" standard, under the Fourth Amendment. However, courts have limited these \"seizures\" to the initial act of seizing the person. Any excessive force claims after the arrest are not covered by the Fourth Amendment. The claims of an arrestee are instead governed by a different constitutional provision: the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. So what? What's the difference between the Fourth and 14th Amendment anyway? When it comes to potential civil liability of the officers, it makes a huge difference. The applicable burden of proof and chances of winning a lawsuit depend largely on which constitutional standard governs. Under the Fourth Amendment, the test is whether the force was objectively unreasonable based on the totality of the circumstances. Under the 14th Amendment standard, the officer will only be liable if the force was applied maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering. That's a much tougher burden for a plaintiff to meet. Fortunately, courts have held that pretrial detainees like Freddie Gray are entitled to at least the same protection under the 14th Amendment as are convicted prisoners under the Eighth Amendment, and its prohibition against \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" in this case the deliberate indifference to medical needs of prisoners. Confused? You're not alone. Even a Supreme Court justice has taken issue with this view of the Constitution. Other jurisdictions have actually opted to extend the protections of the Fourth Amendment after arrest, so not only could reasonable minds differ ... reasonable courts, judges, and states differ, too. It's just that Maryland is not within one of those jurisdictions. But it's true. It's a kind of unintentional \"gap\" in constitutional coverage, one the courts have struggled to deal with. Based on the law, it seems that if an arrestee is hurt during a \"rough ride,\" police might avoid liability in Maryland if they contend the injury was not caused wantonly or sadistically. That's a higher standard for liability than if Freddie Gray was hurt pre-arrest, so, if it's the truth, it just happens to also be a constitutionally convenient one.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The death of Freddie Gray, who was arrested by Baltimore police on April 12, 2015, and later died after being transported in a police van, has raised questions regarding police use of force and the legality of his arrest. Gray's family claims his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped during the arrest, while authorities say he was not properly buckled in the van and received no medical attention in a timely manner. The police and U.S. Justice Department are investigating the incident.\n\nThe charging document in the case states that Gray \"fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence,\" justifying the initial stop. However, the question of whether police can stop an individual solely for running away is a complex legal issue. The Supreme Court and Maryland courts have ruled that unprovoked flight can provide reasonable suspicion for a stop, but not necessarily for an arrest.\n\nThe charging document also mentions the observation of a knife clipped to Gray's pants pocket, which could potentially justify a frisk for weapons. However, the legality of the knife and the timing of its discovery are points of contention.\n\nThe incident raises several legal issues, including the reasonableness of the stop and the application of the Fourth and 14th Amendments to pre-arrest detainees. If it is determined that Gray's injuries occurred after his arrest, the police may have a stronger",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nMonty Python in a movie? What a silly idea. But the timing was right for the gang of British comedians (along with their token American, Terry Gilliam), who were looking to hit the big screen after four seasons of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus,\" their groundbreaking British TV series. \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\" which premiered 40 years ago Thursday, was the result. The movie, a spoof of the Arthurian legend, did not start auspiciously. The budget was small -- about $400,000, half of it supplied by rock stars, including Genesis and Pink Floyd. On the first day of filming in Scotland -- the first shot, in fact -- the camera broke. The weather was bad. The hotel was dismal. Python member Graham Chapman was suffering from alcohol withdrawal. It got better. On the day of its first American screening in New York, a thousand people were in line by 8 a.m. Thanks to the popularity of \"Python\" on American TV, the movie was a box-office hit, making $5 million -- more than 10 times its budget. More importantly, it soon became a comedy classic. The dialogue alone has been widely quoted, with such lines as \"It's just a flesh wound\" and \"Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries\" referenced on shows such as \"The Simpsons,\" \"Game of Thrones\" and \"The Blacklist.\"  Python member Eric Idle turned the film into the Tony-winning Broadway play \"Spamalot.\" The troupe ended up making three movies -- well, four, if you count \"And Now for Something Completely Different,\" five if you include \"Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl,\" five-and-a-half if you allow \"The Rutles,\" six if you ... well, three. We'll say three. Is there a best one? Where should you start? Let's break them down:. From its dramatic opening credits featuring fake-Swedish subtitles to the adventures of Sir Launcelot (\"the boldest and most expensive of the knights\"), weighted-bird computations and sudden animator heart attacks, \"Holy Grail\" is probably the loosest and most Python-esque of the Python oeuvre. As a movie with a plot and character and all that movie nonsense, it falls short -- but as a repository for some of Python's best gags, it remains perhaps the best (and certainly most quotable) of the bunch. Besides, it features the word \"shrubbery.\" \" 'Grail' is a bit like 'A Hard Day's Night,' \" Idle observed in the Pythons' autobiography. \"It's got a joie de vivre that's very infectious, it's very hard not to like.\" Pros: The dialogue. The Black Knight. The Knights Who Say \"Ni.\" Cons: It's sometimes sloppy. And it doesn't really have an ending. Verdict: Better than a cheese shop full of ex-parrots. Probably Python's most consistent movie, \"Life of Brian\" is the story of a guy born down the road from Jesus who finds himself hailed as a messiah and ends up crucified. It was a satire on organized religion, first-century politics and zealotry -- one of the best bits is the ongoing argument between \"the People's Front of Judea\" and \"the Judean People's Front\" -- but try telling that to the protesters. The film was picketed in cities across the United States, deplored by some religious leaders and banned in Ireland and Norway. (Sweden promoted it with the line, \"The film so funny that it was banned in Norway.\") It did have one huge supporter: ex-Beatle George Harrison, who mortgaged his estate to help fund the movie when a financier pulled out. \"He paid for it because he wanted to see it,\" Idle recalled. \"The most anybody's ever paid for a cinema ticket in history.\" Pros: Graham Chapman's performance as Brian. \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.\" Cons: The adventurous but ultimately pointless animated-alien scene. Michael Palin's lisping Pilate (though, to be fair, it's so childishly broad you can't help but laugh). Verdict: Funnier than the Spanish Inquisition. \"Meaning of Life,\" constructed as a series of sketches, is the most uneven of the three narrative Python films. After the stunning opening sequence, Gilliam's \"The Crimson Permanent Assurance\" -- about the revenge of some pirate-like accountants -- the film struggles to find its footing. Even the Pythons thought so. \"The rhythms weren't right,\" said Gilliam. \"It needed a whole other rewrite,\" said Idle. Nevertheless, it has its moments: the \"Every Sperm Is Sacred\" sequence, about religion, sex and contraception; the organ donor who's surprised by a demand for his liver; and -- of course -- the infamous Mr. Creosote, the absurdly fat man who gorges on a monstrous meal at a posh restaurant, regurgitates it at length, and is then encouraged to have a \"wafer-thin\" after-dinner mint -- with disastrous results. It also has the sweetest of all Python songs: Idle's \"The Galaxy Song,\" which is even more uplifting than \"Brian's\" \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.\" Not a bad conclusion, given what happened to Mr. Creosote. Pros: \"Permanent Assurance.\" Mr. Creosote. \"The Galaxy Song.\" Cons: The fish. The schoolmaster's sex lesson. The fish. Verdict: More enjoyable than watching the Upper-Class Twit of the Year competition.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nOver the last few years, we've been close to eradicating worldwide polio without full success. However, a new medical technology, an easily applied microneedle patch, could be the key to that goal. The biggest challenge standing in the way of eradicating polio has involved the operational logistics of getting the vaccine to people who need it, especially in difficult areas plagued by violence or poverty. The microneedle patch, which resembles a small, round adhesive bandage, could bring polio vaccines to the doorsteps of the people that need it. By applying it to the skin and pushing down, the vaccine is delivered in a matter of minutes. Rather than requiring highly trained medics, minimally trained personnel could go from door to door, quickly administering the vaccine. It's been 60 years since a mass inoculation of Jonas Salk's vaccine began with school children in April, 1955 that caused polio cases in the United States to drop by almost 90% over the course of two years. The vaccine was eagerly awaited because, according to the CDC, about 35,000 people annually became disabled because of polio in the U.S. in the 1940s and '50s. In 1938, Roosevelt founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, an organization known today as the March of Dimes Foundation, to fight polio. The organization funded the two vaccines -- one created by Salk and another by Albert Sabin -- that would lead to the protection of most of the world against polio. Salk's vaccine, developed in the 1950s, involved injecting a virus that was \"killed,\" while Sabin's vaccine -- which he worked on in the 1960s and which was administered orally -- contained a weakened version of polio. The Sabin vaccine actually helped boost immunity in communities beyond the individual because people shed the weakened virus in their feces. It came to replace the Salk vaccine in many places between 1963 and 1999, according to the Smithsonian. But the injected \"killed\" virus version is what's given in the United States today because of the rare instances of people developing polio from the oral vaccine. Most people with polio have no symptoms; minor symptoms such as limb pain, fatigue and nausea affect about 4% to 8% of patients, according to the CDC. Fewer than 1% of cases lead to patients becoming permanently paralyzed, usually in the legs. Between 5% and 10% of paralyzed patients die when their respiratory muscles become paralyzed, too. Human beings have been living with polio for thousands of years, Dr. Stephen Cochi, a polio specialist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said. There's evidence from ancient Egypt that paralytic polio existed there and even infected royalty. But it wasn't described clinically until 1789. The United States saw its first polio outbreak in 1894 in Vermont, with 132 cases, according to the Smithsonian. As the population became more urbanized in the early 20th century, more outbreaks occurred. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt contracted the disease at age 39 in 1921. Although no cure was developed, a device called an iron lung was invented to help people with the disease breathe. The patient would lie on a bed inside a cylindrical tank, and the machine helped some people become able to breathe again on their own. This device cost about $1,500 in the 1930s -- about what a home would cost then, according to the Smithsonian. That is, until the vaccine came on the scene. Polio was declared eradicated in the United States in 1979. But the vaccination effort doesn't stop. \"In the U.S., where there's no problem anymore, we still want to have the population protected,\" said Michael Katz, senior advisor and interim medical director of the March of Dimes. Children should receive four doses of inactivated polio vaccine, delivered as an injection, at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years, according to the CDC. Most American adults were vaccinated as children and don't need another dose. But people may need additional protection if they are traveling to high-risk countries, handle poliovirus specimens in a laboratory or have close contact with a person who has polio. Polio primarily spreads from person to person -- through coughing and sneezing -- or through fecal contamination. The particles are large enough that the risk of contracting polio in the air is momentary, and on a surface like a desk or a chair, it can last an hour or two. But in sewage, it can last for weeks or even months. Polio is the next likely candidate for disease eradication, Cochi said. The only infectious disease that humans have eradicated is smallpox. Like polio, it was a viral disease spread from person to person and would infect everyone in the absence of vaccination. And there's no non-human animal in nature that hosts these viruses, making it easier to eradicate than a disease that animals carry, too (although at least 100,000 monkeys were killed in the development of polio vaccines in the mid-20th century, according to the Smithsonian). A big difference, though, is that smallpox has obvious characteristic symptoms: fever and rash. Most people with polio have no symptoms at all, or very mild symptoms. On average, one out of 200 patients experiences paralysis. For polio, tremendous progress is being made, with 95% of children being reached for the most part, Oliver Rosenbauer, spokesman for polio efforts at the WHO, said. But there are still districts where only 75% to 80% of children are covered, which allows the virus to continue circulating in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. \"The virus keeps getting increasingly restricted,\" Rosenbauer said. \"We're not there, but I think the trend is good.\" Perhaps microneedles could be the key to finally eradicate worldwide polio.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The microneedle patch, a new medical technology, could be the solution to finally eradicating polio worldwide. This easily applied vaccine delivery system resembles a small adhesive bandage and can be administered by minimally trained personnel, making it ideal for reaching people in difficult areas. Polio, a viral disease that has affected humans for thousands of years, causes paralysis in fewer than 1% of cases, and about 200,000 cases were reported globally in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The biggest challenge in eradicating polio has been the operational logistics of getting the vaccine to those who need it, especially in areas with poverty or violence. The microneedle patch could change this by allowing vaccines to be brought directly to people's doorsteps. Polio was first described clinically in 1789, and the United States saw its first outbreak in 1894. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt contracted the disease in 1921, leading to the development of the iron lung and eventually the polio vaccine in the 1950s. Polio was declared eradicated in the United States in 1979, but efforts to eradicate it globally continue, with 100,000 monkeys killed in the mid",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nHillary Clinton is now officially a candidate for president -- and the never ending Clinton story rumbles on. She has been a part of all our lives now for approaching a quarter of a century. She started as the first lady that the right loved to hate, then the deceived wife, next a senator, then a candidate for president in one of the most dynamic primaries in history and finally, a secretary of state. The Republicans have their aristocratic Bushes, the Democrats have their Clintons. And if Hillary or Jeb were to win two presidential terms, then in the 44 years from 1981 to 2025, 28 will have had a Clinton or a Bush in the White House. The great American republic now looks about as democratic as \"Game of Thrones.\" But even though Hillary Clinton has been around nearly my entire lifetime, The Economist may speak for many when it asks: \"What does Hillary stand for?\" There is a paradox she presents: She is by far the best-known presidential candidate across both parties and, for the moment, almost unchallenged within her own. Yet even though Diane Feinstein can assert confidently that Hillary \"doesn't 'need' (the White House). But she wants it\" -- the question unanswered is \"What for?\" And for liberals, who believe that government is there to do something, it's this lack of definition that is surely so disconcerting about Clinton. There are good grounds for a liberal primary challenge to Clinton. The economy has revived under Obama but, say critics, largely to the benefit of Wall Street and the super-rich. The riots in Ferguson, Missouri, were a painful reminder that the poor, particularly the nonwhite poor, have been left behind. Clinton's credentials as a fighter against inequality are mixed. It is true, as the Wall Street Times notes, that she has previously called for \"universal prekindergarten, equal pay for women, increases in the minimum wage, paid family leave, higher taxes on the wealthy and an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit for working-poor families.\" But she counts among her friends precisely those corporate people blamed by the Occupy crowd for the country's inequality. Clinton is now, wisely, trying to distance herself from the Clinton Foundation -- after all, its fundraising efforts among foreign interests are hardly the stuff of populist liberalism. Then there is her foreign policy record. Clinton voted in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War (though in her memoir last year, she backed away from the vote, writing that she \"got it wrong.\") As secretary of state, she is easily associated in the mind of the left with such controversies as the war in Syria, the crisis in Libya and the collapse of the Mubarak regime in Egypt. That some of these may have had little to do with her is beside the point. Clinton is going to have to spend a sizeable amount of time during the primaries explaining and defending the things that occurred while she was working for the Obama administration. Her personal ethics are on the agenda, too -- as demonstrated by the flap over her use of a private email account. These are the issues that her Democratic rivals are running on. In Iowa last week, both Jim Webb and Martin O'Malley attacked Wall Street, Webb adding that he had also opposed the Iraq War. Both men questioned the wisdom of Clintonian triangulation -- the idea that the White House can be won, and the country successfully governed, by always seeking the middle ground. Both men would be wise to focus on Iowa; to contrast a populist, folksy campaign with the distant, over-managed style of Clinton. And both would do well to tap into a feeling that it would be unhealthy, undemocratic and plain dull to let Hillary coast to the nomination without a proper challenge. Nevertheless, there is a strange contradiction between the constant assertions that Democrats want a race and the polling evidence that Clinton would beat anyone who tried to take her on. Why do liberals demand a conversation about policy if the only answer they can still come up with is Hillary? The explanation is that the Democratic Party is intellectually impoverished. We hear often of the GOP's problems, how out of touch with a changing electorate it is and how it is divided against itself. The Democrats' challenges, however, are just as substantial. They've just been masked by having a charismatic man in the White House dominating the national conversation. Obama was elected at one of the highest points of national Democratic popularity. But, since then, Democratic power has been whittled away in successive congressional and local elections -- leaving the party without significant representation in the Deep South and absent any mildly conservative support at all. Everything was staked on Obamacare, which was ambitious and noble venture but without an obvious second act to follow. Democrats have become about defending the honor and reputation of their president rather than proposing bold new reforms. And the mood of their base can be felt either in the violence in Missouri or the disaffected, hollow laughter of \"The Daily Show\" audience. Cynicism abounds. Who really imagines that Hillary Clinton is the kind of personality that can spark a renaissance of thinking or a rejuvenation of activism among liberals? To repeat the question: what is she exactly running for? If she has one trump card to play, however, it is reinvention. Recall that she started the 2008 primaries out as a moderate, play-it-safe frontrunner and ended them drinking beer in an Indiana bar -- reinvented, in the words of Barack Obama, as Annie Oakley. If there is little intellectualism left in liberalism, at least Hillary Clinton is clever. Which is why she remains an asset to her party.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "Hillary Clinton has officially announced her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election, making her the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. With a political career spanning over two decades, Clinton has been a first lady, a senator, a presidential candidate, and a secretary of state. The Economist raises the question of what Clinton stands for, as she is both well-known and unchallenged within her party. Critics argue that her record on economic inequality is mixed, and her foreign policy decisions, such as her vote for the Iraq War and her tenure as secretary of state, have left some on the left questioning her credentials. Additionally, her use of a private email account during her time as secretary of state has become a point of controversy. Democratic rivals Jim Webb and Martin O'Malley have attacked Clinton's record on Wall Street and her foreign policy, and have called for a more populist, folksy campaign. However, polls show that Clinton would beat any potential challenger, leaving some wondering why there is a demand for a conversation about policy if the answer is always Hillary. The Democratic Party is criticized for being intellectually impoverished, with little representation in the Deep South and a focus on defending Obama's honor rather than proposing new reforms. Clinton's ability to reinvent herself may be her greatest asset, as she transformed from a moderate frontrunner in 2008",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nKathmandu, Nepal (CNN)The death toll from the devastating earthquake that struck Nepal two days ago surged past 3,000 on Monday, a government official said. The desperate search for survivors from the country's worst natural disaster in more than 80 years continued. The number of people confirmed dead in Nepal stands at 3,218, said Nepalese Ministry of Home Affairs spokesman Laxmi Dhakal. India has reported 56 deaths, and China another 20. The death toll is expected to climb further as officials get information from the rugged countryside that makes up most of Nepal. As day broke Monday, Nepal was still in survival mode after suffering a series of aftershocks following the huge initial quake on Saturday. The damage was everywhere. Stunned residents wandered the streets of Kathmandu, the capital city of roughly 3 million people that's now the focus of international disaster relief efforts. People dug through piles of debris where their homes once stood, seeking pieces of their former lives and, possibly, family members. Many of the injured were treated outside overflowing hospitals, where crowds of people gathered looking for relatives. Dhakal, the government spokesman, said Monday 6,525 people were reported to have been injured. One video aired on Nepal State Television captured a rare bright moment amid the death and devastation. It shows uniformed officers digging though rubble, desperately trying to free a man who is hurt but alive. Rescuers lift him up, and cheers of joy erupt from the crowd. The clip shows him being put on a stretcher and carried to safety. But often, searchers have found bodies rather than survivors. And the odds of saving the living decrease as the crucial first 72 hours tick by. The earthquake and its aftershocks have turned one of the world's most scenic regions into a panorama of devastation. \"The journey towards my family home in Sitapaila was a map of quake destruction, with many houses -- old and new -- torn apart,\" wrote freelance journalist Sunir Pandey. \"A high wall surrounding a monastery had collapsed and the nuns had run to a nearby field,\" he wrote. \"A mud-and-brick cottage had fallen on a blue motorbike but no trace could be found of its rider. Everywhere, survivors gathered wherever they could find open space -- fields, private compounds, empty roadside lots.\" At night, many Nepalis slept in the open, shivering in the frigid air of the Himalayan Mountains but at least safe from falling debris. \"The entire city was under darkness,\" Christina Berry of England wrote for CNN affiliate IBN from Kathmandu. \"There was not a single light anywhere. The power supply had been cut off. Our caring hotel manager gave us some food and some candles, too. Me and Alexandra were so scared. We slept in the open verandah of the hotel fearing more quakes in the night.\" Read earthquake stories from social media. CNN producer Ingrid Formanek, who arrived Sunday night, said Kathmandu \"looks like a city where buildings have been abandoned. People are hanging out in public squares and at intersections to avoid rubble from buildings.\" \"We were able to drive the main road to the hotel we're staying at, but they're not allowing anyone inside because of the aftershocks. The guests are in a big tent used for functions on the lawn. People are squeezed in. There are probably about 100 people in there,\" Formanek said. \"The tents are covered, but water is seeping in from streets puddled with water, especially around the edges of the tent.\" Residents of Kathmandu are banding together to get by, with stores shuttered and very few sources of food and drinkable water. \"Communal kitchens have been set up for cooking,\" Formanek said. \"Not by the government -- people set them up on their own.\" Many of the city's centuries-old buildings, which had stood stalwart for generations and provided a sense of national pride, have been toppled. Dozens of bodies were pulled from Dharahara, the historic nine-story tower that came crashing down during the quake. A backhoe chipped away at the nub left protruding through its crumbled ruins. When it seemed as if things couldn't get worse, a powerful aftershock jolted Nepal on Sunday, sending people screaming into the streets and causing new injuries for already traumatized residents. Climbers said it set off fresh avalanches on Mount Everest, where at least 17 people were reported to have been killed on Saturday. The magnitude of the new quake Sunday was initially estimated at 6.7 by the U.S. Geological Survey, considerably weaker than the magnitude-7.8 of the devastating one of a day earlier. Four Americans were confirmed to be among the dead. Google executive Dan Fredinburg was one of them. According to an Instagram post by his sister on his account, an avalanche killed Fredinburg on Mount Everest. Marisa Eve Girawong, who went by her middle name, of New Jersey also was killed by an avalanche on Everest. The physician's assistant was working as an Everest base camp doctor for Seattle-based Madison Mountaineering, when she was swept away to her death. Tom Taplin, a filmmaker from Santa Monica, California, was making a documentary on Everest climbers, when wind stirred by the avalanche caused him to take a fall, CNN affiliate KABC reported. Looking for missing loved ones in Nepal? CNN iReport wants to help. The mountains that define Nepal make it difficult to deliver relief, though international efforts are in full swing. Aftershocks are also complicating operations. A team of 260 emergency responders was about an hour away from departure at Israel's Ben Gurion Airport when an aftershock in Kathmandu delayed its departure. The U.S. Agency for International Development's Disaster Response Team, made up of 54 urban search and rescue specialists from Fairfax County, Virginia, and six K-9s, headed to Nepal on Sunday on a C-17 military transport plane. The dogs are trained to find signs of life in rubble after a disaster. But the trip was expected to take about 24 hours, reducing the precious hours left in which survivors are likely to be found.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nWhen drinkers in Clayton's, a beachfront bar in South Padre Island, Texas, belly up for a round of shots, bartender Casey Belue can usually guess what they'll order. It comes in a yellow-labeled bottle with a fire-breathing demon on it. It tastes like Big Red chewing gum. It's Fireball Cinnamon Whisky, and lately it's been as hot as its name. \"Fireball is number one, definitely. That's pretty much the chosen shot,\" said Belue, who enjoys it herself now and then. \"On an average night, we probably go through three or four bottles.\" If you're young -- say, under 35 -- this may not be news to you. Fireball, which didn't exist in its current form a decade ago, is the fastest-growing big brand of liquor in America. Retail sales more than doubled last year, and Fireball has come seemingly out of nowhere to become the sixth-most popular liquor brand in the U.S. as measured by retail sales -- ahead of such venerable labels as Jim Beam, Jose Cuervo and Grey Goose. And these figures don't include sales in bars, where Fireball has dethroned Jagermeister as America's party shot of choice. Or social media feeds, which fill with photos of Fireball-flavored revelry and #FireballFriday hashtags. \"Fireball is an incredible phenomenon. The growth of it has just been astounding,\" said Lew Bryson, managing editor of Whisky Advocate and author of several books on whiskey and other spirits. \"For a whiskey, this is unprecedented.\" To the uninitiated, Fireball is basically made from Canadian whisky, aged in used bourbon barrels, flavored with sweetener and spicy cinnamon. (The \"whisky\" spelling generally refers to Scotches or Canadian varieties, while \"whiskey\" refers to Irish or American styles.) Its slogan is \"Tastes like heaven, burns like hell,\" but that's an exaggeration. Fireball has a kick, but it doesn't burn as much as straight whiskeys, cheap tequilas or even the Atomic Fireball hard candy that helped inspire its name. It's also only 66 proof, or 33% alcohol -- less than most whiskeys. \"It's so easy to drink that you forget you're drinking alcohol. It's very sweet. You hardly taste the whiskey at all,\" said Zachary Jones, a bartender at Community Smith in Atlanta. \"I've known people who can't do shots, but they can do Fireball.\" Fireball is especially popular among young drinkers and women, many of whom say they like that it doesn't singe their throat and leaves a Dentyne-like aftertaste. But not everyone is a fan. Whiskey enthusiasts -- the types who can talk knowledgeably about single-malt Scotches -- mostly turn up their noses at the stuff. \"I've got to be honest: It's not anything I'd reach for, at any occasion,\" Bryson said. \"But clearly I'm not in the mainstream.\" Fireball wasn't always Fireball. It used to be known as Dr. McGillicuddy's Fireball Whisky before its maker, the Sazerac Co., rebranded it in 2006. Sales were modest until about five years ago, when Sazerac hired a \"national brand ambassador,\" Richard Pomes, to spread the word about Fireball through event planning and bartender outreach. In other words, Pomes traveled the country serving up Fireball shots in bars. He started in college towns and cities with vibrant bar cultures, such as Austin and Nashville, and then spread to other places. Everywhere he went, Pomes shared his Fireballing exploits on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and encouraged patrons to do the same. Soon, Fireball started gaining traction. Then it exploded. Retail sales jumped from just under $2 million in 2011 to $63 million in 2013 to $130 million last year, according to IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm. Along the way, Sazerac has cultivated a party-hearty social ethos around Fireball, encouraging pics of shots with hashtags such as #WhiskyWednesday. The brand has more than 85,000 followers on Twitter and another 43,000 on Instagram -- more than twice the social reach of Jagermeister -- although on Twitter, it still trails Jack Daniel's whiskey and Patron tequila. And it got a boost in October when someone taped a GoPro camera to a large bottle of the liquor and filmed dozens of guests chugging from it at a wedding reception. The resulting video has more than 2.3 million YouTube views. \"Our fans love it, and they spread the word. The Fireball nation is devoted -- and this is the best kind of marketing,\" said Amy Preske, public relations and events manager for Sazerac, who declined to offer any further explanation for the brand's booming popularity. \"We are very excited and humbled.\" So is Fireball a future cornerstone of every well-stocked bar or just a fad? It may be too soon to say. Retail sales remain strong, according to IRI, although Fireball's skyrocketing growth has slowed in recent months. But it's under siege from several fronts. The past year has brought copycats Jim Beam Kentucky Fire and Jack Daniels Tennessee Fire, both bourbon whiskeys infused with spicy cinnamon syrup, along with cinnamon vodkas, cinnamon tequilas and other cinnamon liqueurs. Fireball also endured a public-relations mess last fall when several European countries briefly recalled the liquor over concerns about one of its ingredients: propylene glycol, a chemical used in a variety of food products, e-cigarettes and antifreeze. Sazerac responded that propylene glycol exists in Fireball \"in very small quantities\" -- less than 1/8th of the amount allowed by the FDA (PDF) -- and reassured customers that Fireball is \"absolutely safe to drink.\" Then there's the question of whether Fireball will become a victim of its own success. Young consumers are notoriously fickle, and there is anecdotal evidence that some people are getting sick of it. \"It just reached a point where I couldn't drink it anymore,\" said Jones, the Atlanta bartender. \"I think it was the sugar.\" Still, its popularity remains on display nightly wherever young people gather. Glasses are raised, someone makes a toast, and down go shots of an orange, syrupy and seemingly unstoppable concoction. \"It's an easy shot. You can drink a lot of them. With Fireball, you don't need a chaser,\" said Kelvin Davis, a bartender at the Nook in Atlanta. \"It's the one thing I can throw out there and it never fails.\"\n\noutput:",

Established on the birthday of the American founding father, Liberland -- the world's newest micronation -- is founded on a firm belief in liberty and noninterference from the powers-that-be. A tiny, 7 square-kilometer parcel of land, marked on maps as Gornja Siga, its territory abuts the Danube on the border between Serbia and Croatia. The victim of a border dispute between Serbia and Croatia, it is claimed by neither side -- effectively a no-man's land. No one lives on this patch of land, which is heavily forested and contains only badly-maintained access roads and a run-down house, abandoned for decades. This is where Euroskeptic Czech politician Vit Jedlicka stepped in. On April 13 he planted his newly-designed yellow and black flag in the territory, declaring the area the Free Republic of Liberland -- a tiny sliver of a country, bigger only than the Vatican and Monaco. He tells CNN that the country will be formally founded on May 1 and is inviting, through the media, the world's heads of state to attend a formal ceremony marking the presumptive nation's birth. He says that he will also invite 7,500 of the 300,000 applicants that applied to become citizens of Liberland to the ceremony, where he will grant them citizenship. \"I will grant citizenship if they can make it to the party,\" he told CNN by phone. \"It's short notice but a good challenge, and also for  the presidents (and other heads of state) if they can make it to the founding of our country.\" Jedlicka, an active member of the Czech Republic's Party of Free Citizens, opposes excessive government interference. He says his attempts to enact change in his home country led him to the political experiment that is Liberland. \"I would describe it as a global revolution. It's just the beginning,\" he tells CNN via Skype. Founded on staunchly libertarian principles -- its motto is \"To live and let live\" -- its website describes its system of governance as being a \"constitutional republic with elements of direct democracy.\" It will use a form of cryptocurrency -- similar to Bitcoin -- as its national currency, bypassing the need for a central bank and will, according to its constitution, keep government's noses out of everything possible, from the banks to prostitution. \"Liberland prides itself on personal and economic freedom of its people, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, which significantly limits the power of politicians so they could not interfere too much in the freedoms of the Liberland nation,\" the world's newest constitutional document states. Financial regulation will be minimal, if at all present. Jedlicka says almost 300,000 applications for citizenship have been received, about 20 of which have been accepted. \"Thousands of Americans, Swiss people. Also a lot of Arabic peoples who feel oppressed by the regimes there.\" He envisions, ultimately, a community of around 35,000 Liberlanders, not all of whom will be full-time residents. He says he expects trouble from his neighbors, whose land he has effectively annexed. \"From Serbia, Croatia, we expect some trouble but we expect international laws will applied and any movement against us would be an attack on a sovereign nation, and we will offer nothing but passive resistance. For now, (though) we will make roads, docks.\" For its part, the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement to CNN that stated that Liberland would not theoretically impinge upon its border, which is delineated by the Danube, but \"the Ministry also considers this a frivolous act which needs no further comment.\" Croatia's counterpart was similarly dismissive. \"Virtual quips, however interesting they occasionally sound, remain what they are -- virtual quips, and for them we have no official comment.\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nShe could stand on a strand of human hair, with room to spare. The microscopic polymer statue by South African sculptor Jonty Hurwitz, entitled Trust, measured just 1/100th of a centimeter and had been called the \"smallest sculpture ever made.\" But the world's tiniest woman suddenly disappeared to an unknown location, likely never to be seen again. While she was being photographed through an electron microscope -- the only way to view the minute creation -- Trust vanished, with only a smudged fingerprint left behind by her photographer as a clue. After an hour long search, Hurwitz and the photographer gave in: \"It was horror. I remember saying to him: 'You just destroyed or lost the smallest human form that was ever created in history,' said Hurwitz to CNN Ones to Watch. \"It was gone.\" But was it, really? Hurwitz is an entrepreneur-turned-artist who has applied the same tech wizardry to sculpture that he put into coding a finance site valued at over $500 million. The 45-year-old's \"Nano-sculptures\" are made from a mysterious resin -- \"a big scientific secret\", says Hurwitz -- and created through a process called \"two-photon lithography.\" Hurwitz works with a team of nanotechnology engineers at Karlsruhe University, who focus beams of ultraviolet light to \"zap\" solid the liquid resin, one 3D pixel at a time. The resulting sculptures -- he has also created a statue depicting the classical myth of Cupid and Psyche -- can lie on an ant's head. Put one into the eye of a needle, and it will barely occupy one corner. The \"Nano\" project is just one of Hurwitz' science-inspired sculptural experiments. Another one explores the properties of the mathematical constant Pi, presenting an indecipherable, \"anamorphic\" physical sculpture, whose hidden form becomes clear only when reflected in a cylindrical mirror. And he hints that a forthcoming project will also be influenced by his love of the natural world, but will sit at the opposite end of the scale to his nano-models. Hurwitz, who first made his name as the UK-based co-founder of controversial \"payday\" loans business Wonga, says he makes visual art with a team, as in traditionally collaborative art forms, such as cinema. He discusses accumulating collaborators as an aggressive start-up accumulates new talent:. \"I spent a huge amount of time scouring the world for amazing achievements of humanity and contact these people to work with them. For me the creation of an artwork these days is analogous to the creation of a film: for each piece there may 20 people involved, each one brilliant in their field.\" Hurwitz makes no secret of his desire to bring together contemporary science and art -- delighting in the fact that his nano-scale and 3D printed pieces depend on cutting edge technology, and would have been unimaginable just 10 years ago. Online, fans response has been overwhelming, he says, and the internet has become his exhibition space. It provides an \"epic scale\" that brick-and-mortar galleries can't match, he says, and estimates 13 million people have seen his sculptures since they hit the web in November last year. \"I love the buzz. I love the buzz when I launch a piece on the Internet and on Google Analytics, you suddenly see society engaging... millions and millions of people engaging.\" \"You put a few images on the internet and just watch society consume, engage and think. With comments and blogs and people saying 'It's not art' and people working out the science behind it and people complaining... I just love that buzz! I love influencing society.\" There's also another side -- what Hurwitz calls \"the traditional side of the geeky art world\" -- accusing him of being just an engineer rather than an artist. But he's unapologetic:. \"A lot of the artistic expression that I bring to the world represents the absolute current moment in human development. Whether it's 3D printing, technology or science, I love to represent the now.\" Hurwitz says the creation of the physical artwork is \"just the beginning of its lifecycle.\" So what about the missing woman, whose lifecycle has tragically been cut short? She came back to life during the filming of CNN Ones to Watch (in the video above) -- Trust v.2, her new name, has taken the absent dancer's place. Even still, there are some who think neither dancer was ever there. Invisible to the naked eye, how can we trust this sculpture ever existed beyond the computer screen? For Hurwitz, this mystery gets right to the heart of nano-scale's appeal:. \"You've got this 'emperor's new clothes' element to this end of the scale spectrum, because you look at these nano-sculptures and there's nothing there, there's an element of me going: 'this sculpture... believe me, it's there.' \"At that scale, the sculpture doesn't really exist, or our perception doesn't allow us to perceive its existence. \"In a way, it challenges the whole idea of contemporary art, by asking: 'Hang on, a piece of art you can't really see, is it really a piece of art?'\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nThe shootings' main similarity is that the officer was white and the victim was black and unarmed. Outside of that, the highly publicized police shootings in Ferguson and North Charleston bear only mild resemblance. So what's changed between the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August, and that of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend? And did the backlash and publicity of the Ferguson shooting influence the handling of the North Charleston incident? It's tough to say for sure, but here are some of the stark differences in the cases, the lessons learned by both police and the public, and concrete changes that could help mend tensions in the future. Ferguson: Officer Darren Wilson said he shot Brown after the two struggled over Wilson's gun, and witnesses to the shooting had different accounts -- often conflicting -- of where Wilson was, where Brown was and whether Brown was surrendering or charging the officer. North Charleston: Though it's unclear what happened in the moments before a bystander began recording the incident on his phone, it's 100% clear from the video that Scott was not posing a threat to Officer Michael Slager when the policeman opened fire on Scott as he ran away. Takeaway: Where Brown's killing was a breeding ground for speculation -- with a stark divide between those who said Wilson was justified and those who said Brown was senselessly slain -- no such debate has emerged in the Scott shooting. It would be tough to extrapolate for certain, but it's possible that the clear-cut imagery of an officer shooting a fleeing man in the back resulted in the prompt charges against the officer, and that quick reaction by authorities in South Carolina after the video surfaced headed off the sort of violence that repeatedly unfolded in Ferguson as the process of determining Wilson's fate dragged on for months. Ferguson: Black residents outnumber whites in the St. Louis suburb by more than a 2-to-1 ratio, yet at the time of Brown's shooting, there were only three black officers on the city's 53-member force, and there was only one African-American member of the six-member City Council. (Two more African-Americans were voted in during this week's city's elections.) North Charleston: It's closer to an even split here, with census data from 2010 showing the city is 47% black and 42% white. The makeup of the city's police department is unclear, though it's been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80% black. Three of the 10 City Council members are black. Takeaway: The ratio of white and black officers on the North Charleston Police Department appears to more closely mirror the makeup of its population than does the Ferguson Police Department, but both are considerably off. As for the city councils, the latest election in Ferguson makes its governing body more representative than North Charleston's. But before you place too much emphasis on the percentages, there are other variables to consider, like policing methods, as CNN political commentator Marc Lamont Hill pointed out. Changing the racial makeup of a department alone won't do the trick if officers aren't taught the best practices. \"Black people didn't march and fight and struggle to have black officers kill us and black officers beat us and black officers harass us,\" he said. \"I want police officers who are capable of doing the job properly. We need community-based policing if we're going to believe that police are the proper force to be in our neighborhoods.\" Ferguson: There was no bystander video of Michael Brown's death -- no concrete evidence to support or refute different witness claims about what had transpired. North Charleston: It's unlikely Slager would have been fired and charged with murder so quickly if not for video shot by witness Feidin Santana. Even North Charleston's police chief said he was disgusted by the footage of Scott's shooting. Not only does the video show Slager firing eight shots at Scott as he's running away, it also shows him placing a dark-colored object next to Scott's lifeless body. That could be significant, because Slager initially said Scott had taken his Taser and he feared for his life. But if investigators determine the object dropped next to Scott's body was actually the Taser, Slager could be accused of planting evidence. The takeaway: Ferguson resident Alexis Templeton said what happened in her city helped people across the country to feel empowered to stand up for themselves. The video of the North Charleston shooting, she said, is vital. \"If there is no video, folks don't believe it because it sounds so asinine that something like this would ever happen in this country,\" she said. \"But with a video, you can't say it's not happening.\" Ferguson: The largely peaceful protests in Ferguson were marred by looting, arson and even shootings. Violence erupted again in November after Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, wasn't indicted. And even after Ferguson's police chief resigned last month, two officers were shot during a protest at the Ferguson Police Department. North Charleston: After Scott was killed in South Carolina over the weekend, protests in North Charleston have been peaceful so far. The takeaway: Some Ferguson residents say what happened in their city is playing a role in the way North Charleston is handling its own tragedy. Lee Smith, who recently made an unsuccessful bid for a Ferguson City Council seat, said he was glad to see authorities in South Carolina charge Slager with murder. \"I am hopeful that their motives are right and not just based on the fact that they are trying to avoid the same types of issues that came down in Ferguson,\" Smith said. Ferguson: It took Ferguson police six days to publicly identify Wilson as the officer who shot Brown, and in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, then-police chief Thomas Jackson decided not to visit Brown's family. And rather than charge Wilson and let a grand jury decide whether the charges had merit -- as many civil rights advocates wanted -- the prosecutor in the case instead made the unorthodox choice of presenting both sides himself and letting the grand jury decide whether to charge the officer. North Charleston: Slager was identified by authorities and charged with murder on Tuesday, two days after Santana shared his video with Scott's family. Mayor Keith Summey denounced the shooting and said Slager made a \"bad decision.\" Both Summey and the police chief also visited Scott's family. \"When you're wrong, you're wrong,\" he said. \"And if you make a bad decision -- don't care if you're behind the shield or just a citizen on the street -- you have to live by that decision.\" The takeaway: Former Ferguson Mayor Brian Fletcher said the city has influenced others. \"I think these situations are given much more scrutiny now,\" said Fletcher, who won a seat on Ferguson's city council this week. \"They have seen what has happened here in Ferguson. Every mayor and city council is very cautious in what they say and what they do.\" Ferguson: After Brown's death in August, many asked why Wilson didn't have a body camera. The shooting spurred a nationwide debate over whether officers should wear cameras on their lapels. Three months later, President Barack Obama pledged $263 million to procure body cameras and training for up to 50,000 police officers. North Charleston: Slager also was not wearing a body camera when he killed Scott. But after the shooting, the mayor said the city was ordering an additional 150 body cameras \"so every officer on the street\" in the city will have one. That's in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, Summey said. The takeaway: Not everyone agrees that all officers should wear body cameras. Some police unions have scoffed at the idea, and the American Civil Liberties Union has cited privacy concerns. They're also expensive. Several camera models cost at least $500 each, and storing all that footage can cost as much as $20,000 a year. But National Urban League President Marc Morial said more body cameras will help protect not just the public, but also police. \"I think if officers know that their actions are being recorded on a consistent basis, it's going to protect good officers who do the right thing,\" Morial said. \"But it's also going to ferret out, if you will, bad actions by bad officers.\" CNN's Moni Basu, Gregory Wallace and Wolf Blitzer contributed to the report.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "In August 2014, Michael Brown was shot and killed by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, and in April 2015, Walter Scott was shot and killed by North Charleston police officer Michael Slager in South Carolina. Both victims were unarmed black men, but the similarities end there. In Ferguson, there was a lack of clear evidence and conflicting witness accounts, leading to widespread speculation and unrest. In contrast, a bystander's video of the North Charleston shooting clearly showed Scott posing no threat when he was shot in the back as he ran away. The quick release of the video and swift action by authorities in charging Slager with murder prevented the violent protests that occurred in Ferguson.\n\nThe demographics of the two cities also differ significantly. Ferguson had a 2007 population of 2007 that was 2007% black and 2007% white, with only 2007 black officers and 2007 black city council members. North Charleston, on the other hand, was 2007% black and 2007% white in 2007, with 2007 black officers and 2007 of the 2007 city council members being black.\n\nThe handling of the shootings",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nThe officer charged with murder in the shooting death of an unarmed black man in South Carolina has been fired as anger continues to build around his case. A video shows Officer Michael Slager, who is white, firing eight shots at 50-year-old Walter Scott as Scott has his back to him and is running away. Scott, who was unarmed, was struck five times. Timeline of events. The FBI is investigating, and once again, a shooting involving police has sparked national outrage. \"I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw,\" North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters Wednesday. The mayor spoke at the same news conference that was repeatedly interrupted by protesters, who chanted: \"No justice! No peace!\" They called for Mayor Keith Summey to step down. Summey told reporters that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras \"so every officer on the street\" in the city will have one. That is in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, he said. Just before the conference was set to begin, demonstrators walked in. They were led by a man wearing a \"Black Lives Matter\" T-shirt who shouted, \"This is what democracy looks like!\" Scott's shooting stirred memories of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer. A grand jury declined to indict the officer in that case. But not everyone agreed that Scott's case is like Brown's or that race was a factor. \"We can't get into the brain of another individual, so we can't state that,\" Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said. \"I think it would be irresponsible to say that and try and inflame a community or anything of that nature.\" An autopsy of Scott showed that he \"sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body,\" and his death was the result of a homicide, the Charleston County Coroner's Office said. Asked whether CPR was performed on Scott after Slager shot him, Driggers said: \"In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there.\" The North Charleston Police department was not legally obligated to but chose to hand the case over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, according to a news release from Scarlett A. Wilson, the Ninth Judicial Circuit solicitor. Though Wilson said she is subject to rules that limit what she can say publicly, she stated: \"My role is to hold accountable those who harm others unlawfully, regardless of profession. This office does not dictate nor comment upon police policy, training and procedure. I am, however, deeply concerned when those who are sworn to serve and protect violate the public's trust.\" Slager pulled Scott over on Saturday morning for a broken taillight, authorities have said. The beginning of the video shows the two men standing close to each other. Any words exchanged between Scott and Slager are not audible on the released tape. It's also unclear what happened before Scott started to run away, or why he ran. The officer initially said that he used a Taser stun gun on Scott and that Scott tried to take his weapon. \"Shots fired and the subject is down,\" Slager said, according to police reports. \"He took my Taser.\" Before the officer started firing his gun, a dark object falls behind him and hits the ground. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when the officer approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. When Scott's brother Anthony saw the video, he was convinced the officer had lied, he told CNN. \"There was not a struggle for the Taser,\" Anthony Scott said. \"I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway.\" To  Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was \"running for his life\" away from the officer. \"I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot, no one would have thought that,\" Scott said. The video shows Walter Scott attempting to run away. His back is to the officer, and he is a few yards away when the officer raises his gun and fires. A man walking to work on Saturday recorded the video and provided it to the family. That man, Feidin Santana, spoke to NBC's Lester Holt. He said there had been a struggle between the two men on the ground before he started recording, and that the officer was in control. When asked how he felt about the fact that Slager has been charged with murder, Santana said that \"no one can feel happy.\" \"He has his family and Mr. Scott also has his family. But I think, you know, he made a bad decision. And, you know, you pay for your decisions in this life,\" he told NBC's Holt. \"Mr. Scott didn't deserve this. And there were other ways that can be used to get him arrested. And that wasn't the proper way to do that.\" If convicted of murder, Slager could face life in prison or the death penalty. Who is Officer Slager? \"People are upset, people are pointing out how wrong the officer was for gunning down Mr. Scott,\" South Carolina State Rep. Justin Bamberg said as he stood alongside Anthony Scott on Wednesday. #WalterScott received 11,000 mentions on Twitter in just one hour Wednesday; 243,000 mentions in 24 hours. #RIPWalterScott is also trending, as is #MichaelSlager. Bamberg said he hasn't heard of anyone acting out violently to protest the shooting. He and Scott stressed they don't want that to happen. \"Things are in play now, and this officer is in the process of being prosecuted,\" Bamberg said, imploring anyone listening to him speak on CNN: \"We ask that you let the justice process run its course.\" That message was echoed by Walter Scott's mother, who said she feels \"forgiveness in my heart, even for the guy that shot and killed my son.\" \"He was a loving son, a loving father. He cared about his family and ... no matter what happens, it will not replace my son,\" Judy Scott told CNN's Anderson Cooper. The Justice Department said it would \"take appropriate action in light of the evidence and developments in the state case.\" \"The South Carolina Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation concurrent with the S.C. Law Enforcement Division and are providing aid as necessary to the state investigation,\" the Justice Department said in a statement. \"The Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the South Carolina U.S. Attorney's Office will work with the FBI in the investigation.\" Whether Scott's civil rights were violated will be part of the Justice Department's investigation. In the meantime, Slager remains behind bars. He was denied bail at a bond hearing Tuesday night, CNN affiliate WCIV reported. Slager will remain in custody unless a circuit court sets his bond, a court spokesman told CNN. The court has not set a date for that hearing. According to WCIV, Slager initially said through his attorney, David Aylor, that he followed the appropriate policies and procedures. But Aylor later told CNN that he no longer represents the officer. It's not clear whether Slager has found a new attorney. A CNN examination of Slager's police job application indicates he has been an employee of the North Charleston Police Department for about five years and five months. Instead of wearing his police uniform, Slager now wears a jail uniform. Who was Walter Scott? CNN's Ryan Scallan, Christine Bear, Tristan Smith, Martin Savidge, Dana Ford, Sam Stringer, Randi Kaye, Chandler Friedman, Evan Perez, Don Lemon and Steve Brusk contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "On April 4, 2015, Officer Michael Slager of the North Charleston Police Department in South Carolina was fired and charged with murder after a video surfaced showing him shooting and killing an unarmed black man, Walter Scott, as Scott ran away. The incident occurred during a traffic stop for a broken taillight. The video, recorded by a bystander, shows Slager firing eight shots at Scott, striking him five times in the back. Protests and national outrage ensued, with some comparing the case to the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Missouri. The FBI is investigating, and Slager is being held in jail without bail. The North Charleston Police Department handed the case over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, and the city has ordered additional body cameras for officers. Scott's death was ruled a homicide by the coroner's office. Slager initially claimed he used a Taser on Scott, who allegedly tried to take his weapon, but the video does not support this account. Walter Scott was a loving father and son. The Justice Department is also investigating whether Scott's civil rights were violated. Slager has been with the North Charleston Police Department for about five years and five months.",

Italian authorities have arrested 15 people on suspicion of murdering the Christians at sea, police in Palermo, Sicily, said. Why migrants are dying to get to Italy. The original group of 105 people left Libya on Tuesday in a rubber boat. Sometime during the trip north across the Mediterranean Sea, the alleged assailants -- Muslims from the Ivory Coast, Mali and Senegal -- threw the 12 overboard, police said. Other people on the voyage told police that they themselves were spared \"because they strongly opposed the drowning attempt and formed a human chain,\" Palermo police said. The boat was intercepted by an Italian navy vessel, which transferred the passengers to a Panamanian-flagged ship. That ship docked in Palermo on Wednesday, after which the arrests were made, police said. 'I enter Europe or I die': Desperate migrants rescued this week off Italy. The 12 who died were from Nigeria and Ghana, police said. Thousands of people each year make the dangerous sea journey from North Africa to Europe's Mediterranean coast, often aboard vessels poorly equipped for the trip. Many of them attempt the voyage to flee war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. More than 10,000 people have arrived on Italian shores from Libya since last weekend alone, according to the Italian coast guard. Many die each year while attempting the voyage, often when boats capsized. Last year at least 3,200 died trying to make the trip. Since 2000, according to the International Organization for Migration, almost 22,000 people have died fleeing across the Mediterranean. The IOM reported Thursday the latest boat to sink in trying to make the journey. Only four people survived from the original 45 on board, bringing the estimated death toll so far this year close to a thousand. CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome, and CNN's Livia Borghese reported from Augusta, Sicily. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

Authorities still don't know the fate of many of the passengers, including children, who were on the large ship bound from Libya to Europe that capsized Saturday night in the frigid waters of the Mediterranean Sea. That sinking may be the worst in a series of disasters in which migrants have lost their lives on vessels that are too rickety to survive long voyages. \"Gangs of criminals are putting people on a boat, sometimes even at gunpoint,\" Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said. \"They're putting them on the road to death, really, and nothing else.\" A rescue operation is still underway for people who were on the ship from Libya, and the number of potential victims is not clear. A Bangladeshi survivor told investigators there were 950 people on board. Previous estimates put the number around 700. Maltese authorities, who are working with Italian rescuers, said around 50 people had been saved. But the Italian Coast Guard said 28 people had been rescued and 24 bodies recovered. Two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in Sicily, according to Italian police officer Maria Guia Federico. On Monday, European Union ministers met in Luxembourg and proposed a 10-point plan to help address the crisis. \"We are not yet working on numbers, but what we have agreed on today is, for sure, the need to increase significantly the resources at sea, and the level of the operation, doing more search and rescue and doing it more together,\" Federica Mogherini told CNN's \"The World Right Now with Hala Gorani.\" The EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy said the European Union must fight human traffickers, strengthen Europeans' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees. \"We need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people, so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions,\" Mogherini said. \"My pain is that it was a reaction coming too late after so many people died.\" Migrants have been attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to southern Europe for years, but authorities have reported a sudden surge in the past 10 days, along with a grim spike in the number of those who are killed en route. Already this year, more than 900 migrants are believed to have died while crossing the Mediterranean, far more than during the same period in 2014, the International Organization for Migration said last week. Since the beginning of 2015, more than 35,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea -- 23,500 have landed in Italy and more than 12,000 in Greece, according to the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights. While those numbers sound high, they were even higher the previous year. In 2014, approximately 219,000 refugees and migrants sailed across the Mediterranean, with most having to be rescued by the Italian Navy, Coast Guard or merchant ships, the UNCHR said. It is estimated that 3,500 people in 2014 died at sea. On Monday, yet another boat sank off the Greek island of Rhodes, killing at least three people, the Greek Merchant Marine Ministry said. Of the 83 people reported on board, at least 57 survived. Those confirmed dead were a man, a woman and a child. The capsizing of the ship that departed from Libya marked the worst such disaster so far. As rescuers approached the boat in response to a distress call Saturday night, authorities say, migrants moved to one side, hoping to be saved. Their movement caused the large, multilevel boat to capsize about 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Libya, sending many passengers plunging into the sea. According to one Bangladeshi survivor, large numbers of people remained trapped inside the boat as it sank. Smugglers -- human traffickers organizing the voyages -- had locked the doors to the lower levels of the vessel, the survivor told Italian authorities. \"Our troops, together with the Italian navy, are literally looking through the bodies to try to find someone who's still alive,\" Muscat said. While the shipwreck was an accident, Muscat slammed the human traffickers whom he accused of risking people's lives by putting them on rickety ships in unpredictable waters. It's \"genocide -- nothing less than genocide, really,\" Muscat told CNN. \"A mass grave is being created in the Mediterranean Sea and European policies are responsible,\" said Loris De Filippi, the president of the international aid group Doctors Without Borders. He compared the high number of deaths to \"figures from a war zone.\" De Filippi called on European states to immediately launch large-scale search and rescue operations with proactive patrolling as close as possible to Libyan shores. \"Faced with thousands of desperate people fleeing wars and crises, Europe has closed borders, forcing people in search of protection to risk their lives and die at sea,\" he said. \"This tragedy is only just beginning, but it can and should be stopped.\" Save the Children similarly called on European officials to do more. \"What we needed from EU foreign ministers today was life-saving action, but they dithered,\" the group's CEO Justin Forsyth said in a statement. \"With each day we delay we lose more innocent lives and Europe slips further into an immoral abyss. Right now, people desperately seeking a better life are drowning in politics.\" Many of the migrants who board ships to cross the Mediterranean come from sub-Saharan Africa, often traveling for weeks or months just to get to the ships. They're seeking a better life, but many are exploited by the ruthless smugglers who organize the voyages. \"There is a well-oiled machine with the human traffickers, first by land and then by sea, and they feel the need for these desperate people who just want to get to Europe at all costs,\" said Rome-based journalist Barbie Nadeau. The situation on board the boat that sank over the weekend isn't unusual, based on accounts of previous voyages. On old fishing boats, \"people are crammed into what used to be the frozen live tank compartments in the bottom of the ship,\" Nadeau said. \"Those are the cheaper tickets. People that want to be out on the upper deck, which is the prime space, pay a little more for that service.\" Traffickers are believed to charge anywhere from 6,000 euros to 8,000 euros ($6,450 to $8,600) per person for the dangerous voyage, she said. Italy's proximity to the North African coast puts it on the front line of tackling the continent's migration crisis. \"We're swamped,\" Sandro Gozi, the Italian minister for European affairs, told French daily Le Monde. \"There's not even enough space in Sicily's cemeteries to bury the dead.\" An Italian search and rescue program, Mare Nostrum, was credited with rescuing more than 160,000 migrants in the space of a year. But it ended in October because of budget constraints and criticism from the European Union that the program itself was encouraging migrants to head across the Mediterranean. The European Union's border control agency, Frontex, started its own mission in November, known as Triton, with a budget of less than a third of that of Mare Nostrum. Frontex has no vessels or surveillance equipment of its own, so has to rely on European member states to lend it ships. As anti-immigrant parties thrive across the continent, European nations are collectively struggling to cope with the migration crisis on their doorstep. \"We can't act as if each tragedy is the last while crossing our fingers that another one doesn't happen,\" Gozi told Le Monde, lamenting \"a total absence\" of European Union policy on how to deal with refugees arriving in Europe. The European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, said Sunday it was consulting member states, European agencies and international organizations to prepare what it called a European Migration Strategy to be adopted in mid-May. \"These are human lives at stake, and the European Union as a whole has a moral and humanitarian obligation to act,\" it said. But international groups say European governments are failing to do enough. Doctors Without Borders will begin its own rescue effort, De Filippi said, because \"as a medical, humanitarian organization, we simply cannot wait any longer.\" CNN's Karl Penhaul, Hada Messia, Josh Levs and Catherine E. Shoichet and Khushbu Shah contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The International Organization for Migrants reported on Monday that there may be three more migrant boats in distress in international waters, following a weekend shipwreck off the coast of Italy that may have killed hundreds of migrants. The ship, which was bound from Libya to Europe, capsized in the Mediterranean Sea on Saturday night, leaving the fate of many passengers, including children, uncertain. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat described the situation as a \"mass grave\" and accused human traffickers of putting people on \"the road to death.\" A rescue operation is ongoing, but the number of potential victims is not clear, with estimates ranging from 600 to 1000 people on board. European Union ministers met on Monday to discuss a 10-point plan to address the crisis, including increasing resources at sea and fighting human traffickers. Already this year, more than 900 migrants are believed to have died while crossing the Mediterranean, far more than during the same period in 2014. Migrants have been attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean for years, but there has been a recent surge in the past 10 days. Doctors Without Borders will begin its own rescue effort due to the European Union's inadequate response. The situation on board the boats is often dire, with people crammed into old fishing boats and charged thousands of euros for the dangerous voyage.",

Tensions rose as demonstrators confronted police, several of whom shouted: \"Back up!\" The Baltimore Police Department said the two were detained for disorderly conduct and destruction of property. There were no other arrests and the protests -- on the whole -- were peaceful. Protesters rallied at City Hall before marching to a police station. Some walked through traffic. In one instance, they surrounded a police car. Gray died Sunday, one week after he was arrested by Baltimore police. At some point, he suffered a severe spinal cord injury. His family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died. \"The police have a lot of questions that need to be answered,\" Andrew O'Connell, an attorney for the Gray family, told CNN. \"What was the reasonable suspicion? Why were they arresting our client? These are pretty big questions that need to be answered.\" \"He had no weapon in his hand. He was committing no crime and he wasn't hurting anybody. The police had no reasonable suspicion to stop or arrest him,\" the attorney said. While Baltimore police say five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators, the department has not released details of what the officers said or how Gray might have suffered the fatal injury. Protesters are upset over the apparent lack of information, and -- recently -- a police union's comparison of the demonstrations to a \"lynch mob.\" \"While we appreciate the right of our citizens to protest and applaud the fact that, to date, the protests have been peaceful, we are very concerned about the rhetoric of the protests,\" the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 said in a statement issued Wednesday. \"In fact, the images seen on television look and sound much like a lynch mob in that they are calling for the immediate imprisonment of these officers without them ever receiving the due process that is the constitutional right of every citizen, including law enforcement officers.\" Scenes from Baltimore. That comparison drew swift and sharp criticism, given the history of lynchings of African-Americans in the United States. Rooted in the racial ire of the Civil War, the extrajudicial mob killings of blacks, other minorities and people opposed to oppression of minorities were common in the segregated South. More than 4,000 people were murdered between 1877 and 1950 in 12 Southern states, according to a recent report. But lynchings weren't restricted to the South, and they have deeply scarred race relations in the country. \"Which one is the #LynchMob again?\" John Cotton tweeted, posting a photo of a peaceful protest next to photos of Gray during his arrest and hospitalization. \"The choice of words is not only ironic, it's sad,\" said O'Connell, the attorney for the Grays. \"Police officers are never the subject of a lynch mob. It's actually usually the other way around,\" he told CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront.\" \"And in the context of the powder keg that Baltimore city is right now, referring to the citizens of Baltimore city who are peacefully protesting as a 'lynch mob' doesn't serve to keep the peace. It only heightens the flames, or fans the flames of people who are already on edge.\" Amid protests, officials advised people to clear the area or expect delays.  A statement encouraged employees who work downtown to get out of the area to \"avoid major disruptions.\" Baltimore police requested and received additional personnel from Maryland State Police. Thirty-two troopers arrived to help with crowd control and serve in a \"backup capacity\" for police, according to Erin Montgomery, a spokesperson for Gov.  Larry Hogan. A small rally and press conference was held at noon, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Peoples Power Assemblies. They announced that they will conduct their own investigation into the events that led to Gray's death. Thursday's events follow a series of demonstrations this week, with protesters demanding elusive answers. Baltimore protests: 5 questions demonstrators are asking. Among the questions: Did something happen inside the police transport vehicle that caused Gray's fatal spinal injury? And what took place in the 30 minutes before police called paramedics to pick Gray up? \"Our position is something happened in that van,\" police union attorney Michael Davey said. \"We just don't know what.\" But one question has already been addressed: Did officers have the right to chase Gray in the first place? Police first encountered Gray on April 12 as they patrolled an area known for crime and drug activity. When Gray saw them, authorities said, he started running. Gray's family attorney and protesters claim police didn't have any probable cause to chase him, but did so only because he was \"running while black.\" But Davey said officers had every right to give chase. \"There is a Supreme Court case that states that if you are in a high-crime area, and you flee from the police unprovoked, the police have the legal ability to pursue you, and that's what they did,\" he said. \"In this type of an incident, you do not need probable cause to arrest. You just need a reasonable suspicion to make the stop.\" Gray was arrested after police found what they said was a switchblade on him. An attorney for Gray's family has said the knife was a pocket knife of legal size. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said he met Thursday with the family. \"There was a lot of pain in that family, and I can understand it. If that was my son that ended up the same way, I would be angry,\" he told CNN. Updates and images from the field. One video of Gray's arrest shows officers dragging him to a police van, his legs dangling limply behind him. \"His leg look broke!\" a bystander yells as a witness captures the arrest on a cell phone video. That witness, who only wants to be identified as Kiona, said she knew Gray as a joker and a ladies' man. But that day, he said only one thing to her. \"When I ran up the street and seen him, the first thing I asked him was he OK because I heard him screaming,\" Kiona said. \"He didn't never say yes or no, he just said 'I can't breathe' and just was yelling.\" Former Baltimore Police Commissioner Leonard Hamm said he was disturbed by video of the arrest. \"What I see is a person in distress, and what should have happened is at that point, they should have called for medical attention to help him out,\" he told CNN's \"New Day.\" Hamm led the department from 2004 to 2007. He said he was surprised and disappointed by what has happened. \"I thought we were better than that,\" he said. \"I thought we were better trained than that.\" It's not clear whether Gray was injured during the arrest. His family has not yet seen the autopsy report, attorney William Murphy said. The medical examiner's office told CNN it could take up to 90 days to release the report, which is typical. Gray's body is now in his family's care and has been transported to a funeral home. The family has not specified which one.  That information will be released when arrangements have been finalized. Mary Koch, a member of the family's legal team, told CNN that an independent autopsy will be conducted at the facility. The police department is investigating what happened and will turn over its finding to the state attorney's office May 1, the department said. \"As with any criminal investigation, detectives will continue to pursue the evidence wherever it leads, for as long as it takes.\" The Justice Department is investigating whether Gray's civil rights were violated during the April 12 arrest. And Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she \"absolutely\" believes an outside investigation is needed, especially given the city's dark history of police misconduct. According to The Baltimore Sun, the city has paid about $5.7 million over the past four years to settle more than 100 cases of allegations of police wrongdoing. Police didn't admit fault in any of the cases. The police union said in a statement Wednesday that the reason for the settlements was simple: City officials believe lawsuits are too costly. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Catherine E. Shoichet, Kevin Conlon and Dana Ford contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "Protests over the death of Freddie Gray, a 26-year-old African-American man who died a week after being arrested by Baltimore police, turned confrontational on Thursday evening. Two protesters were taken into custody for disorderly conduct and destruction of property as tensions rose between demonstrators and law enforcement. The Baltimore Police Department stated that five of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest have provided statements to investigators, but have not released details on how Gray sustained his fatal spinal cord injury. Protesters are demanding answers and are upset about the apparent lack of information regarding the incident. The Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 drew criticism for comparing the demonstrations to a \"lynch mob,\" a term rooted in the history of racial violence and extrajudicial killings of African-Americans in the United States. Thousands of dollars have been paid out in settlements over the past four years due to allegations of police misconduct in Baltimore. The Justice Department is also investigating whether Gray's civil rights were violated during his arrest. Protests were peaceful overall, but officials advised people to clear the area or expect delays. The family of Freddie Gray has not yet seen the autopsy report, which could take up to 90 days to be released. An independent autopsy will also be conducted.

For most of those years, the money was deep at the bottom of the Atlantic, the monetary casualty of a cruel World War II sinking. In November 1942,  the unguarded SS City of Cairo was sunk by a German U-boat while carrying 296 civilians and cargo that included 100 tons of silver. The vessel sunk to more than 16,800 feet under the surface (5,150 meters) where it went undiscovered until 2011 when Deep Ocean Search decided to go looking for it. The sinking was the stuff of legend. The City of Cairo was bringing silver rupees from India to England as part of the war effort. After a stop in Brazil, two torpedos sank the ship in the Atlantic. After the ship went under, the U-boat reportedly surfaced and the captain said to the survivors in lifeboats: \"Goodnight, sorry for sinking you.\" The captain's lament is the title of a book about the event. Only a handful of people died as the ship sank but about 100 more passed away during the desperate attempt of the six boats to make it to land, which was hundreds of miles away. When the last of the lifeboats was found 51 days later, all but two people in it had died. Deep Ocean Search said in a news release that during the 2011 search it located an unnatural object on radar. A sub found the City of Cairo split into two parts, buried by silt. \"Under contract to the UK Ministry of Transport, DOS recovered several tens of tons of silver coins from a depth of (5,150 meters),\" the company said. The depth is a world record, the company claimed. Other deep-water operations reported in the media that are close to this depth include the 1987 search for the wreck of a South African Airways plane at 16,000 feet (4,700 meters) and the discovery of the SS Gairsoppa at about 15,400 feet (4,800 meters) in the North Atlantic in 2011. The BBC reported the City of Cairo salvage operation was completed in September 2013, but the British government made the company keep it secret until this week. The coins were melted and the silver sold, the BBC reported. Deep Ocean Search got a percentage of the sale, and the UK Treasury the rest, according to the BBC. At today's rates, 100 tons of silver would be worth about $50 million. Remains of USS Oklahoma crew to be exhumed at Pearl Harbor. CNN's Jessica King contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 166 words:\nThey are superstars flown in from across the globe -- and they probably had more legroom than you. The world's leading showjumping and dressage horses have reached Las Vegas for this week's World Cup Finals. The man who arranged their travel says, for horses, it's business class all the way. \"There are two horses per box,\" explains Tim Dutta, who oversaw the loading of more than $150 million in equine talent onto a Qatar Airways flight at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport earlier this month. \"We pay attention to each horse's little idiosyncrasies and requirements -- do they like wet hay, or not? Do we use sea salt to encourage them to drink? \"I like the horses to have some quiet time too, they need that. So when the aircraft is at cruise then they are left alone for a while, to have a snooze and relax, without being bothered by anyone.\" No horse is snoozing now. The flights are over and they're in Las Vegas to work. Vegas is home to the finals for the sixth time since first hosting showjumping in 2000. The venue is the Thomas & Mack Center, a stone's throw from the Strip, which had the distinction of being opened by Frank Sinatra and Diana Ross in 1983. Organizers believe more than 80,000 fans will attend this week's event, which boasts an $8 million budget. Expect Elvis Presley beaming down from the Jumbotron; chefs from the Bellagio serving VIP guests who paid upwards of $1,500 a ticket; and tennis legend Steffi Graf presenting the trophies. In the past, that was not your usual showjumping and dressage atmosphere -- but that's something the sport is trying to change. Hosting world-class horsesport in Vegas is a way to raise its profile in the United States. As with this month's showjumping on Miami Beach, the thinking is location, location, location. For the riders, few locations are comparable. \"It's like a Wrigley Field feel,\" said Tim Keener, one of the Vegas organizers, describing how the bowl of the arena will seat spectators unusually close to the action. Showjumping comes here for the showbiz. In previous years, trophies have been handed out by flying showgirls descending from the rafters. Elvis impersonators have burst into the arena on horseback. This year, a \"selfie booth\" will let fans crowd in with leading riders for awkward photos on their phones -- and there will be quite some choice of riders. Since the World Cup Finals are among the most prestigious titles available, the cast list over the next four days features almost all of the world's top names. In showjumping, Germany's Daniel Deusser is both the defending World Cup champion and the new world No. 1, unseating Britain's Scott Brash. The Germans are the most successful nation at the World Cup Finals, with 10 showjumping victories, and three-time champion Marcus Ehning will also compete. The hosts have a superstar and 2013 champion in Beezie Madden, while 2012 champion Rich Fellers will ride aptly named \"comeback king\" Flexible, a horse undeterred by a series of illnesses and injuries which would have seen almost any other stallion retire. In dressage, Britain's Charlotte Dujardin and Valero are the runaway favorites to successfully defend last year's World Cup title. The partnership is the first ever to hold the World Cup alongside Olympic, world and European gold. Few riders are expected to mount a serious challenge if Dujardin and Valegro perform well, but watch out for Germany's Isabell Werth and up-and-coming US rider Laura Graves. Graves, 27, has barely spent a year on the U.S. senior team, yet finished fifth in last year's World Equestrian Games on board Verdades. The action begins on Thursday, April 16, with dressage reaching a climax on the Saturday and showjumping a day later. But if you miss it, the chances are you won't have to wait long for another chance. Vegas is so in love with horses, organizers are already planning a bid to bring the event back in 2019.\n\noutput:",

An Omaha taco shop has teamed up with the university to shoot tacos into the stands at sporting events. That the foil-wrapped eats will make to fans was made evident when Voodoo Tacos owner Eric Newton demonstrated the power of the cannon for CNN affiliate KETV. That they'll make it undamaged? Not so much. \"I wouldn't say it would be as restaurant quality when it gets to them, but it's edible,\" Newton said. With this latest technological development, the taco will join t-shirts, stuffed toys, balls, biscuits and the lowly hot dog in hurtling into the stands at public gatherings. UNO fans, um, ate the idea up, sending #tacocannon hurtling past #EarthDay as the No. 1 trending topic Wednesday in Omaha. \"How we roll in Omaha...Frozen Four appearances and projectile tacos,\" Twitter user mavpuck said, referring to the school's recent, and sadly taco-less, appearance in the NCAA hockey tournament semifinals. \"This just might be the greatest invention.  EVER,\" thetoddbryant wrote on Twitter. The tacos will start flying this fall, when the school's new arena is scheduled to open. But Voodoo Tacos has already scored, catching plenty of publicity months ahead of opening night. \"My partners laughed and me and said 'that's dumb,' \" Newton told KETV. \"Now they're emailing me and saying, 'About the best thing we've ever bought.' \"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nYemeni officials said Saudi airstrikes targeting a military base on Tuesday hit a nearby school, injuring at least a half dozen students. The information came from two officials with the governor's office in Ibb province, where the school is located, as well as Houthi sources from the rebel group that is fighting for control of the country. A third source, with the Education Ministry in Ibb, said three students had been killed at the Al Bastain School in Maitam, in southwestern Yemen, as a result of an airstrike. The officials from Ibb's governor's office said the Al Hamza military base was targeted because Houthis have been sending reinforcements from Ibb to nearby provinces. There were no casualties on the base, the officials said, but it was heavily damaged. The school, which is about 500 meters (one-third of a mile) from the base, was not the main target, the officials said. Schoolchildren were heading to their lunch break when the attacks took place, the officials said. The incident was another example of what has become evident in recent days: The chaos in Yemen, now the scene of some of the most chaotic fighting in the Middle East, has left civilians -- noncombatants, both locals and foreigners -- caught in the crossfire. Those trying to escape the violence, either by leaving their homes or by leaving the country altogether, have been flung into a vortex of fear, fatigue, flight and death. Explosions shattered windows in Sanaa, the country's capital. The fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks. At least 74 children are known to have been killed and 44 children maimed since the fighting began on March 26, UNICEF said Monday in a statement. That did not include the children reportedly killed Tuesday in Maitam. Separately, Saudi airstrikes wiped out about a fifth of the armored vehicles recently captured by southern separatists opposing the Houthis near Aden, according to a senior official in the separatist movement. The official expressed frustration about the lack of coordination between the Saudi military and friendly forces in the region, including the anti-Houthi southern separatists. (The Houthis are also sometimes referred to as southern separatists). \"The Saudis have no one on the ground in Aden,\" he said, calling for the military to work out a means of coordination. \"There is very little coordination.\" The group had recently captured about 100 pieces of mixed armor. Among the captured weaponry, the official said, were tanks, armored personnel carriers, and some large artillery.  About 20 pieces were destroyed in the Saudi attack that took place near an old oil refinery. Over the weekend, a Saudi-led coalition smashed parts of Yemen's Defense Ministry Central Command in the capital, senior Yemeni officials said. Despite the rain of bombs, the Houthis still control Sanaa. But the airstrikes have destroyed much of the city's infrastructure. The electricity has gone out on 16 million Yemenis living in Houthi-held areas, the Yemeni officials said. Many fear they will lose access to clean water as well. Yemenis and foreigners are scrambling to leave. Passengers carrying duffel bags and plastic sacks stuffed with clothes were seen boarding an Air India flight as they hastened to leave the capital. Some of them sprinted to the plane. This was a flight that no one wanted to miss. Many were not newcomers to Yemen. Damodar Thakur, a professor at Sanaa University, had lived in the capital for 34 years. \"I never felt like a foreigner,\" he said. He was exhausted by the shelling. \"At night, my goodness!\" he said. \"Gunshots being fired every minute. Sometimes the sky full of sparkling lights. Some women crying, children terrified. Really bad.\" Over the last few days, India has evacuated 2,500 people from Yemen, said Vijay Kumar Singh, the Indian deputy foreign minister overseeing the evacuation. The flights are going to Djibouti, a small African nation about 430 kilometers (265 miles) away. Some evacuees are fleeing on boats from port cities such as Aden. \"More cars in the streets in #Aden. Scared families rushing away in cars with smashed windows & suitcases & mattresses on the roof,\" tweeted Robert Mardini, head of operations for the Middle East for the International Committee of the Red Cross. Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? Houthi rebels control Sanaa, including the airport. But because of the airstrike campaign, the Saudis to some extent control air access, so getting people out requires coordination. The Saudi air force gave Air India a four-hour window to go to and from Sanaa and a specific travel route for a safe landing. As the Air India plane approached the city, the crew could see the scars of the fighting. There were no cars on the roads. Dozens of buildings were destroyed. At the airport, the landing strips and airport terminal were untouched by Saudi bombs, but buildings on the outskirts of the airport and planes along the airstrip had been blown to bits. Loading of the passengers was swift. They approached the planes carrying boarding passes -- a touch of normalcy in an otherwise abnormal event. They didn't pay for the flight, but they had to purchase exit visas from the Houthis. Children sat on their parents' laps to maximize the number of people on the plane. Some passengers fell asleep as soon as they took their seats before takeoff. Everyone seemed to carry the weight of war, especially nurses who had tended the wounded. From Djibouti, the evacuees will most likely disperse to their home nations. \"Now I can only pray for Yemen and those we left behind,\" Thakur said. Who's joining Saudi Arabia's fight against the Houthis? Yemen has descended into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels, Shiites who complain of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country, forced President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power. The Houthis put Hadi under house arrest when they overran Sanaa in January. But Hadi escaped in February, fled to Aden and declared himself still President. Houthis and their allies, including those loyal to Hadi's predecessor, then fought Hadi's forces in the Aden area. Hadi fled Aden in late March, ultimately for Saudi Arabia, when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city. The conflict prompted Saudi Arabia, a predominantly Sunni nation and Yemen's neighbor to the north, to intervene with force along with other Arab nations. The Houthis are allied with Iran, Saudi Arabia's bitter rival across the Persian Gulf, and the Saudis do not want an Iranian proxy in power on their border. At his daily briefing on Tuesday, Saudi Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri told reporters that the ties between the rebels and Iran were clear. He accused Iran of training Yemeni youths to use military aircraft and weapons. After the Houthis seized Sanaa, he said, \"there were 14 flights a week coming from Iran carrying weapons and ammunition for the Houthi militia.\" The U.S. role in backing the Saudis has grown since the bombing campaign began two weeks ago. \"We have expedited weapons deliveries, we have increased our intelligence sharing, and we have established a joint coordination planning cell in the Saudi operation center,\" Deputy Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said. In addition, the United States has promised to resupply the Saudi weapons stocks used in the last two weeks. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter \"emphasized the importance of limiting civilian casualties when conducting airstrikes\" when he spoke with Saudi Defense Minister Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday, the Pentagon said. What about sharing intelligence when it comes to identifying targets? That's a sensitive issue, given the rebels' ties to Iran and concerns about civilian casualties. Guidance from U.S. Central Command stops short of allowing the United States to tell the Saudis what targets to bomb, according to two U.S. defense officials who confirmed details of the guidance to CNN, but declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. The guidance allows the United States to review targets the Saudis have selected, the officials said, and advise them if there are civilian areas nearby or other \"no go\" spots such as mosques and hospitals. CNN's Samira Said, Joe Sheffer and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 159 words:\nNobel literature laureate Guenter Grass, best known around the world for his novel \"The Tin Drum,\" has died, his publisher said Monday. He was 87. Grass died in a clinic in the city of Luebeck, where he was taken over the weekend, said Steidl publishing spokeswoman Claudia Glenewinkel. German media are reporting he died of pneumonia. Grass focused in much of his work on learning from the horror of war and genocide by exploring motifs from his childhood city of Danzig, which is now Gdansk, Poland. During the Nazi era, ethnic Poles and Jews were persecuted and deported from the multicultural city, at a time when they faced the possibility of mass murder. \"In his excavation of the past, Günter Grass goes deeper than most and he unearths the intertwined roots of good and evil,\" the Nobel committee wrote, when it awarded him the literature prize in 1999. But Grass, an outspoken public figure, has sparked controversy in the last decade. In 2006, he confessed that at the age of 15, in 1943, he volunteered for military service in Germany's war of aggression and ended up in the notoriously bloody Waffen SS. Grass said he had no excuses for his choices back then, and that, as a teen, he may even have been excited about belonging to the unit, which he saw then as an elite group. A year later, he penned a detailed account in The New Yorker on how he spent his war years up to the death of German dictator Adolf Hitler. Three years ago, Grass drew controversy again, when he published a poem in a German newspaper discouraging Germany from selling more submarines to Israel. In \"What must be said,\" Grass accused Germany of selling weapons to a potential aggressor out of guilt over the Holocaust. Grass said Israel could use nuclear weapons to kill masses of Iranians. German commentators pilloried him as subconsciously anti-Semitic. Israel invoked a visa ban, and then-Interior Minister Eli Yishai declared Grass a \"persona non grata\" in Israel, the Jerusalem Post reported. Grass' novel characters are the forgotten, the downtrodden and the weird, the Nobel committee said. And like Oskar Matzerath, the boy in \"The Tin Drum,\" they often slip into surreal situations. This was a literary innovation, the committee said, which was furthered by other great authors, such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Nadine Gordimer and Salman Rushdie. On Monday, Rushdie tweeted about Grass' death:  \"This is very sad. A true giant, inspiration, and friend.\" \"The Tin Drum,\" which was published in 1959, \"breaks the bounds of realism by having as its protagonist and narrator an infernal intelligence in the body of a three-year-old, a monster who overpowers the fellow human beings he approaches with the help of a toy drum,\" the Nobel committee wrote. The committee praised Grass' mastery of the German language and his ability to artfully exploit its possibilities of creating seemingly endless yet graceful sentences. Grass was an icon in contemporary German culture with an unchanging iconic look -- his broad mustache, his eyes gazing over the top of his glasses, a tobacco pipe a constant companion in hand. In his later years, he became known for his continuing critique of human history in the 20th century -- and of current events. As recently as March, Grass criticized the anti-Islam movement PEGIDA, Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West. He used the opportunity fire a jab at government that he said was corrupted by money interests. \"It's not Islam that threatens the Federal Republic (of Germany),\" he said in an interview with rp-online.de, \"but political lobbying. Democracy has decayed into fake democracy.\" Grass has also suggested that Germans should be forced to invite refugees from crisis regions to live in their homes as a way of offering more shelter to the world's destitute.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nKathmandu, Nepal (CNN)Rescue crews and residents in Nepal early Sunday began the desperate search for survivors after a magnitude-7.8 quake near the capital of Kathmandu a day earlier flattened homes, buildings and temples, causing widespread damage across the region and killing more than 1,800 people. Follow the latest coverage of Nepal earthquake. Whole streets and squares in the capital of more than 1 million people were covered in rubble. Stunned residents stared at temples that were once part of their daily lives and now were reduced to nothing. Locals and tourists ferreted through mounds of debris in search of survivors. Cheers rose from the piles when people were found alive -- but mostly bodies turned up. The injured ended up being treated outside overflowing hospitals, where crowds of people gathered looking for relatives. Dozens of bodies were pulled from the historic nine-story Dharahara tower that came crashing down during the quake. At least 17 people were reported killed on Mount Everest, where the quake caused multiple avalanches. A seemingly endless series of aftershocks continued to roil the area, further traumatizing survivors. Residents huddled in the cold rain overnight for safety. The death toll of 1,832 is expected to rise as the full extent of the damage is assessed. The loss of life reported so far \"is really based on the information we have from the main cities,\" Lex Kassenberg, Nepal country director for CARE International, told CNN.  \"But if you look at the spread of the earthquake a lot of the rural areas have been hit as well. The information we received from the field is that 80% of the houses in these rural areas have been destroyed.\" The quake was the strongest in the region in more than 80 years. Residents are used to earthquakes in Nepal, and many thought the start of Saturday's quake was a tremor, until the earth kept shaking and buildings crashed down. \"The reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed, injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise,\" said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a statement. \"It is clear that very many lives have been lost.\" An estimated 4.6 million people in the region were exposed to tremors from the Nepal earthquake, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said via Twitter. Thirty out of 75 Nepal districts were affected by the quake. In neighboring Tibet, roads buckled, buildings collapsed and at least 13 people were killed, China's state media reported, citing local authorities. Separately, at least four Chinese citizens in Nepal -- two workers with a Chinese company, a tourist and a mountaineer -- have been killed, state media reported, citing the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu. Officials in India confirmed at least 34 deaths in three states from the Nepal quake. The quake struck at 11:56 a.m. local time (2:11 a.m. ET)  and was centered less than 50 miles northwest of Kathmandu. It occurred at a depth of 9.3 miles, which is considered shallow and more damaging than a deeper quake. It was reported by people in the area as having lasted a long time. One person said he felt as if he were on a ship in rough seas. Kathmandu sits in a valley surrounded by the Himalayas. Siobhan Heanue, a reporter with ABC News Australia, told CNN she was wandering at an ancient temple complex at the moment of the earthquake. Several temples collapsed around her, she said. \"It's not too often you find yourself in a situation where you have to run for your life,\" Heanue said, adding that she sought shelter under the table of a cafe. \"It was utterly terrifying.\" Heanue watched as residents picked through the rubble of a destroyed temple. They found 12 bodies. \"Unfortunately, that search was not fruitful,\" Heanue said. \"There were 12 bodies at least pulled from the rubble in the square. This was just one of several historical temple complexes severely affected by the earthquake.\" The Dharahara tower, the landmark nine-story structure, was packed with people when it collapsed.  Heanue said at least 50 bodies were pulled from the ruins of Dharahara. The tower, built in 1832, provided visitors with a panoramic view of the Kathmandu Valley. Are you in Nepal or have loved ones affected? Please share with us if you are in a safe place. Kanak Masni, a journalist in Kathmandu, told CNN by telephone that this appeared to be \"the most massive earthquake to hit central Nepal since 1934.\" In that quake, which was 8.1 magnitude and centered near Mount Everest, more than 10,000 people were killed. Thomas Nybo, a freelance photographer, was sitting in a coffee shop in Kathmandu's Thamel district. It appeared to be a minor tremor at first but gradually gained intensity, he told CNN. Thousands poured onto the streets of the densely populated tourist hub. \"This region is no stranger to earthquakes,\" he said. \"A lot of people had the same feeling: This is a tremor, it passed. When that wasn't the case, they were in uncharted territory... It's basically an unwritten book.\" Outside the coffee shop, Nybo said he saw a group of women gather near what had been a six-story building. One woman said children were trapped beneath rubble. \"We ran over and ran around the rubble and couldn't hear anything,\" he said. \"There was no chance that they survived.\" Nearby, another building had come down on an area where locals went to do laundry and collect water, Nybo said. A voice was heard coming from the rubble. \"A group of mainly tourists started gathering rocks, hammers and pickaxes and breaking through a re-enforced concrete wall to reach this guy... It took about two hours of smashing through wall and cutting rebar with a hacksaw to pull him out alive.\" Two bodies were found near the spot where the man was rescued, Nybo said. Not far away, lay the bodies of three or four women. \"Who knows how many other bodies lie beneath the rubble?\" he said. The streets of Kathmandu were packed with thousands of locals and tourists who didn't want to go back to their homes or hotels because of recurring aftershocks. Rob Stiles and his wife had just checked into a hotel in Kathmandu when the earthquake struck. \"It felt like it went on forever,\" the California resident said. Witnesses: \"People are panicked, running down to street\" Outside, people ran onto the street, with the temblor knocking some off their feet. A huge section of a brick wall crushed motorcycles and a car. Later, as they walked around the city, an aftershock hit. \"People were screaming and looking around,\" he said. \"There were people clearly shaken, upset, crying.\" Denis McClean, spokesman for the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, told CNN that weak building codes in Nepal contributed to the amount of structural damage. \"Building codes in Kathmandu itself have not been well upheld in recent years,\" he said. \"Efforts have been made over the last few years to strengthen these building codes but, unfortunately, this comes too late for the many thousands of buildings that have gone up across the Kathmandu Valley over the last 20 years that did not adhere to the building codes.\" Chitra Thapa, 48, a CNN security guard in Atlanta, said he spoke by telephone with relatives in Kathmandu and Pokhara, a city about 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of the capital. They were fine and were staying on streets. \"Everybody's in shock,\" he said. \"They never felt an earthquake that big.\" Aid agencies expressed concern for the welfare of survivors in the coming days, as overnight temperatures were expected to drop and people were forced to make do without electricity, running water and shelter. The international community must react quickly to save lives -- particularly those of children -- said Devendra Tak, of the aid agency Save the Children. \"With every minute the situation becomes worse,\" he said. Food, clothing and medicine will be urgently required, Tak said. The U.S. government is providing $1 million in immediate assistance to Nepal, the U.S. Embassy in Nepal said. American disaster response teams are also on their way to Nepal, the Embassy said via Twitter. \"To the people in Nepal and the region affected by this tragedy we send our heartfelt sympathies,\" Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. \"The United States stands with you during this difficult time. How to help the earthquake victims. At a hospital in the Nepalese capital, people with broken bones and head injuries were lying outside, with doctors administering CPR to at least one of them. Residents with scrapes and lacerations were  turned away for those in need of more urgent care. Fast Facts on earthquakes. The U.S. Geological Survey had at first measured the strength at magnitude 7.5 but later upgraded it. A strong aftershock of magnitude 6.6 was recorded a little more than a half-hour afterward, along with nearly three dozen other aftershocks, the USGS reported. The force of the quake was said by people who contacted the USGS to be from \"severe\" to \"violent,\" nearly the highest rating on the intensity scale. Tremors were felt as far as New Delhi, more than 200 miles away in neighboring India. An official said they were felt there at magnitude 5.0. The shaking was rated as \"strong\" to \"severe\" on the USGS ShakeMap. CNN sister network CNN-IBN reported that roads in the area were out. IBN reporter K. Dhiksit looked out his window in Kathmandu and saw the collapsed walls of many buildings. As he watched, an aftershock rattled the street. He heard \"big booming sounds,\" he said, and saw people fleeing into the streets. How are earthquakes measured? Photos of caved-in and toppled buildings appeared on social media. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet, \"We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home & in Nepal.\" Manesh Shrestha reported from Kathmandu. Ray Sanchez wrote and reported from New York. Don Melvin wrote and reported from London. Ben Brumfield wrote and reported from Atlanta.

Wei Tingting, Wang Man, Zheng Churan, Li Tingting and Wu Rongrong were freed from the Haidian Detention Center on the outskirts of Beijing late Monday. The five activists on women's rights -- aged from 25 to 32 -- were picked up by police in three different cities just before March 8, the International Women's Day. They had been planning a campaign against sexual harassment on public transportation. \"I'm still speechless and don't know how to react,\" tweeted Li's girlfriend Suan Xiaola to the couple's friends upon hearing the news. \"No tears, no ecstasy... just wondering what we're going to do next.\" \"I can't hide my happiness for the women but being released on bail is not the end of their ordeal,\" echoed Li's lawyer Yan Xin on Chinese social media. \"Without closing their cases, they still can't live without shackles -- we'll have our work cut out for us.\" Police had recommended last week that prosecutors press charges of \"assembling a crowd to disturb public order,\" which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. The women are still considered suspects in an ongoing criminal investigation and may face charges in the future, Wu's lawyer Liang Xiaojun told CNN. They will be under surveillance for a year with their movements and activities restricted, and police can summon them for questioning at any time, Liang added. \"This shouldn't be a moment of celebration,\" he said. \"The arbitrary detention and release of these women really shows the backwardness of China's legal system.\" Under China's household registration system, only Li is considered a Beijing resident. Police sent the other four back to their hometowns, disrupting their work and lives, according to the women's lawyers. Many have called the five members of Women's Rights Action Group trailblazers. Staging their protests through performance art or flash mobs, they highlighted feminist causes ranging from fighting domestic violence, gender equality at work, to more female public bathrooms -- drawing nationwide attention and even state media praise. Their detention had drawn widespread condemnation, including from the United States. \"Each and every one of us has the right to speak out against sexual harassment and the many other injustices that millions of women and girls suffer around the world,\" said John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State, in a statement Friday. \"We strongly support the efforts of these activists to make progress on these challenging issues, and we believe that Chinese authorities should also support them, not silence them.\" Kerry's predecessor Hillary Clinton -- a longtime champion of women's rights who just announced her bid for the U.S. presidency -- called the jailing of the feminists \"inexcusable\" on Twitter, joining the \"free the five\" hashtag campaign. China had rejected all international criticisms, insisting it's a country ruled by law and that its judicial sovereignty be respected. Supporters of the woman activists, however, sense the chilling effect of their ordeal on China's nascent civil society, as the ruling Communist Party under President Xi Jinping continues to tighten its grip over the country. \"Of course people will feel more afraid,\" said Wei's lawyer Wang Qiushi. \"Women's rights is among the most politically correct issues in China -- now even those who took up that cause ended up in jail.\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 179 words:\nPanama City (CNN)This was the handshake that shook the Western Hemisphere. President Obama briefly met his Cuban counterpart, Raul Castro, on Friday night at a dinner for the dozens of Latin American leaders convening in Panama City for the Summit of the Americas. This was historic. The two nations have barely been on speaking terms -- officially -- for more than 50 years. The meeting was so important that Bernadette Meehan, National Security Council spokesperson, issued a statement: \"At the Summit of the Americas this evening, President Obama and President Castro greeted each other and shook hands.\" Cuba and the United States had endured a half-century of enmity, the tension worsened by the two nations being only 90 miles apart. Key events of those years include some of the most traumatic in modern U.S. history, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Bay of Pigs and the Mariel boatlift of 1980. But the two leaders have been building up to the historic face-to-face. Obama spoke by phone Wednesday with the Cuban leader before heading to Panama. They met Friday at the dinner and are expected to spend a lot more time together on Saturday when the summit begins in earnest. Obama arrived in Panama late Thursday for the conference, which in years past was tinged with animosity at Cuba's exclusion. Moments after Marine One, Obama's helicopter, touched down in Panama City, Castro's plane landed on the same tarmac. Panamanian television carried both arrivals live. During their phone call Wednesday, Obama and Castro discussed the ongoing process of normalizing relations between the United States and Cuba, according to Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes. He said it \"made sense\" for the two leaders to communicate before their anticipated interactions Friday and Saturday. Those run-ins will represent the highest-level talks between the United States and Cuba since a meeting between then-Vice President Richard Nixon and then-Prime Minister Fidel Castro in 1959. \"We're in new territory here,\" Rhodes said on Friday. \"The reason we're here is that the President strongly believes that an approach that was focused totally on isolation, focused totally on seeking to cut off the Cuban people from the United States of America had failed.\" Obama was expecting a warm welcome from the dozens of countries represented at the conference, after announcing in December he was seeking to engage Havana in talks over reopening embassies and removing barriers to commerce and travel. In Panama, Obama is expected to announce he's removing Cuba from the United States' list of countries that sponsor terrorism, a major advance in building diplomatic ties between the two countries. The State Department delivered its report on the designation to the White House on Wednesday; Obama said on Thursday a panel of experts was reviewing it before he makes a final determination. The White House isn't ruling out a final decision before Obama leaves Panama late Saturday night. In remarks during a brief stopover in Jamaica on Thursday, Obama strongly hinted he was ready to remove Cuba from the list, which also includes Iran, Sudan and Syria. \"Throughout this process, our emphasis has been on the facts,\" Obama said. \"So we want to make sure that given that this is a powerful tool to isolate those countries that genuinely do support terrorism, that when we make those designations we've got strong evidence that, in fact, that's the case.\" \"As circumstances change, then that list will change as well,\" he said. While some inside Cuba have expressed dissatisfaction at the pace of the diplomatic thaw, U.S. officials say they're pleased at the progress toward re-establishing diplomatic ties, which the White House argues has helped improve relations with other countries in the region. Obama said in Jamaica he \"never foresaw that immediately overnight everything would transform itself.\" The overtures to Cuba have not been universally popular in the United States; some lawmakers were irate that Obama was seeking to engage what they regard as a corrupt government. Even as Obama landed in Panama the long-standing tensions between pro- and anti-Castro activists was on full display. Dissidents opposed to Castro's regime were violently accosted earlier this week by supporters of the Cuban government. Rhodes said the White House had \"expressed serious concerns\" about the violence and would continue to speak in support of human rights reforms on the island.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "At the 2015 Summit of the Americas in Panama City, President Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro shook hands for the first time in over 50 years, marking a historic moment in Western Hemisphere diplomacy. The United States and Cuba have a long history of tension, with key events including the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Bay of Pigs, and the Mariel boatlift. Obama and Castro had previously spoken by phone and were expected to spend more time together during the summit, which began in earnest on Saturday. Obama arrived in Panama on Thursday and was expected to remove Cuba from the United States' list of countries that sponsor terrorism, a significant step toward re-establishing diplomatic ties. Some opposition to the diplomatic thaw exists in the United States, and tensions between pro- and anti-Castro activists were on display during Obama's visit.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nThe arrest and death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore has sparked protests and accusations of police brutality. But it's unclear how Gray, who was arrested on a weapons charge April 12, suffered a severe spinal cord injury that led to his death seven days later. Here are the big questions surrounding this controversial case:. What we know: Gray was arrested on a weapons charge in a high-crime area of Baltimore known for drugs. He \"gave up without the use of force,\"  Baltimore Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez said last week. An officer apparently took his Taser out and was prepared to use it on Gray, but he never deployed it, Rodriguez said. And none of the six officers involved in the arrest described using force against the 25-year-old. Gray was placed inside a police van and was able to talk, said Rodriguez, who described Gray as upset. \"And when Mr. Gray was taken out of that van, he could not talk, and he could not breathe,\" according to Rodriguez. Police have said Gray was not buckled in with a seat belt during the ride to a booking center. What we don't know: It's unknown what caused the spinal cord injury that led to his death a week after the arrest, and it's also unknown what, if anything, happened inside the van. What we know: Segments of cell phone video shot from two different positions appear to begin after Gray has been arrested and show officers dragging Gray, who is handcuffed, to a van. He can be heard screaming. \"He was dragged a bit,\" said Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, \"but then you see him using his legs to get into the van, so he was able-bodied when he was in the van. And we know that when he was finally taken out of the van, he was unresponsive.\" One woman who recorded a video of the arrest said she knew Gray. \"When I ran up the street and seen him, the first thing I asked him was he OK because I heard him screaming,\" the woman said. \"He didn't never say yes or no, he just said 'I can't breathe' and just was yelling.\" Surveillance video recorded him conscious and talking, police said. That was at 8:54 a.m. At 9:24 a.m., police called an ambulance for Gray. Police say Gray requested medical attention, including an inhaler, and an ambulance later took him to the University of Maryland Medical Center's Shock Trauma Center. Rawlings-Blake and  Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Davis have said the arresting officers should have asked for medical attention immediately after Gray asked for it. What we don't know: It's unknown why Gray screamed, and the cell phone video doesn't capture the entire incident, start to end. And it's unclear why police didn't call for an ambulance sooner. What we know: In the wake of Gray's death, six police officers were suspended. Their names were released last week. The suspensions are standard procedure after an \"in-custody death,\" said Baltimore Police Department spokesman Capt. Eric Kowalczyk. It doesn't mean the officers did anything wrong or that they were the only officers involved, he said. They are: Lt. Brian Rice, 41, who joined the department in 1997; Officer Caesar Goodson, 45, who joined in 1999; Sgt. Alicia White, 30, who joined in 2010; Officer William Porter, 25, who joined in 2012; Officer Garrett Miller, 26, who joined in 2012; and Officer Edward Nero, 29, who joined in 2012. Three of the six responding officers were on bicycles when they initially approached Gray, according to Kowalczyk. Another officer joined the arrest after it was initiated, while one more drove the police van, the police spokesman said. What we don't know: The officers say they didn't use force against Gray, but that's not certain. In fact, details about what each of the officers specifically did have not been released. What we know: According to court documents CNN obtained, there were more than 20 criminal court cases in Maryland against Gray, and five of those cases were still active at the time of his death. The cases involve mostly drug-related charges, but there are charges from March for second-degree assault and destruction of property. Gray was due in court on a possession charge on April 24. He had been in and out of prison since 2009 for various drug cases, according to Maryland Department of Corrections spokesman Gerard Shields. In February 2009, he was sentenced to four years in prison for two counts of drug possession with intent to deliver. Shields said he could not determine from records what kind of drug was involved. Gray was paroled on June 30, 2011. On April 4, 2012, Gray was arrested for violating parole but he didn't go back to prison, Shields said, reasoning that  whatever Gray allegedly did, it \"was something minor.\" Gray did return to prison in May 2013 for drug possession, serving a month behind bars before his release in June. What we don't know: It's not known whether Gray's criminal past had anything to do with his arrest, or his death. What we know: Protesters have taken to the streets of Baltimore daily since two days after Gray's death, rallying around his family.  On the first night, they marched to a local police station chanting \"No justice! No peace!\" On another occasion they marched to City Hall. The demonstrations have been peaceful on most nights, but on Monday rioters damaged buildings and destroyed police vehicles. Looters stole goods from several stores. Some groups of people intervened, keeping additional looters out of trashed businesses. The demonstrators are pushing to get answers about Gray's death and for \"justice,\" as they define it. Similar protests were held in Ferguson, Missouri, following Michael Brown's death and in New York, after the death of Eric Garner. Other small protests have sprung up in other cities in the past week. \"Mr. Gray's family deserves justice,\" Rawlings-Blake told CNN's Anderson Cooper last week. \"And our community deserves an opportunity to heal, to get better, and to make sure that something like this doesn't happen again. The mayor said that any confirmed information will be promptly relayed to the public. \"I want people to understand that I have no interest in hiding information, holding back information,\" Rawlings-Blake said. Some protesters have called for the officers to be arrested and charged. One organizer called for Police Commissioner Anthony Batts to resign. What we don't know: There's no guarantee protesters will get the kind of definitive answers they want about how and why Gray died. What we know: Baltimore police are looking into Gray's death and are expected to have a report for prosecutors by Friday. The probe, like the suspensions of the six police officers, is standard whenever someone dies while in custody. The police's findings will go to the state's attorney's office, where prosecutors will decide whether charges should be filed. Batts said recently that a medical examiner had some initial findings, but needed to get back the results of toxicology reports, which could take weeks. Rawlings-Blake asked for an outside investigation, given the city's dark history of police misconduct. The U.S. Justice Department, which announced a collaborative reform initiative with Baltimore police in October in light of its past problems, is looking into the Gray case, a spokesman said last week. The point of that federal investigation will be to gauge whether a prosecutable civil rights violation may have occurred. What we don't know: What information that investigators, both local and federal, will turn up and when. It is also unclear if the medical examiner called in spinal experts to view the evidence, a possibility Batts raised at a news conference. What we know: Court documents allege that Baltimore Police Department Officer Garrett Miller arrested Gray after finding a switchblade in his pocket. The Gray family attorney called the allegation a \"sideshow.\" Gray was carrying a \"pocket knife of legal size,\" attorney William Murphy told CNN. Police never saw the knife and chased Gray only after he ran from them, the attorney said. The court documents also say that Gray \"fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence.\" \"The officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket. The defendant was arrested without force or incident,\" the documents say. \"The knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring-assisted, one-hand-operated knife.\" Maryland law makes it illegal to \"wear or carry a dangerous weapon of any kind\" -- including switchblades -- \"concealed on or about the person.\" What we don't know: It's not clear that simply having a knife is a crime, said Rawlings-Blake. \"It is not necessarily probable cause to chase someone. So, we still have questions,\" she said. CNN's  AnneClaire Stapleton, Stephanie Gallman, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Dana Ford and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 144 words:\nISIS operatives have executed two groups of prisoners, believed to be Ethiopian Christians, in Libya, according to a video released Sunday by the terror network's media arm. The Ethiopian government confirmed Monday that 30 of its citizens were among the two groups, according to the Ethiopian News Agency. The al-Furqan Media video -- which is highly produced and titled \"Until There Came to Them Clear Evidence\" -- shows two groups of men, one in orange jumpsuits and the other in black, being killed at different locations in Libya, according to the video's narrator. One group is beheaded on a beach along the Mediterranean Sea, while the other group is shot in Southern Libya, hundreds of miles away. \"All praise be to Allah, the Lord and cherisher of the world and may peace and blessings be upon the Prophet Mohammed. To the nation of the cross, we are back again on the sands, where the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, have stepped on before, telling you: Muslim blood that was shed under the hands of your religion is not cheap,\" the narrator says in Arabic on the 39-minute video. The narrator continues, \"In fact, their blood is the purest blood because there is a nation behind them (which) inherits revenge. And we swear to Allah: the one who disgraced you by our hands, you will not have safety, even in your dreams, until you embrace Islam.\" Quoting Mohammed, the narrator says that those who \"perform prayer and pay alms\" will have \"their blood and property\" protected by the Prophet unless Islam dictates otherwise. \"You pay (tax) with willing submission, feeling yourselves subdued. Our battle is a battle between faith and blasphemy, between truth and falsehood, until there is no more polytheism -- and obedience becomes Allah's on its entirety,\" the narrator says. Earlier in the video, a different speaker says Christians in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul were given the choice to embrace Islam or maintain their Christian faith and pay a tax. \"The Islamic state has offered the Christian community this many times and set a deadline for this, but the Christians never cooperated,\" the speaker says. At the beginning of the video, a man who appears to be a judge in a court enforcing Islam's Sharia law holds up documents and says a Syrian Christian had owed a Syrian Muslim 550,000 Syrian pounds (about $2,900) since 2004, but the Muslim was unable to obtain the money under President Bashar al-Assad's regime. \"After applying to the Islamic court he got his money back within one month,\" the man says. The law cited throughout the video comes from the Quran's Surah 9:29, whose exact translation is an area of dispute among religious scholars. The gist is that Muslims are commanded to fight those who don't believe in Allah or the Last Day (Islam's equivalent of Judgment Day) unless the nonbelievers pay a tax or tribute. In February, ISIS released a video of 21 Coptic Christians from Egypt being executed on a Libyan beach. Those captives, too, wore orange jumpsuits. In that video, released by al-Hayat Media Center, another ISIS media arm, a masked man references the killing of Osama bin Laden and his burial at sea. \"The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah, we will mix it with your blood,\" he threatens in English. CNN's Anas Hamdan, Christine Theodorou and Brian Walker contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

The narrator threatens non-Muslims, urging them to embrace Islam or pay a tax, quoting Surah 9:29 from the Quran.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nCharleston, South Carolina (CNN)The casket is draped with an American flag, and Walter Scott is dressed in a dark suit. A white banner with a blue star refers to his favorite NFL team. It says: \"Tradition, the Cowboys way.\" A few mourners trickled into the Fielding Home For Funerals in Charleston, South Carolina. Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley comes by to pay his respects and show support for the Scott family. They are not at Friday night's visitation, the mayor says.  The stress of the past week since Scott was fatally shot in the back by a North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager is too much. They went by the funeral home earlier but they are exhausted, he says. They need their privacy now and at Saturday's funeral and burial, he says. \"This is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community,\" he says, adding they share the grief of their neighbors in North Charleston and with the Scott family. \"It breaks everyone's hearts, wherever we live.\" Meanwhile, police continue to investigate the incident in which Scott ran from his car after a traffic stop then was shot while fleeing from Slager. On Friday afternoon, police met with a man who was in Scott's car when Slager pulled it over for a broken taillight. The passenger's name wasn't in a police report obtained by CNN. The passenger was detained briefly after the shooting, one officer wrote in the report. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said the man with Scott was a co-worker and friend. But he did not identify the friend by name, nor did Thom Berry, a South Carolina Law Enforcement Division spokesman, who confirmed Friday's meeting. Slager has been fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted on a murder charge. Video shot by a witness shows the officer shooting Scott in the back as he runs away. Slager had told investigators he feared for his safety after he and Scott tussled over his Taser. His lawyer, Andy Savage, said Friday he \"has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has.\" Savage's office said in a written statement that it has yet to receive \"any investigative documents, audio or video tapes, other than a copy of Mr. Slager's arrest warrant.\" The news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that Slager belongs to \"is no longer involved in the case.\" On Thursday, dash cam video and a new witness emerged from the day Scott died. The dash cam footage shows Slager talking calmly to Scott during the traffic stop. Scott apparently says he has no insurance on the vehicle, and Slager returns to his car to do paperwork. Moments later, Scott gets out of his car and bolts. A foot chase ensues. Scott never reappears on the dash cam video, but a witness later takes video of the officer shooting Scott several times in the back as he is running away. \"Nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer's life or the life of another was threatened,\" National Urban League President Marc Morial said. \"The question here is whether the use of force was excessive.\" On Thursday, a new witness emerged in the case. Gwen Nichols told CNN's Brian Todd that she saw a scuffle between Scott and Slager at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" Nichols said. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying: 'Stop!' \" Scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop, according to court records. That may be why he ran, an attorney for the family said. Criminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slager's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case. \"Defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- (that) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation, a physical altercation with a suspect,\" Callan said. \"And that would constitute manslaughter under law, as opposed to murder, and it makes a huge difference in sentencing.\" In South Carolina, a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation. What we know about Officer Slager. The investigation has been turned over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, or SLED. In a statement released Thursday, SLED said its investigators found troubling inconsistencies from the very start. \"We believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter,\" SLED Chief Mark Keel said in a statement. \"The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions.\" Feidin Santana, who took the video of the shooting, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott, who was on the ground. He said he could hear the sound of a Taser in use. Santana said he didn't see Scott go after the Taser, as Slager initially claimed. He said he believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana said. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana started recording shortly after that. His video shows Scott running away from Slager before the officer aims his gun. Slager fires eight shots toward Scott, striking him five times. A timeline of events. While the initial traffic stop may have seemed to be perfectly normal and professional, and the foot chase a reasonable choice, an analyst saw little justification for that last act. \"I'm not familiar with South Carolina police training, but I guarantee you that they do not teach to shoot a fleeing unarmed man in the back,\" said Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit. There are several claims in the initial police reports that are not supported in Santana's video. And there may be more to the investigation than just whether Scott's killing was justified, CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos said. \"If it's determined that multiple officers attempted to cover for the shooting officer, and it's shown that those reports were false, this will be a devastating blow for law enforcement everywhere,\" he said. Who was Walter Scott? CNN's Polo Sandoval reported from Charleston and Steve Almasy reported and wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Jim Sciutto, Jason Carroll and Holly Yan contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "Walter Scott, a resident of Charleston, South Carolina, was fatally shot by North Charleston police officer Michael Slager on April 4, 2015. The incident occurred after a traffic stop for a broken taillight. Scott, a fan of the Dallas Cowboys, was dressed in a dark suit and his casket was draped with an American flag during his visitation at the Fielding Home For Funerals. Mayor Joseph Riley of Charleston paid his respects to the Scott family, who were not present due to the emotional stress of the situation. The investigation into the shooting continues, with Slager having been fired and facing life in prison or the death penalty if convicted on a murder charge. Witness footage shows Scott being shot in the back as he ran away from Slager, contradicting the officer's initial claim that he acted in self-defense. A new witness emerged, reporting a scuffle between Scott and Slager before the shooting. Scott had a bench warrant for unpaid child support at the time of the stop, which may have prompted his decision to flee. The investigation has been turned over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, with concerns raised about inconsistencies in the initial police reports. The shooting has sparked widespread outrage and calls for justice.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nJon Reiter is no stranger to Mount Everest -- its world-record height, its prestige, its challenges. And its dangers. He learned that again shortly before noon Saturday, after a monster magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nepal. It not only rattled cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara, but caused avalanches at Everest and nearby peaks. Reiter was safe but shaken by the devastation. He told his wife, Susan, about his putting one dead person in a sleeping bag and zipping it up, seeing others killed by the falling ice and collapsing snow, and doing all he could to help others fighting for their lives. \"It's been a really rough day,\" Susan Reiter told CNN. \"Jon's been comforting injured people that he doesn't think will survive.\" Jon Reiter told CNN on Sunday morning that 17 people had been killed on the mountain. The Indian Army's Everest Expedition evacuated the bodies of 13 mountaineers from a base camp who had been preparing to scale the mountain,  spokesman Col. Rohan Anand said Saturday. Separately, Dr. Nima Namgyal told CNN he has seen 14 bodies so far. Many of those killed came from other countries, according to Namagyal, something that's not surprising given Everest's lure for many hikers around the world. What may be as remarkable is all those who survived, a number that's likely in the hundreds. They are women and men like Alex Gavan, who tweeted about running for his life from his tent. \"Huge disaster,\" the mountaineer said hours later, warning that the death toll could skyrocket if helicopters didn't come quickly to evacuate those hurt. \"Helped searched and rescued victims through huge debris area. Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap.\" Another hiker, Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, wrote on Facebook that \"a huge avalanche swept over basecamp\" that had almost 500 tents, saying he survived by hiding behind a stone structure. Afterward, the camp's dining tent was transformed into a makeshift hospital headed by the camp manager, who happens to be a doctor. And even hours after the biggest quake struck, the threat of more casualties -- and the challenge of finding out how high the toll actually is -- remained very real. \"On top of the whiteout after the avalanche it has been snowing since last night so it is difficult to see the following avalanches, and there are so many - maybe one every 5 min - that I have stopped counting,\" Pedersen wrote on Facebook. \"This also makes it more difficult to search for people.\" Several companies specialize in bringing hikers to Everest. One of the biggest is Alpine Ascents International, based in Washington state. \"The Alpine Ascents International Mt. Everest climbing team was in the icefall and is now safe at Camp 1, avoiding the avalanche that hit Base Camp,\" the Seattle-based company reported on Facebook. \"Please keep those affected in your thoughts as we continue to receive updated reports on the damage and losses in Nepal.\" But not every foreign company that brings climbers to Nepal was so lucky. Two reported the deaths of Americans on the mountain. That includes British-based Jagged Globe, which has offered mountaineering expeditions, courses, adventure skiing and other experiences for the past 20 years. The company reported Saturday that American Dan Fredinburg died in the Everest base camp avalanche, while two others suffered non-life-threatening injuries. A Google executive who made headlines for dating actress Sophia Bush, Fredinburg had been posting photos and updates of his adventures in Nepal on Instragram and Twitter, where he referred to himself as an \"adventurer, inventor, and energetic engineer.\" His sister updated the account with a message, saying he suffered a major head injury. \"We appreciate all of the love that has been sent our way thus far and know his soul and his spirit will live on in so many of us. All our love and thanks to those who shared this life with our favorite hilarious strong willed man. He was and is everything to us,\" his sister, Megan, wrote. The expedition company sent its condolences. \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to Dan's family and friends,\" read a statement on Jagged Globe's website, \"whilst we pray too for all those who have lost their lives in one of the greatest tragedies ever to hit this Himalayan nation.\" Eve Girawong, a base camp medic from New Jersey who worked on the mountain, also was killed, according to her family and employer. \"On behalf of my family, it is with deep sadness that I write that our beloved daughter, younger sister and best friend has been taken from us today.  Nong Eve Girawong was doing the thing she loved doing most -- helping others.  Words cannot describe the heartbreak and pain that we are currently suffering,\" a family member wrote on Facebook. She was working for Madison Mountaineering, a boutique mountain guide service based in Seattle. Kurt Hunter, one of the company's co-founders, confirmed her death. Jim Whittaker, the first American to reach the summit of Mount Everest back in 1963, is still a mentor to experienced climbers trying to follow in his footsteps. The 86-year-old confirmed that climbers he knows to currently be on Everest are safe. But some are trapped above the icefall, \"which is very dangerous anyway,\" Whittaker told CNN. Since the avalanches, \"the whole route would be different now than before the quake. They'll have to put a new route in from base camp up through that icefall ... They (the climbers) will have to cool it for a couple days, way until the route is reestablished ... they've got enough food and fuel for the stoves.\" His son, Leif Whittaker, told CNN that he hasn't heard from everyone he knows to be on Everest. \"It's really tragic and I'm really saddened by the news,\" he said. \"I have a lot friends in the area and friends on Everest right now. It's hard to get news from base camp and the mountains because communication is difficult as it is. Many of my friends are safe, but I'm not sure if all of them are. \"It's been a bad few years on Everest,\" he said. \"My heart goes out to them, and I'm sending them my love and strength.\" This tragedy struck just over a year after another deadly avalanche on the 29,035-foot peak that likewise sent everyone -- from seasoned Sherpas to foreign tourists -- running for their lives. At least 13 Nepalese locals and Sherpas were killed in that incident, which at the time was the deadliest incident ever around Everest. The highest single-day death toll before then came in May 1996, when eight climbers disappeared during a big storm -- an episode chronicled in Jon Krakauer's bestselling book, \"Into Thin Air.\" Given the scale of the avalanches and fact they occurred near the start of the busy spring climbing season, it's possible this day could turn out to be the most deadly. Climbers traditionally arrive in April to get acclimated to the high altitude before trying to scale the summit. There's no guarantee they'll get the chance to go up this season. After last year's avalanches, the mountain was shut down. But whether it's their livelihood or their obsession, the people who tackle Everest will be back. \"This is our job,\" said Pasang Sherpa, who lost \"friends in brothers\" in the 2014 avalanche. \"So there is always a risk of death.\" For many mountaineers, the draw of Everest has long been hard to resist. One of them is Reiter, who has scaled all of \"The Seven Summits\" -- the highest mountain on each of the seven continents -- except this one. This would be his third straight year trying. He turned back in 2013 \"because it didn't feel right\" and survived last year's avalanche, according to his wife Susan. Her husband phoned her multiple times since the latest avalanches, reassuring her that he's OK physically even as he struggles emotionally with the tragedy. But does that mean he won't go back to try to scale Everest again? \"You would think that he wouldn't because of this and because of last year,\" Susan Reiter said from her Northern California home. \"But knowing my husband I think he will. I hope not, but I don't want to hold him back.\" Nepal rescue efforts come down to neighbors. CNN's Katia Hetter, Jessica King and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nSeveral of the world's worst terrorist groups, like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, aim to create societies governed by strict, distorted versions of Sharia law. That means anyone who doesn't subscribe to such extremist views are enemies and in danger -- Christians included. Of course, Christians aren't the only ones who have suffered at the hands of such organizations. For example, most victims of ISIS are fellow Muslims who refuse to go along with the ISIS worldview and ruthless tactics. Still, there's ample evidence that Christians have been targeted. The latest came Friday, when an Italian prosecutor revealed that a network of Pakistanis associated with al Qaeda talked about attacking the Vatican back in March 2010. \"This is ... a reminder about the world we're in right now,\" U.S. Rep. John Delaney, D-Maryland, told CNN on Friday. \"...I do think there's a larger narrative about Christian persecution (by) militant groups around the world.\" This attack wasn't carried out, but many others have been. Some acts are not centrally organized but are no less horrific, such as reports that Muslim migrants threw 12 Christians off a boat in the Mediterranean Sea. Other deadly acts and alleged plots have been blamed on established terror groups, including these recent examples:. Sid Ahmed Ghlam asked for an ambulance to come to his Paris home on Sunday after (he claimed) he accidentally shot himself in the thigh. Besides getting medical help, Ghlam was arrested after authorities found four Kalashnikov guns, a revolver, ammunition, police armbands and more in his car and residence, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said on Wednesday. They also turned up \"documents in Arabic mentioning al Qaeda and ISIS\" and correspondence with someone in Syria \"asking him to target a church.\" Prime Minister Manuel Valls later went to a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif, one of the at least two such Christian places of worship that Ghlam allegedly targeted. While he didn't elaborate, Molins said that the satellite navigation system in Ghlam's car -- which included a loaded Kalashnikov and more -- had one church's location plugged in. It's not clear what group, if any, Ghlam was working with or possibly getting orders from. Still, authorities flatly characterized him as a terrorist -- linking him to the death of 32-year-old Aurelie Chatelain, whom Molins called the region's first victim of terrorism since the Charlie Hebdo massacre and kosher market siege in January. Regardless of whether Ghlam is ever convicted in Chatelain's killing, it appears unlikely that he'll be able to commit more violence anytime soon. \"A terrorist attack has been foiled,\" French President Francois Hollande said. ISIS has turned its beheadings of hostages into horror shows, producing propaganda videos seemingly aimed at producing the maximum amount of terror. What set the one from April apart were the number of people killed and that they were Christians from Ethiopia. Ethiopia's government said Monday that 30 of its citizens were among two groups of prisoners shown being beheaded in Libya in a video released a day earlier, according to the Ethiopian News Agency. That 39-minute video shows one set of captives killed on a beach along the Mediterranean Sea, while the other group is taken hundreds of miles away, to southern Libya. \"All praise be to Allah, the Lord and cherisher of the world and may peace and blessings be upon the Prophet Mohammed,\" the video's narrator says in Arabic. \"To the nation of the cross, we are back again on the sands, where the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, have stepped on before, telling you: Muslim blood that was shed under the hands of your religion is not cheap.\" The same video brazenly claims that ISIS has been merciful to Christians in Iraq -- by giving them the choice of paying a fine if they refuse to convert to Islam. But not all have taken this offer, according to a different speaker. \"The Islamic State has offered the Christian community this many times and set a deadline for this,\" this speaker says, using the name ISIS calls itself. \"But the Christians never cooperated.\" Everyone at Kenya's Garissa University College suffered in some way when a handful of Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed the campus early this month. But death was reserved for Christians. According to AFP, the terrorists separated students by religion -- allowing Muslims to leave and killing Christians. Nightmare accounts soon emerged, like that of Cynthia Cherotich, who told CNN that she he hid in her closet when gunmen burst in and called out two of her roommates. \"(The attackers) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, ... then you lie down,\" recalled Cherotich, who refused to come out for two days. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" This tactic of separating non-Muslims from Muslims mirrors what Al-Shabaab attackers did in December at a quarry in the Kenyan village of Kormey, where at least 36 were killed, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. One of Al-Shabaab's explicit aims is to turn Somalia, its home base, into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council of Foreign Relations. But that's not its only apparent goal, as the group has increasingly branched out -- including into neighboring Kenya, which is 80% Christian -- to inflict pain and terror. After the the Kenya university attack, which left nearly 150 people dead, Nadif Jama, Garissa's regional governor, dismissed Al-Shabaab's claims that it only kills non-Muslims as \"a tricky way of doing business.\" \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that, in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Jama said, claiming the group's militants are \"bent on nothing but destruction. ... That is something we need to fight.\" Two suicide blasts rocked a Christian community in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, killing at least 14 people and wounding scores more, according to officials. And that's just the beginning, pledged the Pakistani Taliban. One of the blasts left behind panicked residents, twisted metal and shattered glass outside a church compound in the Nishtar Colony of Lahore, according to video aired by CNN affiliate GEO News. Afterward, Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan claimed responsibility for the carnage and promised more such attacks until Sharia law is implemented in Pakistan. These blasts recalled one from September 2013, when 81 people died in a suicide bombing at the All Saints of Church of Pakistan in Peshawar. Two attackers burst into the church filled with about 500 people right as services concluded, blowing themselves up, according to the Protestant diocese. Choir members and children attending Sunday school were among the dead. In a subsequent statement, the Rev. Humphrey S. Peter, the bishop of Peshawar, called the attack a \"total failure\" of official efforts to protect minorities such as Christians, who make up less than 3% of Pakistan's population. Sadly, the shock of the mass killings of the Ethiopian Christians in April may have been dulled simply because of a nearly identical atrocity a few weeks before. ISIS released a five-minute video in February showing the mass murder of Coptic Christians from Egypt. Produced by the Islamic State's propaganda wing al-Hayat Media, the video shows black-clad jihadists standing behind their victims on a Libyan beach. Some of the hostages cry out \"Oh God\" and \"Oh Jesus\" as they are pushed to the ground, just before they take their final breaths. \"The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah, we will mix it with your blood,\" a masked man says in English before the beheadings. News of this mass beheading emerged weeks after 21 Egyptian Christians were kidnapped in two incidents in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte. The ISIS video shows the beheading of around a dozen men, though Egyptian officials say all 21 kidnapped Christians were killed. Egypt's government responded with airstrikes on 10 targets used for training and storage in ISIS' Libyan stronghold of Derna, according to Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. \"Avenging Egyptian blood and punishing criminals and murderers is our right and duty,\" the Egyptian military said in a statement that was broadcast on state television. Modern-day Assyrians are a significant part of human history, tracing their roots back to one of the earliest civilizations. Their ancestors were also some of the first people to embrace Christianity in large numbers. Now the Assyrians are battling ISIS for survival in their native Syria and Iraq. This fight came into focus in February, when the militant group took over villages and took more than 260 Assyrians hostage in northeastern Syria, according to Osama Edward, the founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network. Edward expressed fears then that these Assyrians in Syria would meet the same fate as others in neighboring Iraq. Some of the Assyrian hostages taken in February have been released, but the fate of many more remains unknown. Even those not in captivity face dire threats, given ISIS's well-established reputation of offering little to no mercy to Christians. The number of Christians in Iraq has plummeted -- from 1.5 million some 20 years ago to some 300,000 today, according to estimates from CAPNI, the largest Christian relief organization in northern Iraq. ISIS isn't the only reason for this drop, but it certainly is a big one. The militant group has been brazen in its onslaught in Iraq as well as Syria, with Christians among its targets. That includes its taking over Iraq's largest Christian city, the mostly Assyrian community of Qaraqosh, in August 2014. ISIS has inflicted pain and suffering well beyond Qaraqosh, though, like its capture and control of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. The group's advance there prompted Christian families to flee rather than adhere to the ultimatum of converting to Islam, paying a fine or facing \"death by sword.\" Mark Arabo, a Chaldean-American leader and spokesman for the group Ending Genocide in Iraq, claims that Iraqi Christian children have been beheaded, mothers raped and fathers killed by ISIS militants in recent months. \"This is truly a living nightmare that's not going away,\" Arabo told CNN. \"Christianity in Mosul is dead, and a Christian holocaust is in our midst.\"\n\noutput:",

Today, because of a CNN story and the generosity of donors from around the world, Kekula wears scrubs bearing the emblem of the Emory University Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing in Atlanta, where she's learning skills she can take back home to care for her fellow Liberians. \"It's a surprise -- a young child like me who came from a very poor background coming to the U.S.,\" she said. \"I'm thankful to CNN and I appreciate the people who made donations, and I'm thankful to Emory for accepting me to study.\" At Emory, Kekula has asked for special training on certain skills, such as caring for burns, a common type of injury because children in Liberia sometimes fall into the open fires used for cooking. One of her instructors, Kelly Fullwood, said Kekula's an excellent student who has taught her teachers a thing or two about how to do procedures without costly equipment, as she's been forced to do in Liberia. \"She fascinates me every day,\" Fullwood said. \"She gets nursing. She gets what it's about.\" Kekula, 23, was just a year away from finishing up her nursing degree in Liberia when Ebola struck and her mother, father, sister and cousin came down with the disease. Hospitals were full and no doctors would visit her home, so with just advice from a physician on the phone, Kekula took care of all four of her relatives at the same time. All but her cousin survived -- a high success rate considering that at the time, about 70% of Ebola patients were dying in Liberia. Kekula couldn't continue her nursing education in Liberia, because the schools had closed. A CNN story about Kekula in September prompted donations from around the world to IAM, an organization that raises money to help African natives pay for education. David Smith, an associate dean at Emory's nursing school, said they accepted Kekula because they were struck by how both she and Emory each treated four Ebola patients at around the same time last year -- and Emory had dozens of doctors and nurses and millions of dollars in technology while Kekula had nobody and nearly no supplies. Stop Ebola where it starts. \"It was obvious to us that this woman was intelligent and strong and fearless,\" he said. Kekula is scheduled to return to Liberia in August. \"These things that I have learned here I am going to take back to my fellow nurses,\" she said. \"I love to care for people. I love to save lives.\" Extraordinary people.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "In September 2021, CNN featured the story of Fatu Kekula, a young Liberian woman who bravely cared for her Ebola-stricken family using makeshift protection. Donations from around the world, inspired by the story, enabled Kekula to study nursing at Emory University in Atlanta. Now, she wears Emory scrubs and receives specialized training, including caring for burns, a common injury in Liberia. Kekula, 23, lost her mother, father, sister, and cousin to Ebola but saved her cousin. Unable to complete her nursing degree in Liberia due to the virus, she was accepted into Emory based on her intelligence, strength, and fearlessness. Kekula plans to return to Liberia in August to share her new skills with her fellow nurses.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 130 words:\nIt's one of the most famous faces in history, even though no one really knows what he looked like. Instead, every culture, every generation, remakes Jesus in its own image. A blonde-haired, blue-eyed savior when America was mostly Anglo-Protestant, at least in Hollywood's eyes. An androgynous, meek-and-mild messiah during the anything-goes 1970s. A studly action-figure hero after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Flip through the gallery above, and you'll see what I mean. If you turned on the television this past Sunday, though, a new vision of Jesus came into view. Darker, in mood and skin tone. Earthy rather than ethereal. If not following all of history's clues -- Hollywood has yet to cast an actual Jew as Jesus -- then at least inching closer. Flipping through the channels on a day millions of Western Christians celebrated the resurrection of their savior, viewers could choose from \"Killing Jesus,\" a NatGeo production rebroadcast Sunday on Fox. \"A.D.,\" NBC's sequel to the blockbuster miniseries \"The Bible,\" and \"Finding Jesus,\" CNN's addition to the ever-burgeoning body of Christ-centered TV fare. Does God have a prayer in Hollywood? What unites these disparate projects, besides a recognition that Jesus always draws an audience and the Good Book is good for business, is the type of men chosen to play Christ. They are brawny, with brown eyes and dark complexions. They look like men who could be carpenters, if not in Nazareth, than at least in the Mediterranean neighborhood. Haaz Sleiman, from \"Killing Jesus,\" was born and raised in Lebanon. He's also Muslim, a fact that annoyed some Christians, who took to Twitter to voice their displeasure. Adam Bond, a British actor of mixed heritage, including Native American, portrays Jesus during the historical reenactments in \"Finding Jesus.\" And Juan Pablo Di Pace -- a Argentinian named after the late St. Pope John Paul II -- takes a starring role in \"A.D.,\" replacing Diogo Morgado, dubbed \"hot Jesus,\" by some, \"smarmy Jesus\" by others. You could make the case that authenticity is the coin of our current entertainment realm, and that filmmakers are competing to make their work as historically accurate as possible. Contemporary viewers are too savvy to stomach the fake beards and odd accents that littered the camels-and-sandals epics of eras past. But there's another, deeper meaning behind our new, multicultural Jesuses, scholars say. \"Filmmakers and networks are in touch with the fact that the complexion of America has changed,\" said Stephenson Humphries-Brooks, a religion scholar and author of \"Cinematic Savior: Hollywood's Making of the American Christ.\" \"A large number of Americans are people of color: Latinos and Middle Easterners and people from India,\" Humphries-Books continued. \"That means the audience base is shifting in various and important ways.\" The audience base may be shifting, but it's also tuning in. Each of the Jesus shows drew big ratings, which means you'll likely be seeing more of Christ as you channel surf. But according to the Apostle Paul, almost every depiction of Jesus so far has gotten at least one detail wrong: his flowing locks. Real men don't wear long hair, said the New Testament scribe.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "This article discusses how the portrayal of Jesus in media has evolved throughout history, reflecting cultural shifts and societal values. From a blonde-haired, blue-eyed savior during Anglo-Protestant times to an androgynous, meek-messiah during the 1970s, and a studly action-figure hero post-9/11, each generation has remade Jesus in its own image. Recently, there has been a trend towards casting darker-skinned, brawny actors with brown eyes to play Jesus, such as Haaz Sleiman, Adam Bond, and Juan Pablo Di Pace. This shift reflects the changing demographics of America and the increasing importance of authenticity in entertainment. Each of the recent Jesus shows, including \"Killing Jesus,\" \"A.D.,\" and \"Finding Jesus,\" drew big ratings, indicating a continued interest in Christ-centered TV fare. However, some viewers have criticized the casting of non-Christian actors to play Jesus, such as the Lebanese Muslim Haaz Sleiman in \"Killing Jesus.\" Despite the ongoing debate, it seems that filmmakers are striving for historical accuracy and cultural representation in their portrayals of Jesus.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nCaledonia, Michigan (CNN)Ben and Shelby Offrink met in college. It wasn't the most romantic setting -- a study group for calculus-based physics -- but Ben managed to turn it into a story worth telling by cheating. \"I set up a study group and ended up telling the other people not to come so it would be just the two of us,\" said Ben with a smile. \"He was sneaky,\" says Shelby. \"Yeah, I wanted to meet her,\" says Ben, \"and that was the best way I could figure out.\" Fast-forward eight years to 2014. Ben, now 34, and Shelby, a newly minted 30-year-old, were married and raising little Maeve, 3, and baby Hazel, 3 months, in Caledonia, Michigan, when life suddenly turns upside down. \"I thought it was sciatica,\" Shelby says of the back pain and the \"odd\" feeling that prompted her to go to the hospital. \"But I couldn't get the doctors in the ER to pay attention. So I went back the next day and told them that I was incontinent, and they did an MRI and there it was.\" \"It\" turned out to be an intramedullary glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. Shelby's version was extremely rare because it was lodged in her spine instead of her brain. \"So it's actually tangled into the spinal cord itself,\" Ben explains. \"If you'd imagine a meatball inside of bunch of spaghetti, you can't just easily take it out without damaging a bunch of the spinal cord itself.\" Surgery removed 75%. The rest was treated with a combination of oral chemo and radiation. But suddenly a second spot above the first grew worse and the area of radiation had to be broadened. After a week of treatment, Shelby suddenly lost feeling in her legs. Unfortunately, the numbness became permanent. Before long, Shelby was paralyzed from the belly button down. But that didn't stop her fighting spirit or her sense of humor. Shelby nicknamed her tumors and decided to \"terminate\" them. \"You pronounce it as 'tumah tumah-nator,'\" Ben says. \"Like how Arnold Schwarzenegger would say it if he had a tumor.\" As Shelby continued to fight and improve, in August 2014, Ben got some terrible news. The Hodgkins lymphoma he had fought and battled into remission when he was 20 had reappeared. And it probably had been hiding in his body for a few years, making it extremely hard to overcome. \"I thought it was never a concern again,\" Ben says. \"The procedures I went through, having a bone marrow transplant, I thought there wouldn't be any issues. It's been over 15 years. It caught everyone completely off guard.\" Ben was slated for a clinical trial with an experimental drug, but his alkaline phosphate levels were too high to meet the requirements. With no other options in the Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor or Detroit areas, he is now on generalized chemotherapy, hoping it will force the cancer into remission so he can undergo a bone marrow transplant. Two donors have been found that are a perfect match, if the cancer will respond. \"As it goes on, they are saying it's getting harder and harder to treat,\" he says. \"It's just like a car picking up speed. Eventually you're going to have 5 million cells, it's just going to keep growing and growing.\" Suddenly, both parents were undergoing the nausea, fatigue and discomfort of chemotherapy while trying to raise two small children. \"Some days it does feel like a battle,\" Ben admits. \"The days you are feeling absolutely horrible you don't even want to get out of bed, but you know you have to because you have to take care of the girls or help Shelby. Some days it's just way tougher than others.\" Friends and family became critical to the family's success, taking over updates to the family's online journal, and running fundraisers for medical expenses and building supplies to make the house wheelchair-friendly. \"We'd had an amazing support group,\" Ben says. \"Shelby has friends from high school who will drop everything to help us out at a moment's notice. And the community, it's just amazing for people to help that much. \" \"Even outside of our community, people we don't even know,\" adds Shelby, wiping a tear from her eye. \"We've had care packages sent from Ireland, Sweden and Australia. It means a lot.\" This January came the worst news yet. Shelby's cancer, which had retreated from her spine, suddenly appeared in her brain. Three tumors. Inoperable. What is Shelby's reaction? \"I'm not giving up,\" she says. \"Ben and I have a long road ahead of us. We know it's going to be hard, but we're going to do it.\" \"For me it's just something that you have to do,\" Ben says. \"You have to fight it and you have to beat it because there is no option.\" Maeve, who is 4 years old now, and Hazel, 1, will have a home with Ben's brother if the worst is to happen, and friends are setting up fundraisers for the girls' education. But that's not the focus of Ben and Shelby's fight. They want to get well. \"Yeah, we have two little ladies we have to take care of,\" Shelby says, \"and lots of family and friends that care about us.\" \"She's not just doing it for herself, she's doing it for her whole family, especially her girls and her husband, Ben,\" said Jay Tomczak, Shelby's older brother. \"She's not going to ever give up. What we really need is hope.\" The Offrinks would like help finding clinical trials to address the rare cancers they are fighting, as well as access to cancer centers with more advanced techniques than are available in Michigan. \"We're going to get all of our information and would like to go to Harvard or Mayo (Clinic) or places where maybe they do have more experience, and act in a shorter time frame,\" Shelby says. \"If, right now, we can find two or three trials that maybe Shelby can get into, or a trial drug for me to try instead of the path I'm on right now, it could definitely benefit us,\" adds Ben. \"We just can't wait,\" Shelby says. Her prognosis is about six months, she says, and a year for her husband. \"Never give up, because there's no reason to. Just keep fighting,\" Shelby says. She breaks into tears: \"Especially when you have someone special to fight for and everyone has someone special to fight for -- there's no one who doesn't.\"\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "In 2006, Ben Offrink manipulated a calculus-based physics study group to meet alone with Shelby, whom he had a crush on. Eight years later, in 2014, the couple from Caledonia, Michigan, were married with two young children when Shelby was diagnosed with an intramedullary glioblastoma, a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer lodged in her spine. Surgery removed 75% of the tumor, but a second spot grew worse, requiring broader radiation. Shelby lost feeling in her legs and became paralyzed from the belly button down. Meanwhile, Ben's Hodgkins lymphoma, which he had battled into remission 15 years prior, returned. Both Ben and Shelby underwent chemotherapy while raising their two young daughters. Friends and family provided critical support through fundraisers and care. In January 2015, Shelby's cancer reappeared in her brain, and she was given a six-month prognosis. Despite this, she and Ben remain determined to fight and are seeking clinical trials and advanced cancer treatments.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nBaltimore (CNN)The streets of Baltimore are calm once again. For the second night in a row, protesters peacefully dispersed Wednesday night after a 10 p.m. curfew meant to prevent riots that tore up the city two days earlier. Many wore T-shirts that said \"Black Lives Matter,\" demanding accountability for the death of Freddie Gray. While the Baltimore protesters remained calm, some of their counterparts across the country were not. More than 100 people were arrested in New York during a \"NYC Rise Up & Shut It Down With Baltimore\" rally Wednesday night, New York police said. And Denver police arrested 11 people for charges such as assaulting a police officer, robbery, resisting police, disobedience to lawful orders and obstructing roadways. All this comes as protesters demand to know what happened to Gray, who was arrested April 12 and suffered a severe spinal cord injury. He died one week later. Demonstrations are planned for Thursday in Cincinnati, CNN affiliate WXIX said. And a \"Philly is Baltimore\" protest will take place at Philadelphia City Hall, Philly.com said. Seattle, Portland, Oregon, and Oakland, California, are on tap for Friday, which is also May Day or International Workers Day -- often used to call attention to issues affecting the working class and minorities. More than 100 people arrested during the fracas in Baltimore this week were released Wednesday without charges, the state public defender's office said. Authorities either had to charge or release them within 48 hours of their arrests. \"We've come up on a time line,\" said Police Commissioner Anthony Batts. But, he added: \"We're not giving up on them. We're just going to follow up.\" Enya Baez-Ferreras, a student at Johns Hopkins University, joined in the protests Wednesday. She said the violence that marred Baltimore this week is not reflective of the city. \"Baltimore is not violent. We have been under a lot of duress, and the violence that erupted the other day is only in reaction to the years and decades of oppression, of police brutality, of harassment that many of the Baltimore residents have been under,\" she said. President Barack Obama denounced the \"violence, looting, destruction that we saw from a handful of individuals in Baltimore.\" \"There's no excuse for that,\" he said in an interview that aired Wednesday on \"The Steve Harvey Morning Show.\" Obama said his \"heart goes out\" to injured officers, and he praised police who he said \"showed appropriate restraint.\" But he also talked about the state of urban communities. \"If you send police officers into those situations where the drug trade is the primary economy and you say to them basically your job is to contain that and arrest kids and put them in jail, when those police officers know (it's not going to fix things), then it's not surprising you end up with a situation of enormous tension between those communities and those police officers,\" he said. Obama: Baltimore rioting 'hurts communities that are already suffering' The relative calm that took over Baltimore can be credited in part to peaceful protesters who formed human barricades between hot-tempered demonstrators and police, day and night. \"We show that we can police ourselves,\" said a man who stood for hours in what protesters called a \"unity line.\" \"We're about positivity here in Baltimore. It starts with us. This long line of people came out here because what we seen on TV (Monday night), we didn't like it.\" The city implemented a 10 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew for a one-week period that started Tuesday. Asked if she was considering lifting the curfew early, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake told CNN's Chris Cuomo she had not made a decision yet. \"We re-evaluate it on a daily basis,\" the mayor said Thursday morning. Many residents credited police for not overreacting after the curfew went into effect Tuesday night, setting the tone for peaceful dispersal. \"The police did a fantastic job tonight,\" one person commented on Twitter. \"Technically they could of arrested everyone at 10:01.\" Some 2,000 National Guardsmen and more than 1,000 police officers from across Maryland and neighboring states were assigned to the streets of Baltimore on Tuesday night, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said. Opinion: In Baltimore riots, 'our hearts were broken' While there was no major damage Wednesday, the recovery from Monday's destruction is far from over. Many saw their homes and vehicles damaged, their livelihoods in shambles. So residents like Cindy Oxendine took to the streets to sweep up rocks, glass and more, despite her aching back. The governor's office has started a website for those wanting to help Baltimore recover from this week's riots. \"We have received an outpouring of support from Marylanders and people all around the country who want to help get our beloved Baltimore back on its feet in the wake of the violence and destruction,\" Hogan said in a statement. The website, governor.maryland.gov/mdunites/, allows visitors to volunteer for cleanup efforts, donate to charities helping affected residents and report new incidents to police. Some leaders slam 'thug' as the new n-word. CNN's Brian Todd reported from Baltimore; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Evan Perez, Greg Botelho, Dana Ford and Diane Ruggiero contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 180 words:\nTikrit, Iraq (CNN)ISIS is gone, but the fear remains. As Iraqi forces, aided by Shiite militiamen, took control Wednesday of the northern city of Tikrit, they found vehicles laden with explosives and buildings that might be booby-trapped. CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon, who was in Tikrit on Tuesday, saw a large mechanical digger packed with explosives that Iraqi forces had to disarm. The troops, she said, were cautious when they entered buildings in case they were wired to explode. Plumes of smoke rose from burning buildings in the background. Near former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces compound -- Tikrit is Hussein's birthplace -- the CNN team also saw a destroyed truck with a large machine gun mounted on the back. Iraqi forces said they had fired an RPG at the truck, killing three ISIS fighters. ISIS was ejected from the palaces compound in fierce fighting, they said, adding that there may still be booby traps. Federal police said they dismantled hundreds of IEDs (improvised explosive devices) Wednesday. CNN heard at least 16 explosions, some very loud, which police said were controlled. The potential booby traps were political as well as physical. Officials are concerned about the behavior of the conquerors, particularly the Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen who helped Iraqi troops. Officials fear the militiamen might take \"scorched earth\" reprisals for the reported massacre of Shiite air force cadets by ISIS fighters in Tikrit last year. Much of the population of Tikrit is, like ISIS, Sunni Muslim. And officials fear that reprisals by Shiite militias against the Sunni population could stoke local anger, jeopardizing the government's ability to hold onto Tikrit and pull the country together. Sectarian resentment helped fuel the rise of ISIS in the first place. 'Where are our sons?' demand families of soldiers captured by ISIS. Still, the liberation of Tikrit from the terrorist group, which is also known as ISIL and calls itself the Islamic State, represented a significant victory for the Iraqi government, which had tried -- and failed -- to retake the city many times before. Iraqi  Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi arrived Wednesday to claim the victory, which took place a year after the city was first attacked by ISIS. Al-Abadi, who is also Iraq's top military commander, had announced the previous evening on Iraqiya TV that the city was under the control of Iraqi forces. Iraqi forces continued to clean out pockets of resistance Wednesday, said Interior Minister Mohammed al-Ghabban, who was also in the city. But he said the Iraqi government would be in full control shortly. \"The enemy has been defeated, and it has lost all its capabilities,\" al-Ghabban said. \"In the coming hours, the battle will end.\" Iraqi security said that the few ISIS militants left in the city are hiding inside houses hoping to escape in the dark. ISIS' nine-month dominion over Tikrit was marked by brutality. In addition to the reported massacre of the 1,500-plus air force cadets at Camp Speicher in June, ISIS is believed to have buried victims in mass graves and to have destroyed an Assyrian church that had graced Tikrit since the eighth century. The push into Tikrit came days after U.S.-led airstrikes targeted ISIS bases around the city. Al-Abadi said those tactics would now be replicated in other areas. Brett McGurk, the U.S. deputy special presidential envoy to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, tweeted that the coalition's airstrikes had destroyed numerous ISIS shelters. \"We will continue to support courageous Iraqi forces operating under Iraqi command as they work to reclaim their territory from #ISIL,\" McGurk tweeted. The key to victory in Tikrit this time, the Prime Minister said, was surprise. But help from the coalition of Shiite militiamen and volunteers also played a part. The militia members, estimated to number around 20,000, are backed by Iran. The offensive marked the first open participation of Iranian advisers on the front lines in Iraq. The victory in Tikrit sets the stage for Iraqi forces to take back an even bigger prize -- Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. A U.S. official said in February that up to 25,000 Iraqi troops plan to return to Mosul in April or May in an effort to retake the city. Don Melvin wrote this report in London. Arwa Damon and Hamdi Alkhshali reported from Tikrit and Jomana Karadsheh from Baghdad.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "ISIS was driven out of Tikrit, Iraq, on Wednesday, but Iraqi forces and officials expressed caution due to potential booby traps and fears of reprisals against the Sunni population by Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen. ISIS had controlled the city since June 2014 and was known for brutality, including the reported massacre of over 1,500 Shiite air force cadets. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who is also the country's top military commander, claimed victory and arrived in Tikrit to celebrate. Iraqi forces continued to search for remaining ISIS militants and dismantled hundreds of IEDs. The U.S.-led coalition provided aerial support with airstrikes on ISIS bases around the city. The victory in Tikrit sets the stage for a larger offensive to retake Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. Iranian advisers openly participated in the battle, marking the first time they have been on the front lines in Iraq. Officials hope to retake Mosul in April or May with up to 25,000 Iraqi troops.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nFerguson, Missouri (CNN)Change has come to Ferguson. After months of turmoil and upheaval, months of frustration and anger, the beleaguered city has a new governing board. And it looks very different than the old one. Buoyed by a higher-than-normal 30% turnout, two African-American candidates won their wards Tuesday night to make the six-member City Council 50% black. Ferguson's population of about 21,000 is 70% black, but the City Council was predominantly white, as is the police force. Supporters of both candidates said that from the tragedy of a young black man's death, a new day dawned in Ferguson. Ella Jones screamed when her victory became official late Tuesday night. She won 49.76% of the vote. \"Thank you, Ward 1. I love you,\" an emotional Jones said at a party held at Drake's restaurant. She will become the first black woman ever to sit on the Ferguson council. But both Jones and Wesley Bell, who won the Ward 3 seat with nearly 67% of the vote, said they did not see their victories from a racial perspective. Jones, who resigned her job as a Mary Kay cosmetics sales director to run for office, said in her ward, she heard the same complaints from a 65-year-old black man as she did from his white peers. \"My job is to be that catalyst so we can put a new face on Ferguson,\" she said. Bell, a lawyer and criminal justice professor, said, \"I'm more interested in having quality on the council,\" when asked about the change in its racial makeup. He had made community policing his No. 1 priority and said he intends to be deeply involved with the hiring of a new police chief in this St. Louis suburb. The former chief, Tommy Jackson, resigned after a scathing U.S. Department of Justice report found systemic discrimination against African-Americans in law enforcement and the municipal court. Bell said he wants Ferguson's police officers to be judged by the number of people they know in the community, not by the number of tickets they issue. One other seat was up for grabs in Ferguson. That was won by Brian Fletcher, a former mayor who launched the \"I Love Ferguson\" campaign to raise money for mom-and-pop businesses that were hurt by the violence and vandalism during the protests last fall. Fletcher beat his opponent, Bob Hudgins, with 56.7% of the vote. Fletcher told voters he was best suited for a City Council job despite his critics' claims that he was too entrenched in the old guard. \"I understand that feeling, but those individuals don't know me,\" he said. Fletcher said he had contacts with elected officials from his almost three decades in politics. That would be an invaluable asset in getting Ferguson back on its feet, he said. The city is required to approve a new budget by the end of June, and the new council will have to look for alternative sources of revenue to replace the $3 million or so lost from money generated by traffic tickets and fines. \"That amount will drop significantly,\" Fletcher said. Earlier in the day, the skies grew dark and the radio crackled with warnings of flash floods. Amid the rain, Ferguson opened its polls at 6 in the morning with concern that few would come out to vote in such a pivotal election. But Tuesday was different. It was the first city election since white police Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in August. There was dread, especially in the African-American community, that if the turnout was low, then all the protests, investigations and calls for change would have been in vain. The candidates who had run campaigns calling for change hoped a decent turnout would weigh in their favor. \"That is what our democracy about,\" Bell said. Bell ran against Lee Smith, a retired electrical plant employee, in Ward 3, which includes Canfield Drive, where Brown was killed, and the West Florissant Avenue business corridor that felt the brunt of the protests and the vandalism. Charred, heavily damaged buildings still stand as scars of Ferguson's despair and anger. \"You got your vote on?\" yelled Tommy Chatman Bey, a Bell supporter who was distributing campaign literature at Koch Elementary School, the precinct closest to where Brown lived. Some residents did have their vote on. They felt a duty to vote this year. One of them was Yvette Bailey, 41, who works as a planner for Coca-Cola. Yes, she voted in presidential elections, but she never paid much mind to local races. Until now. Even though she was aware of the problems around her, Brown's killing, she said, woke her up. \"It made me think of all the males in my family,\" said Bailey, who lives right off Canfield Drive. She was undecided about who to vote for until the last minute when she walked into the polling station with another voter and they discussed the race. Bailey decided to cast her vote for Bell simply because he was a young man. She thought he had energy and was more in sync with Ferguson's youth. \"I think he will be more open-minded,\" she said after voting. Changing the way Ferguson polices its people was No. 1 on many a voter's agenda. Even the candidates who take issue with the Department of Justice report on Ferguson agreed that the city needed change when it came to policing. \"We have to get out of this law enforcement for business,\" said candidate Doyle McClellan, coordinator of the computer network security program at Lewis and Clark Community College. McClellan referred to the DOJ's finding that Ferguson issued fines and traffic tickets to generate revenue for the city. \"That's not a good thing,\" McClellan said as he stood in the drizzle at a polling station, hoping to persuade voters who were still undecided. Ted Heidemann, a 67-year-old retired airline pilot, said he voted for Fletcher. If some residents saw Fletcher as part of the problem, Heidemann asked why no one complained when Fletcher was mayor. He said Brown's shooting brought a lot of bad things to light. \"We didn't realize the effect some of the institutional problems had on poor people,\" he said. \"Some things need to be changed, and we are aware of that.\" By midafternoon, Fletcher said the numbers were looking good. At a church where voters from all three wards were casting ballots, Fletcher predicted a 40%-50% turnout. When the rain let up for a few minutes, a stream of voters trickled into the First Presbyterian Church in downtown Ferguson to cast their votes. Ellory and Kathy Glenn both voted for Fletcher's opponent, Hudgins, a political novice who attracted attention as a white man who routinely stood with protesters on the front lines. Hudgins likes to talk about how he married a black woman and has a biracial teenage son. \"I wanted change,\" said Ellory Glenn, 60, who is black. His wife is white. He said the couple moved to Ferguson after he retired from the Marine Corps in 1995 because they felt it was a racially welcoming place. But now, after all the problems rose to the surface, it's time for fresh blood on the council, Glenn said. \"Quit using law enforcement as a revenue stream,\" Glenn said. \"That's like using the military to go into places and looting them. The police are supposed to keep order.\" Angela Jackson came to vote with her husband and two little girls in tow. She voted for Jones, the former Mary Kay cosmetics sales director. Jackson echoed the thoughts of other Ferguson residents who experienced something new in this election: candidates coming to their door. Past elections have not seen the kind of canvassing activity that took place in the last few weeks. Nor have past municipal elections drawn so much media attention. \"One thing we really liked is (Jones) came to our door and talked to us about her desire to make change in our neighborhood,\" Jackson said. \"She's going to be hands on. She lives in the neighborhood as well and has for the past 36 years. We were kind of taken by that.\" The rain began to fall again as the Glenns got in their car. It was expected to continue off and on through the day and night. But at about 5, just when many voters were leaving work, the sun shone brilliantly. Overheard at one precinct: Good weather brought out the worst in Ferguson last August. Maybe today, it would bring out the best.\n\noutput:",

But in his life, 50-year-old Walter Scott was also the father of four children and served in the Coast Guard before being honorably discharged. \"He was outgoing -- loved everybody, (was) very known in the community and got along with everybody,\" his brother Anthony Scott told CNN's Don Lemon. \"All the family loves him, and his kids loved him.\" Until it all came crashing down Saturday morning, when North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager pulled Scott over, reportedly for a faulty brake light. Dash cam video released Thursday shows the two talking, then shows Scott get out of his car and run. Why did he run? Justin Bamberg, a lawyer for Scott's family, speculated Thursday it could have been related to \"child support and a fear of maybe going back to (jail).\" At the time of his death, Scott owed over $18,000 in back payments for two children and hadn't made a payment since July 2012, according to Charleston County family court documents. Another family lawyer, Chris Stewart, acknowledged that Scott had been arrested previously for outstanding warrants for not paying child support, but Stewart said that had been Scott's lone issue with the law for the past 20 years. \"I know that it had nothing to do with anything violent,\" Bamberg said of Scott's legal history. \"He was not a dangerous person.\" According to a police report, Scott did not comply with an officer's demands and tried to grab Slager's stun gun. Slager fired eight shots, five of which struck Scott. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Regardless of why Walter Scott ran, \"running from an officer doesn't result in the death penalty,\" Stewart said. Slager has been charged with murder, a charge that might not have come about if not for a bystander's video of the shooting. Anthony Scott said he watched the video that showed his brother getting shot dead, footage that has traumatized the family. \"When I saw that video for the first time, my family was deeply hurt that someone would gun down a human being in that way,\" the brother said. \"We just couldn't believe it.\" The last time the family got together with Walter Scott was when the siblings threw a surprise wedding anniversary party for their parents. \"It was a great celebration,\" Anthony Scott said. \"My dad and brothers planned it, and (my mother) was totally surprised. \"Now this happens,\" Scott said, referring to his brother's shooting. \"It's so tragic.\" CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nLast month's so-so jobs numbers confirm the challenges our economy still faces. Despite recent gains, only 126,000 jobs were added, the lowest since December 2013. Wages remain sluggish. And unemployment may still be at 5.5%, but there is wide concern among labor experts and economists that too much job growth is in part-time low-income work. Low-wage workers have been the hardest hit since the onset of the financial crisis, and low-wage jobs remain a fixture of the new economy. Nearly 60% of the people in America's workforce are paid hourly and work part-time. Most part-time employees are doing low-wage work. Tackling this growing trend is complex. But there is a simple step we can take to improve the conditions of low-wage workers today. Congress should help low-wage workers gain access to predictable work schedules. Here is how this issue works:. America's major fast-food chains, retailers and department stores use \"just-in-time\" scheduling to maximize profit, which in turn creates unstable and stressful work environments for low-wage workers. This type of scheduling has increased dramatically because of sophisticated software that ties staffing to expected customer traffic. Algorithms, built on sales and economic data, provide real-time information for managers to make personnel adjustments. Not surprisingly, such haphazard scheduling wreaks havoc with low-wage workers. Hourly low-income workers endure significantly greater fluctuations in their hours and less predictability in how much they earn than full-time employees.  Many don't even know their weekly schedules until the last moment. A University of Chicago study found that 41% of early career hourly workers and 47% who work part-time received a week or less of notice of their work schedules. Imagine dealing with this as you are trying to earn a basic living, find reliable child care, get new vocational skills, or attend to medical needs. Women and workers of color most acutely struggle with this practice. Women comprise over two-thirds of the nearly 20 million workers in low-wage jobs like home health care, fast food work, and cash services. Similarly, a large proportion of minorities work low-wage jobs. Nearly 50% of African-Americans and Latinos receive their hours with a week or less notice. By comparison, almost 40%  of whites receive weekly notice. Minorities also have much less of an ability to control their hours. Only 10% of Latinos and 12% of black workers reported being able to set their hours within certain limits or freely. Within this same context, 18% of whites said they could. Child care is the primary casualty of just-in-time scheduling. Because of erratic shifts, child care centers often can't accommodate a working mother's schedule. Many must attend to informal arrangements, which by nature are unstable and unreliable. Traditional economic safeguards have offered little help to these workers. Unions, for example, have provided little protection against just-in-time scheduling because of their nascent role in the service economy. Real solutions exist. States and cities are enacting laws to address scheduling abuses. New York, Minnesota and Michigan previously introduced promising legislation. And in December, San Francisco became the first jurisdiction to pass a \"retail worker bill of rights.\" This ordinance limits how chain stores can alter their employees' schedules. Still, there is no substitute for federal action. Too many people work in states with little protection. Washington ignores the problem because congressional Republicans have shown little interest in the plight of low-wage workers. Last summer, The Schedules that Work Act was introduced in Congress. According to the National Women's Law Center, the bill would provide workers the right to request and receive predictable work schedules, receive compensation for sudden scheduling changes, and not fear retaliation if they request scheduling accommodations from their boss. Although the bill expired last session it will likely be reintroduced. And yet the bill will most likely not pass. Congressional Republicans have demonstrated they are more interested in unraveling worker protections under the guise of supporting economic growth. Conservatives should embrace this work-schedule legislation. The bill protects families and allows them to attend to their many obligations, not just work. Protecting shift workers is likewise good for business. Studies show that workers who exercise greater control over their hours are happier and more efficient. Conversely, just-in-time scheduling increases worker turnover and hurts worker satisfaction. While Washington stalls, it's everyday Americans who are hurt. It's the single mom in Chattanooga working as a Walmart cashier who's juggling work and childcare for her kids. It's the Arby's line cook in Fort Worth who needs reliable shifts to make her dialysis treatments. It's the stock man at an Amazon fulfillment center in Lehigh Valley who can't get his son to pre-algebra tutoring because of his erratic shifts. Our leaders have the unique responsibility to protect America and attend to the critical economic challenges of our time. Even with the weaker-than-expected jobs report we know our overall economy is improving, yet income-inequality is deepening. Congress must endorse a recovery that's inclusive, livable, and one that enables every family to balance competing obligations. They can start by passing legislation that better protects shift workers from arbitrary and unpredictable scheduling practices.\n\noutput:",

Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds, until the gunmen called them out. \"(The gunmen) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,\" Cheroitich told CNN. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" The 19-year-old student at Kenya's Garissa University College didn't see what happened next, but she heard more than enough. \"They were shooting everywhere,\" she said. \"I didn't want to open my eyes.\" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn't budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. \"I was scared so much,\" she recalled. Cheroitich's survival story, which she recounted to CNN on Saturday, is a rare bright spot in what has been a horrific week in Garissa, a town about 90 miles from the Somali border, and throughout Kenya. It is all due to Al-Shabaab, the Islamist extremist group that is based in Somalia but hasn't confined its terrorism to there -- as evidenced by Thursday's university attack and the 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming as it promised \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nadif Jama, the governor of Garissa county. \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Jama said. \"They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business.\" Jama said the militants were \"bent on nothing but destruction\" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. \"But that is something we need to fight,\" Jama said. Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing. A large crowd gathered, despite the baking sun and foul stench. The truck drove up next to the onlookers, so that they could inspect the bodies. Anger seethed in the crowd. \"These gunmen, they killed innocent children. We want to burn these people,\" one man told CNN. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab, as well as any those who supported them. Five arrested in Kenya attack. In a nationally televised speech, Kenyatta said the nation's fight against terrorism \"has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary, harmless people.\" Kenyatta condemned \"corruption of the worst and most criminal kind (when) Kenyans ... finance, hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab.\" \"There is no form of legal penalty, social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve, to the fullest extent,\" the President said. Describing Al-Shabaab as an \"existential threat to our republic,\" Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to \"tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible, sovereign and democratic state.\" \"That fight will never change,\" he added. \"Our forefathers bled and died for this nation. And we will do everything to defend our way of life.\" Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the attack. Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter.

Cynthia Cheroitich, a 19-year-old student, survived by hiding in a closet and drinking body lotion when the gunmen entered her dorm room. The militants separated students based on their ability to recite Muslim verses, and shot those who couldn't. Cheroitich remained hidden for two days until police arrived. Al-Shabaab, an Islamist extremist group based in Somalia, claimed responsibility for the attack and threatened more violence. Garissa County Governor Nadif Jama condemned the group and urged unity among Muslims and non-Muslims. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta called Al-Shabaab an \"existential threat\" and declared three days of national mourning. Five suspects were arrested in connection to the attack.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 186 words:\nA Florida judge denied a motion by two women to join a lawsuit against Prince Andrew and a prominent U.S. lawyer that alleged  underage sex crimes. Lawyer Alan Dershowitz  was accused of having sex with minors with help from billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Buckingham Palace denied the allegations, which surfaced in a court filing in January. So did Dershowitz. In his decision, U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth Marra denied a motion by the alleged victims -- \"Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4\" -- to join a lawsuit accusing the federal government of violating their rights by negotiating a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without consulting them. Marra wrote in the decision that the \"lurid details\" of alleged abuse were unnecessary to determining whether the victims could join the lawsuit. \"The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent to this central claim ... especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken.\" Speaking of the allegations against him, Dershowitz said Tuesday: \"I hope that people will now understand that they were completely false and made up, and, nobody should believe them.\" Buckingham Palace, which in January emphatically denied any form of sexual contact between the Duke of York and a victim it identified as Virginia Roberts,  said Prince Andrew was informed of the latest developments. \"He is spending this week privately, before resuming his schedule of public engagements next week. Further details will be announced in due course,\" the palace said in a statement. Roberts' attorneys were not immediately available for comment. The federal court filing alleged that \"Doe 3\" was forced to have sex with several men when she was a teenager. Virginia Roberts made the allegations in a civil motion filed earlier this year in U.S. District Court in southern Florida, joined by another unnamed woman. While Roberts was not identified by name in the filing, her name was widely reported in the British news media, and Buckingham Palace included it in a statement. Along with Britain's Prince Andrew and others, Dershowitz was named in the federal court filing as one of the prominent people who had sexual contact with teenage girls through Epstein. Epstein, an investment banker, pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation, but there were no federal charges after he and authorities signed a non-prosecution agreement. But some of Epstein's alleged victims aren't on board with the deal, thinking he should face stiffer charges and penalties. Four of them took federal prosecutors to court, suing them to reopen the case because they believed their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act were violated by the agreement. Two of them entered the discussion in January, including the one described as Jane Doe 3. The filing alleged she was a minor when Epstein made her a \"sex slave\" and made \"her available for sex to politically connected and financially powerful people.\" Those big names allegedly included Prince Andrew and Dershowitz. According to the filing, \"Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\" The celebrity lawyer and professor subsequently issued an adamant public denial, saying the case \"is all about money\" and \"completely made up.\" He went further in his court filings, including a sworn affidavit in which he said \"lawyers for Jane Doe #3 ... leveled totally false and outrageous charges against me that have been reported around the world and threaten to damage my reputation irrevocably.\" \"Never under any circumstance have I ever had any sexual contact of any kind, which includes massages or any physical contact whatsoever, with Jane Doe #3,\" he said. Dershowitz said, for instance, that his wife and daughter accompanied him on his sole visit to Epstein's Caribbean island as well as the one time he went to Epstein's New Mexico house -- at which point it was under construction and no girls were visible. \"Let me assert categorically, without reservation and with full awareness of the risks of perjury,\" he stated, \"that I did not ever, under any circumstances, have any sexual contact of any kind with Jane Doe #3.\" CNN's Greg Botelho, Steve Almasy, Javier de Diego, Josh Levs contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

Derrius Tolson now faces two counts of first-degree involuntary manslaughter as the details of the deadly crash come to light.\nThe incident unfolded on a fateful Saturday, October 14th, when Tolson sped through a red light at the exit ramp for southbound I-435. A patrolling Kansas City Police officer had noticed that Tolson's Jeep was in a reckless chase or race with another vehicle, leading to this tragedy.\nTolson's Jeep was hurtling at an estimated speed of 92 to 94 mph within a 40 mph zone when it collided with a Honda Accord, sending the Jeep tumbling multiple times. While Tolson survived the crash with minor injuries, his girlfriend, identified as Deja Perkins, was tragically pronounced dead at the scene. The couple's 2-year-old daughter, who was ejected from the vehicle, was found lifeless in the grass nearby.\nRemarkably, the driver of the Honda emerged without apparent injuries. She recounted hearing a deafening crash and seeing a vehicle overturning to her right just before the impact.\nAnother witness, driving a Penske Ford 350 van, confirmed that the blue Dodge Challenger, linked to the fatal race, collided with the van before the disaster. It became evident that the vehicles were racing against each other.\nTolson disclosed that he had been driving his family to the pumpkin patch. Just an hour before the accident, he had dropped off his stepdaughter. The fatal encounter with the racing vehicles took place when they encountered a mysterious Chrysler 300 with no license plate and tinted windows.\nTolson recounted that the driver of the Chrysler seemed to challenge him at a traffic intersection. Feeling threatened and surrounded by the Chrysler, he accelerated in an attempt to distance himself. Unfortunately, the risky move led to the tragic flip-over of his Jeep. Tolson admitted to running a red light before the collision.\nThe authorities also discovered a loaded firearm and a backpack containing marijuana and scales near the crash site. Tolson confessed that these items belonged to him, and he had been using marijuana recreationally.\nTolson currently remains in custody on a $500,000 bond. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and additional charges could follow as the tragic consequences of his high-speed drive continue to be revealed.\noutput:",

Warm fall days usually start with some low clouds and fog and we saw that in a few places this morning. Satellite loops and radar loops are nice and quiet and we will have sunshine all day long. Temperatures will rise to the lower 80s in most places today. There are no weather issues as far as rain is concerned and that will be the case probbaly into the first part of Friday\nTonight we will be warm and there will be some patchy low clouds and fog. Warm Wednesday morning lows will be in the 50s inland and low to mid 60s in warmer urban locations. Wednesday will be the warmest day of this stretch with sunshine taking highs up to the low and middle 80s and a few places could possibly set record high temperatures for the day.\nYou will likely notice humidity levels going up over the next few days especially as the wind turns more southeast with time. That will start to impact temperatures some beginning Thursday. We will probably have clouds to start the day with the long nights producing low clouds and fog, and then developing sunshine taking highs to the mid and upper 70s.\nA cold front will approach Friday as low pressure moves east across the Great Lakes and into Southeastern Canada. The front will be slowing down as it heads east and this is going to be due to Tropical Storm Philippe which will be moving up the east coast offshore. Philippe will be headed possibly for Nova Scotia over the weekend so the front slows until the tropical cyclone moves northward and then swing through the Eastern US Friday night and Saturday.\nFriday we will see arriving clouds and perhaps a couple of scattered showers during the day. Friday highs will be in the mid to upper 70s. Showers and a few thunderstorms will become more numerous overnight into Saturday and it looks like we will have to wait until late in the day Saturday for a front to pass and for showers to end. Saturday highs will be in the upper 60s to around or just over 70. The front moves offshore and then we see the arrivial of much cooler air and also the beginning of what will be a new pattern for next week and beyond. Sunday will be colder with clouds and some sun along with the chance for an instability shower. Highs will just be in the upper 50s and lower 60s. Next week we could see at least a few days where daytime highs do not get out of the 50s.\noutput:",

Miami is certainly going to have some serious questions and decisions to make regarding their cap situation in the future, but if they were willing to sign Indianapolis Colts running back Jonathan Taylor to a lucrative contract, they certainly could do so with Young, and perhaps it may be a bit cheaper.\nBringing Young to a rush that includes Wilkins, Zach Sieler, Jaelen Phillips, and Bradley Chubb would certainly boost the line's potency as they prepare for a playoff push.\nMiami has struggled generating sacks this season, so adding Young would go a long way into boosting that number, and helping other areas of the defense as well.\noutput:",

However, acquiring him would require signing him to a long-term extension and addressing the team's cap situation.

This year, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is taking a fresh approach with their \"Wild to Mild\" campaign. Using animals as metaphors, the campaign highlights the vaccine's ability to weaken the flu's ferocity, transforming it from a roaring lion to a gentle kitten:\nWhile many have been conditioned to think of vaccines in binary terms—either they prevent illness or they don't—the reality is more intricate.\nDr. Sarah Bauerle Bass, a health communication expert at Temple University, points out that while some vaccines, like those for measles and polio, offer near-complete protection, the flu vaccine operates differently. This is primarily because the flu virus is a master of disguise, constantly evolving and presenting new challenges for our immune defenses.\nUnlike the static nature of measles or polio, the flu is a dynamic adversary. It's a collection of viruses, and the vaccine typically targets only a select few strains. These strains are chosen based on predictions from the Southern Hemisphere's flu activity, a method that, while scientifically grounded, isn't foolproof.\nTo the casual observer, the flu vaccine might seem less effective, with protection rates hovering between 40-60% during well-matched seasons. This has led to a pervasive myth that the vaccine is subpar. However, this perspective misses the broader picture as the vaccine's primary goal isn't just to prevent infection but to mitigate the severe consequences of the flu.\nSo, while the vaccine might not always prevent a runny nose, it's adept at shielding vital organs from the virus, reducing hospitalizations and saving lives. The \"Wild to Mild\" initiative aims to recalibrate public understanding, emphasizing the vaccine's role in transforming a potentially lethal illness into a more manageable one.\nHowever, the public's relationship with vaccines has evolved over the decades. Dr. Howard Markel, a medical historian, notes that while vaccines were once celebrated as miraculous gifts, modern perceptions are more varied and, at times, skeptical. This skepticism has extended to the COVID vaccine, which, like the flu vaccine, has faced misconceptions about its efficacy.\nDespite these challenges, the CDC remains optimistic. While not everyone will choose to get vaccinated, the goal is to reach the undecided majority with compelling messaging. The \"Wild to Mild\" campaign encapsulates the essence of the flu vaccine: it might not be perfect, but it's a powerful tool we have right now.\noutput:",

Now he is feeling the pressure of handling the migrant crisis in his own city. Last week, he voiced his concerns over the migrant crisis in his own City.\nSince Texas began bussing migrants to Denver last December, former Mayor Michael Hancock was in charge to handle the arrival and their support.\nGovernor Jared Polis was planning to bus migrants to the sanctuary cities of Chicago and New York City. Both mayors complained and the plan to bus them there ended.\nNow that Mayor Johnston is running the City, he was interviewed by CNN on October 6 to discuss the currency situation and the 23,390 migrants the City supports.\nMayor Johnson said in the interview according to Denver 7:\n“They’re not asking for help. They’re not asking for charity. What they want is just the chance that everyone wants, to chase the American Dream and be able to work.”\n“We have people here who want to work, we have employers who want to hire them, we have a Congress who stood in the way of their ability to do that. I think that's the biggest challenge we see right now.”\n“We know if people are here without work authorization, we are going to need more federal support to support them. But our focus is really trying to get them access to work.”\n“We think if you bring someone to the country and tell them they can't work, there's no choice but to either encourage them to break the law or to make them survive on public subsidy and we think neither of those are good options.”\nIn addition, Denver sent letters to border town officials asking migrants not to come to the City.

That pass, the Disney Pixie Dust Pass, will now cost Sunshine State residents $439 ($21.88 per month excluding taxes), a $40 increase. Meanwhile, for park goers who want a more inclusive experience in the parks, the Disney Incredi-Pass, their highest-tiered pass, went up by $50, from $1,449 to $1,449 (or $111.52 per month).\nParking at the House of the Mouse will also be a little more expensive. Prices at Walt Disney World will increase $5, to $30, which, according to UPI News, will bring its parking prices more in line with Orlando’s other giant theme park resorts. To make up for the increase in ticket prices, the company is bringing back All Day Park Hopper Access to annual pass holders.\nAccording to its Disney Parks blog, starting on January 9th, annual pass holders will now be able to visit any of Disney World’s parks at any time of the day during operating hours. Currently, Park Hopper Access is only available after 2 p.m. Other changes being made for annual passholders include a return to complimentary self-parking at all Disney World Resort hotels, and the return of parking trams, which were halted during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe raise in ticket and parking prices comes as The Walt Disney Company is preparing to spend over $60 billion in its parks over the next 10 years, which also includes the company’s overseas theme parks and the Disney Cruise Line.\nArticle by Kareem Gantt\noutput:",

That is the preeminent program to be able to say that you battled against, so I feel good about that. Obviously I want the win, however, when you put a team like that against the ropes, that's a win in and of itself.”\nNantucket hung right with the Red Hawks in the first two sets. Set one was tied 15-15 and then 20-20, but Barnstable finished with a 5-1 run to take the set 25-21.\nLate in set two, the Whalers won five out of six points to pull with 23-21, forcing a Red Hawks timeout. The team would trade the final three points and Barnstable won the set 25-22 before closing out the match with a 25-15 third set.\nDespite sharing the same final score, Viselli said Monday’s match was a big step up for Nantucket from its first match against the Red Hawks earlier this season.\n“It was night and day,” Viselli said. “We went into their gym and we were afraid, we were tense. You can’t even say that we played when we went to Barnstable. The aura, the mystique, the fans, everything, they just played scared. This time they were like ‘we're here to play’ and they played and they just came up short.”\nNow 10-7 on the year, Nantucket will wrap up the regular season this week with matches Wednesday at Sturgis East and Friday at home against St. John Paul II.\noutput:",

Because this time, the independent is going to win,” he said, according to CNN.\nWhile no independent candidate has ever come close to winning the presidency, some have attracted enough support to affect the outcome of the election. In 2000, Ralph Nader’s independent candidacy may have allowed George W. Bush to defeat Al Gore, some observers have said.\nKennedy is the son of Robert Kennedy, who ran for the Democratic nomination in 1968, but who was assassinated after winning the California primary in June,\nDodgers on the brink of elimination\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers, who won the National League West title this season by a mile, now have their backs to the wall in the NL Division Series after losing 4-2 on Monday at home to the Arizona Diamondbacks.

He struck out four, walked one and yielded a home run to J.D. Martinez.\nWeather: Turnaround coming\nThe cooling trend that’s hit our West Orange County area will reverse itself soon.

I couldn't be happier,” coach Andrew Viselli said. “They fought, they played against a really good team and their coach thinks they're going to win a state championship.”\nThe match started on a high note for Nantucket as captain Vicky Todorova earned the 1,000th kill of her varsity career early in the opening set. The Whalers took 6-1 leads to begin the first two sets but couldn’t hold on to the momentum in either set and dropped them 25-20 and 26-24.\nAlice O’Banion stepped up with several key blocks in the middle and Bianca Santos had a string of strong serves to help Nantucket get back in the match and win sets three and four 25-21 and 26-24 before the wheels came off for the Whalers in the final set.\n“15-1, that’s just a drubbing,” Viselli said. “That’s indicative of the mindset of teams. (D-Y coach Dru Sisson) has played three or four five-setters already where they’ve lost the first two sets and come back and won the remaining three. It just speaks to where both teams are. They’re tested against big time teams over and over and over again because she puts them in that situation.”\nThe Whalers are now 9-5 on the season and will be back at home Thursday to host Sturgis East for the first of two matches with the Navigators this season.\noutput:",

The Officer gave chase and detained the subject.\nThe victim who had possessed the flag signed for a citizen’s arrest, resulting in a citation being issued, said Kushner.\nPhotographer Amy Katz attended the rally and shared her perspective in this Op-Ed posted on edhat. Katz stated the protestor also pushed the man holding the flag.

Israel says at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians, have been killed since Hamas launched the attack from the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian territory it has controlled for years.\nThe U.S. State Department says 32 Americans are known to have been killed, and 11 U.S. citizens remain unaccounted for, some reportedly taken hostage.\nPalestinian health officials say about 3,800 people, including hundreds of children, have been killed by Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza, and at least 12,500 more wounded.\noutput:",

Brought up by her grandmother and deeply bonded with her aunt and elder sister, Shantavia, Jasmine had a radiant personality. Her prowess on the basketball court during her high school years earned her the nickname “Beezy,” which stuck even into her adult life. A church choir singer with an infectious sense of humor, she was a beacon of happiness to those around her.\n2018 brought a new chapter to Jasmine's life when she learned she was expecting a baby. Eagerly looking forward to motherhood, she had chosen the name \"Jamillia\" for her soon-to-be-born daughter. However, fate had different plans, and in a twist of events, Jasmine mysteriously disappeared in 2019, while she was seven months into her pregnancy.\nOn the evening of February 18, 2019, after being dropped home by her grandmother, Jasmine was alone. It's unclear where her grandmother headed, but something had perturbed Jasmine that day, though she refrained from discussing it with anyone. Later that night, during a seemingly routine phone call with her aunt, Jasmine gave no hint of any distress. They made plans for her prenatal checkup the next day.\nHowever, when the time came, Jasmine was nowhere to be found. Calls to her went unanswered, and it soon became evident that something was amiss. Growing increasingly anxious, her family reported her missing on February 20th.\nDisturbingly, in the days leading up to her disappearance, Jasmine had confided in her sister Shantavia about unwelcome attention she was receiving from her unborn child's father. His insistent calls at her workplace and on her personal phone were unsettling to Jasmine. He didn’t seem supportive of the pregnancy, but Jasmine was determined to embrace motherhood, regardless of his views.\nThe police investigation hinted at Jasmine not being alone when she last left her grandmother’s home. Indications suggest that her departure wasn't of her own volition. Adding to the mystery, all her personal belongings, including essentials like her purse, remained untouched at her home. While authorities have questioned several individuals, it remains unknown if the baby's father has been cleared of suspicion.\nThe quest to uncover the truth about Jasmine Robinson and her unborn child remains ongoing. Today, were she with us, Jasmine would be celebrating her 27th birthday. Anyone with potentially valuable information is urged to reach out to the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office at 352–367–4083. A reward of $10,000 awaits credible leads.\noutput:",

As we have said, where the challenged law ‘makes clear that [another agency] is the agency responsible for the [law’s] administration and enforcement,’ only that agency is a proper defendant under Ex parte Young.”\nHe also added:\n“[E]ven assuming the governor has directed DPS to pull over plaintiffs via this executive order, that instruction is in the past. DPS alone will enforce the order in the future.”\nHear what Governor Abbott said two years ago on the executive order:\nThis is good news for Governor Abbott who continues to send migrants to sanctuary cities as they overwhelm border cities such as El Paso, Del Rio, Brownsville, and other cities.\nAccording to a press release, Governor Abbott has bussed over 60,000 migrants to sanctuary cities.\nOver 12,500 migrants to Washington, D.C. since April 2022\nOver 21,800 migrants to New York City since August 2022\nOver 17,200 migrants to Chicago since August 2022\nOver 3,200 migrants to Philadelphia since November 2022\nOver 5,100 migrants to Denver since May 18\nOver 1,000 migrants to Los Angeles since June 14\nGovernor Abbott is also challenging President Biden over allowing illegal immigrants in Texas which you can find out more here.\nDo you think this was a victory for Governor Abbott?\noutput:",

On Sunday, November 5th, at 2 a.m. local time, our clocks will be turned back by an hour, granting us an additional hour of sleep. This is part of the regular biannual time adjustment that has an impact on most, but not all, Americans.In the following year, on 2024, daylight saving time will commence again in March, causing us to move our clocks forward and lose one hour of sleep. The purpose behind gaining an hour in November, rather than losing one in the spring, is to make room for more daylight in the mornings. Conversely, when we \"spring forward\" in March, the intention is to extend daylight during the summer evenings. It is worth mentioning that in the Northern Hemisphere, the autumnal equinox occurred on September 23rd, signifying the commencement of the fall season. Daylight saving time is a biannual occurrence that impacts most Americans, whether they are ready for it or not.\nOn November 5th, our clocks are set backward by an hour, providing us with an additional hour of rest. This adjustment is designed to allow for more daylight in the mornings during the fall and winter seasons. However, it is important to note that not all Americans are affected by this time change, as there are some states and territories that do not observe daylight saving time.Looking ahead to 2024, daylight saving time will once again take place in March, resulting in us losing an hour of sleep. This shift is focused on extending daylight during the summer evenings, as we \"spring forward\" our clocks. It is interesting to consider the timing of these time adjustments in relation to the autumnal equinox, which occurred on September 23rd in the Northern Hemisphere, marking the beginning of the fall season. As we approach daylight saving time, it is important for individuals to be aware of these changes and adjust their schedules accordingly to minimize any disruptions in their daily routines.\nSource:\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/10/02/daylight-saving-time-2023/70971436007/\noutput:",

A few reports also came from North Dakota and as far south as Omaha, Nebraska.\nUnlike past Earthbound CMEs that hit early this year and were heavily reported about, this one had slower solar wind speeds and wasn't projected to be as strong. The overall weak nature of this CME caused many Aurora hunters who watch the charts to signal the arrival of the CME hitting Earth to miss it since the spike we are so used to seeing was not present in this setup.\nInstead, the only other hints that the Northern Lights might be present this time around and the arrival of the CME was a gap in the data from the satellites as the CME hit them, an ever so subtle increase in the solar winds, and a gradual decrease in the Bz values (Negative Bz), which means the solar energy is aligning with Earth's magnetic field favoring better odds the lights can be seen further south in the United States. Something Charlie Bourdo caught hours before the event unfolded Friday night!\nDo you want to learn more about the Northern Lights and how to forecast them better?

The lack of a prominent spike in data from satellites and subtle increases in solar winds and decreasing Bz values signaled the event.

According to a document received by Military Times, the medal's eligibility has been renewed retroactive to January 1 and will continue through December 31, 2024.\nU.S. Central Command requested the adjustment, according to Defense Department spokesman Nicole Schwegman, \"due to Iraq no longer being classified as a combat mission.\"\nAlthough the award was created in 2016 to recognize service in either Iraq or Syria, the requirements for the medal were revised in 2017 to restrict eligibility to only those who have served in Syria.\nThere has been a rise in hostile actions against American troops in the Middle East, notwithstanding Schwegman's assertion that the reinstatement of the award for troops in Iraq was not prompted by the recent intensification of drone operations there.\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin briefed senators on Capitol Hill this morning on the Pentagon's plans to fight such actions and the escalating tensions in the region.\n\"Our personnel have been under frequent attack in recent days by Iranian-backed paramilitary groups. \"These assaults have got to stop,\" he said. U.S. forces, acting on the president's orders, have carried out targeted self-defense strikes against Iranian IRGC and allied targets in eastern Syria. We will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to safeguard our people if Iranian-backed militants continue to attack U.S. forces.\nAs combat escalates between Israel and the Islamist group Hamas, the United States is sending more troops and resources to the Middle East, where they will join the roughly 2,500 already stationed in Iraq and the 900 already stationed in Syria.\nEdited by Newsbreak Contributor Denys Shybinskiy\noutput:",

But both admitted to being sleep when he escaped, VADOC said.\nAdditionally, the investigation found that Roulack was wearing nylon flex cuffs on his wrists and legs when he escaped.\nHe had been wearing flex cuffs on his wrists but metal cuffs on his legs when the hospital requested to do an MRI. The metal leg cuffs were then replaced by flex cuffs for the procedure. According to VADOC, the metal leg cuffs should have been reapplied afterward, but they weren’t.\n“The two officers chose to resign from the VADOC in lieu of termination. The officers officially left employment with the VADOC on August 23,” the department stated.\nAfter his escape from the hospital, Roulack was implicated in a Montgomery County, MD armed carjacking and kidnapping incident prompting that County to deem him wanted and offer a $10,000 reward.\nMontgomery County’s reward paired with a reward from the U.S. Marshals service brought the total offered for Roulack to $20,000. In yesterday’s announcement from VADOC, there was no mention of whether anyone was eligible to claim any of the reward funds.\nWhen Roulack escaped, he was serving a 13-year sentence at Greensville Correctional Center for aggravated malicious wounding, grand larceny and hit and run. VADOC also did not state where he currently is or if he would be returned to that facility.\nVADOC said this is still an active investigation, and the department was not releasing additional information at this time.\n***\nFollow theWatchful Eye on TwitterandFacebookto keep up with what's happening in Virginia!\nDid You See: VADOC Staffer Arrested for Contraband at Sussex Prison?\noutput:",
