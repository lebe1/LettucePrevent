    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 116 words:\nSeventy years ago, Anne Frank died of typhus in a Nazi concentration camp at the age of 15. Just two weeks after her supposed death on March 31, 1945, the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where she had been imprisoned was liberated -- timing that showed how close the Jewish diarist had been to surviving the Holocaust. But new research released by the Anne Frank House shows that Anne and her older sister, Margot Frank, died at least a month earlier than previously thought. Researchers re-examined archives of the Red Cross, the International Training Service and the Bergen-Belsen Memorial, along with testimonies of survivors. They concluded that Anne and Margot probably did not survive to March 1945 -- contradicting the date of death which had previously been determined by Dutch authorities. In 1944, Anne and seven others hiding in the Amsterdam secret annex were arrested and sent to the  Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Anne Frank's final entry. That same year, Anne and Margot were separated from their mother and sent away to work as slave labor at the Bergen-Belsen camp in Germany. Days at the camp were filled with terror and dread, witnesses said. The sisters stayed in a section of the overcrowded camp with no lighting, little water and no latrine. They slept on lice-ridden straw and violent storms shredded the tents, according to the researchers. Like the other prisoners, the sisters endured long hours at roll call. Her classmate, Nannette Blitz, recalled seeing Anne there in December 1944: \"She was no more than a skeleton by then. She was wrapped in a blanket; she couldn't bear to wear her clothes anymore because they were crawling with lice.\" Listen to Anne Frank's friends describe her concentration camp experience. As the Russians advanced further, the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp became even more crowded, bringing more disease. A deadly typhus outbreak caused thousands to die each day. Typhus is an infectious disease caused by lice that breaks out in places with poor hygiene. The disease causes high fever, chills and skin eruptions. \"Because of the lice infesting the bedstraw and her clothes, Anne was exposed to the main carrier of epidemic typhus for an extended period,\" museum researchers wrote. They concluded that it's unlikely the sisters survived until March, because witnesses at the camp said the sisters both had symptoms before February 7. \"Most deaths caused by typhus occur around twelve days after the first symptoms appear,\" wrote  authors Erika Prins and Gertjan Broek. The exact dates of death for Anne and Margot remain unclear. Margot died before Anne. \"Anne never gave up hope,\" said Blitz, her friend. \"She was absolutely convinced she would survive.\" Her diary endures as one of the world's most popular books.

The coroner's preliminary assessment is there was no foul play involved in the death of Getty, grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, said Detective Meghan Aguilar. Andrew Getty, 47, had \"several health issues,\" Aguilar said, adding that an autopsy will be conducted. There is no criminal investigation underway, he said. Some medication had also been recovered from Getty's home, though investigators don't know whether Getty was taking it or what his medical history was, Ed Winter, assistant chief in the Los Angeles County coroner's office, told CNN affiliate KTLA Tuesday night. KTLA reported that Getty was found on his side near a bathroom in his home. Getty's parents, Ann and Gordon Getty, released a statement confirming their son's death and asking for privacy. Where the Getty family fortune came from. Gordon Getty is one of three living sons of J. Paul Getty, the oil baron who was thought to be the richest man in the world at the time of his death in 1976. Gordon Getty, 81, has a net worth of $2.1 billion, according to Forbes. One other son died in 1958 and another died in 1973. Gordon Getty spearheaded the controversial sale of Getty to Texaco for $10 billion in 1984. In its list of richest American families, Forbes estimated the Gettys' net worth to be about $5 billion. Court records show Andrew Getty had recently filed to get a restraining order against an ex-girlfriend. A hearing in the case had been scheduled for next week. In his request, Getty said he had been diagnosed with a serious medical condition in 2013. \"A rise in my blood pressure places me in grave risk of substantial and irreparable injury or death,\" he wrote in the petition. \"My doctors have advised that heated arguments can cause my blood pressure to rise dangerously.\" Andrew Getty had three brothers and three half-sisters.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 98 words:\nSince Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, women have been barred from attending most sports events involving men. But the situation appears set to improve in the coming months after a top Iranian sports official said that the ban will be lifted for some events. A plan to allow \"women and families\" to enter sports stadiums will come into effect in the next year, Deputy Sports Minister Abdolhamid Ahmadi said Saturday, according to state-run media. But it isn't clear exactly which games women will be able to attend. According to the state-run Press TV, Ahmadi said the restrictions would be lifted for indoor sports events. The rules won't change for all matches because some sports are mainly related to men and \"families are not interested in attending\" them, Press TV cited him as saying. Iranian authorities imposed the ban on women attending men's sports events after the revolution, deeming that mixed crowds watching games together was un-Islamic. During the ensuing decades, the crowds at soccer games, Iran's most popular sport, have been all male. Iranian women were briefly permitted to attend volleyball matches under the moderate President Mohammad Khatami, but the ban was reinstated in 2005 after the more hard-line Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to power. The Iranian government has come under pressure from international sports officials over the restrictions. FIFA President Sepp Blatter called on Iran last month to end its \"intolerable\" ban on women attending soccer matches, saying the situation \"cannot continue.\" Iran had been in the running to host the 2019 edition of soccer's Asian Cup, but the tournament was awarded to the United Arab Emirates. The ban on women attending matches was widely seen as a major impediment to Iran's chances of securing the event. The ban came under the spotlight at the Asian Cup in Australia earlier this year, when thousands of female Iranian fans watched their soccer team without restriction. During the match against Iraq, activists called for the ban to end and unfurled a banner showing the face of Ghoncheh Ghavami, a British-Iranian woman detained in Iran last year while trying to watch a volleyball match. Iranian officials have denied that Ghavami was arrested for attending the volleyball game, saying she was taken into custody for \"anti-Iran activities.\" The news agency Reuters reported that she was recently pardoned by the Court of Appeal.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nIt's the kind of thing you see in movies, like Robert Redford's role in \"All Is Lost\" or Ang Lee's \"Life of Pi.\" But, in real life, it's hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days, weeks, if not months and somehow living to talk about it. Miracles do happen, though, and not just in Hollywood. We're not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the U.S. Coast Guard. Much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they'd brought aboard, if any. In order to survive, they can't bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city, town or boat -- but instead must rely on ingenuity, resourcefulness and luck. It's hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly, with a sailor dying at sea, except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues. Such happy endings do occur -- given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says, a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts. Below are a few recent examples:. Louis Jordan says that he set off on his 35-foot sailboat from South Carolina in late January. He headed into the Gulf Stream looking for a good spot to catch fish. And then everything -- his boat, his life -- turned upside down. Rescued man says he is 'utterly thankful' Not only did his boat capsize, but its mast broke, Jordan said. And so, too, did his shoulder. He bought time by rationing water, then collecting fresh water in a bucket. As to food, Jordan says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish. And he rigged a makeshift mast and sail. But, Jordan said, \"It took so long. It moved so slowly.\" His sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a German-flagged container ship, the Houston Express, spotted Jordan about 200 miles off the North Carolina coast on Thursday. After their reunion, his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads. \"I thought I lost you.\" Jose Salvador Alvarenga says his journey began in Paredon Viejo, a port on Mexico's Pacific coast, in late 2012. The exact date is up for debate -- he says he set off in December, locals say it was November. But what's not in doubt is that, after he left, he disappeared. Until January 2013. That's when Alvarenga interacted with humans once again, thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the Marshall Islands. Castaway recounts how he survived over a year adrift in Pacific. What was supposed to be a one-day trip, he says, turned into an arduous odyssey across the Pacific Ocean, one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive. His nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course. Then a storm hit causing their boat, which was about three people long and one wide, to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and GPS systems. Four weeks in, Alvarenga said his partner -- 23-year-old Ezequiel Cordova, according to the boat's owner -- died because he refused to eat raw birds. The days, weeks and months ran together after that. Alvarenga says he drank rainwater and, when there wasn't any available, his own urine. He ate sea turtles. Then, after 13 or 14 months adrift, he and his small, heavily damaged boat arrived on the Ebon Atoll, about a 22-hour boat ride from the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro. The atoll has one phone line, no Internet service and a few residents, two of whom Alvarenga spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods. The El Salvador native told CNN that his faith in God helped him survive. \"I thought, 'I am going to get out,\" he said. \"Get out, get out, get out.\" Some in their late 60s might relax in their retirement, reining it in a few notches as life slows down. And if you live in Hawaii, there's even more reason to take it easy. The thing is: Ron Ingraham isn't one of those people. He's a fisherman. The sea is both his life and livelihood, his son, Zakary, told CNN. And he's tough, with his son jokingly comparing him to Rambo. Still, even the hardiest fishermen would have been tested by what Ron Ingraham went through after setting off around last Thanksgiving solo from the Hawaiian island of Molokai. Son vindicated as father rescued after 12 days at sea. After bad weather hit, Ron Ingraham told CNN affiliate KHNL/KGMB that his 25-foot sailboat went \"backwards all night long.\" At one point, a huge wave struck -- pushing his mast into the water and him as well. The 67-year-old used a rope to pull himself back in. But his boat couldn't be rescued so easily, leaving him at the mercy of the current. A distress call went out, prompting a search that would cover 12,000 square miles. When a Coast Guard official told him the search was being called off December 1, Zakary Ingraham responded, \"I don't feel like he's dead. I don't feel it.\" He was right. Twelve days after that first distress call, Ron Ingraham was picked up about 64 miles (103 kilometers) south of Honolulu \"weak, hungry and dehydrated\" and -- most importantly -- alive. The veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him. In February 2012, two friends asked 18-year-old Adrian Vasquez whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition. He said yes, and the three set off from the Panama town of San Carlos on a small boat, Vasquez's mother, Nilsa de la Cruz, recalled. Things started out well, by all accounts. The three caught plenty of fish. Then, their boat's engine died without warning. And, with no tools and scant navigational experience, the trio didn't know what to do, according to Vasquez's mother. Mother calls Panama teen's return 'a miracle' Vazquez ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat, the Fifty Cents, further and further from the coast and into the Pacific Ocean. Somewhere along the way, his two companions died. It's not clear exactly how, with Ecuadorian Rear. Adm. Freddy Garcia Calle saying Vasquez threw their bodies into the sea \"because they had become badly decomposed.\" Some 26 days after and nearly 600 miles away from where the journey began, fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the Galapagos Islands. The Ecuadorian navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor, who'd lost 20 pounds and showed \"severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition,\" according to Calle. He returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him, but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal. \"For us, this is an opportunity to get closer as a family,\" his mother said by phone, \"to be more understanding and loving.\" Sometimes one doesn't have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled. Sometimes people don't have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end. For proof, look no further than Hiromitsu Shinkawa. 60-year-old man waves red flag to alert rescuers. He was at home on March 11, 2011, when a massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck 231 miles northeast of Tokyo. A devastating tsunami followed, its 30-foot waves ravaging cities and towns and damaging several nuclear reactors. By the time it had run the course, nearly 16,000 people were dead. It's a miracle Shinkawa wasn't one of them. Shortly after the quake, he and his wife had gone to collect some belongings when the tsunami slammed their hometown of Minamisoma. His home was one of the tens of thousands destroyed by the the huge, powerful tsunami wave. \"I was saved by holding onto the roof,\" the 60-year-old said, according to Kyodo News Agency. \"But my wife was swept away.' More than two days later, video showed Shinkawa barely visible amid heaps of splintered wood, shattered homes and other debris floating more than nine miles (15 kilometers) out to sea. He was waving a self-made red flag. After being spotted by crew aboard a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer and picked up in a smaller rescue boat, he took a drink offered to him and burst into tears, Kyodo reported. Shinkawa told his rescuers, \"I thought today was the last day of my life.\"\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "This article tells the stories of three individuals who survived being stranded at sea for extended periods. Louis Jordan set off from South Carolina in January 2013 and was rescued 200 miles off the North Carolina coast after 11 days. Jose Salvador Alvarenga left from Mexico in late 2012 and was found on a remote atoll in the Marshall Islands 13 or 14 months later. Ron Ingraham, a 2012 fisherman from Hawaii, was rescued 12 days after his 25-foot sailboat capsized during bad weather. Adrian Vasquez, an 18-year-old from Panama, survived 26 days at sea after his boat's engine died and his companions passed away. Hiromitsu Shinkawa, a 2011 Japanese man, survived the tsunami caused by the Tohoku earthquake by holding onto his roof and was rescued more than two days later. These individuals relied on their resourcefulness, ingenuity, and luck to survive.",

She's one of three women arrested this week on terror charges. Two New York women were also taken into custody. An FBI complaint cites numerous social media messages dating back to August 2013 that were sent by Keonna Thomas, 30, also known as \"Young Lioness\" and \"Fatayat Al Khilafah.\" One Twitter message said, \"If we truly knew the realities ... we all would be rushing to join our brothers in the front lines pray ALLAH accept us as shuhada [martyrs].\" Another said, \"When you're a mujahid [violent jihadi fighter] your death becomes a wedding.\" The FBI said Thomas purchased an electronic visa to Turkey on March 23. Turkey is known as the easiest place from which to enter Syria and join ISIS. An ISIS manual advises recruits to buy round-trip tickets to vacation spots such as Spain and then purchase tickets for their real destination once they arrive overseas, the FBI said. On March 26, Thomas purchased a ticket to Barcelona, with a March 29 departure and an April 15 return to the United States, the complaint said. It's not clear when or where she was arrested. She was charged with knowingly attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. She could be sentenced to 15 years in prison. On Thursday, Noelle Velentzas, 28, and her former roommate, Asia Siddiqui, 31, were arrested in New York and accused of planning to build an explosive device for attacks in the United States, federal prosecutors said. In the past 18 months, the Justice Department's National Security Division has prosecuted or is prosecuting more than 30 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or provide support to terrorist groups. Of those cases, 18 allegedly involve support to ISIS. \"The terrorist threat is more decentralized, more diffuse, more complicated,\" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters Thursday. \"It involves the potential lone wolf actor, it involves the effective use of social media, the Internet.\"\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 97 words:\nPolice in the Indian city of Malegaon, in the western state of Maharashtra, are requiring identity cards for an unusual group of residents: Cattle. Following a recent state-wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef, authorities in the city have asked residents to take a 'mugshot' of their cattle and submit it to the police. Along with the photograph, the residents have to give information about their animal's 'unique features,' such as the coloring and age of the cow, along with the length of its tail and other distinctive characteristics. Police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law. Cows are considered holy and revered by that state's majority Hindu population. \"We are creating a database. If we get an information of a cow slaughter, we can quickly go to the resident's place and check whether it is there or not\", Mahesh Sawai, Deputy Superintendent of Malegaon Police told CNN. \"I believe this will be very effective\" So far over 100 owners have complied with the police order and more are lining up outside police stations across the city to get their livestock photographed. The ruling came in the wake of a recent case of cow slaughter in Malegaon, where two men have been charged for killing the animal and and selling its meat. The Maharashtra Animal Preservation Bill now includes bans on the killing of bulls and bullocks in its list of non-bailable offenses. Even the consumption or sale of beef could now land you in prison for five years. The slaughter of buffaloes, however, is still permissible. However, beef traders in the country strongly reacted to the decision and called a month-long strike, which ended Wednesday. The traders refused to even slaughter buffaloes and deprive the state of all bovine meat. They have now vowed to file a case in the state's high court. Red meat lovers weren't too delighted either, arguing the government doesn't have a right to interfere in an individual's personal preference. Maharashtra is not the only Indian state to tighten its laws on cow slaughter. Haryana state has implemented a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison, the toughest penalty in the country. Rajnath Singh, India's Home Minister has promised that he would do all to devise a country-wide law against cow slaughter.\n\noutput:",

Residents must submit photographs and details of their cow's unique features to create a database for enforcing the law. Over 100 owners have complied, while beef traders protested and ended a month-long strike. Maharashtra's Animal Preservation Bill includes bans on cow, bull, and bullock slaughter, with penalties up to five years. Haryana has the toughest penalty at 10 years, and Home Minister Rajnath Singh plans a country-wide law against cow slaughter.",

In the end, two agents were injured in a crash and the suspect was shot before being captured. FBI agents and task force officers were following 36-year-old Kevone Charleston of Austell, Georgia, as he pulled into a CVS pharmacy in Forsyth County, Georgia, early Saturday. Charleston is suspected of involvement in 32 commercial robberies dating to November 2013, according to FBI officials. \"The incident all happened around 7 o'clock Saturday morning,\" said FBI Special Agent Stephen Emmett. \"There were multiple agents and officers that were following him based on his prior MO, and when they saw he was about to rob another CVS, they moved in.\" Authorities say Charleston parked his vehicle nearby and then popped the hood as if there were something wrong. Then he walked to the CVS, preparing to enter. When agents confronted him, Charleston ran, got in his car and traveled about 75 yards as agents opened fire. \"There were several FBI vehicles that were rammed or were hit by the suspect's vehicle when he was trying to flee. One government vehicle sustained heavy damage to its front and side, and another government SUV ended up on its side. That's how the two agents sustained their injuries,\" Emmett said. Twelve FBI agents and six government vehicles followed Charleston. Emmett said Charleston \"was trying to get away, our agents were trying to stop him. He collided with the first government vehicle, the Taurus, then the second, and the SUV ended on its side. \"The perp was stopped 8 feet away in the median, and that's where he received his gunshot wounds.\" The two agents were treated at an area hospital and released, according to Emmett, who says \"they are fine.\" Charleston was shot and wounded by FBI agents and task force officers, but his injuries are not life threatening, according to Forsyth County Sheriff's Deputy Robin Regan. Although he declined to give details of the 32 previous robberies, Emmett said it was an intensive investigation that was already underway as a priority for the FBI's violent crimes and major offender squad. He added, \"His MO involved armed confrontations, so our officers went into this fully prepared for an armed confrontation based on his past history.\" Emmett says he's relieved that the FBI's officers and agents are OK and that the suspect is in custody. He said it was the \"conclusion of an intensive and lengthy investigation.\" CNN's Vivian Kuo and Ryan Scallan contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 161 words:\nBlue Bell ice cream has temporarily shut down one of its manufacturing plants over the discovery of listeria contamination in a serving of ice cream originating from that plant. Public health officials warned consumers Friday not to eat any Blue Bell-branded products made at the company's Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, plant. That includes 3-ounce servings of Blue Bell ice cream from this plant that went to institutions in containers marked with the letters O, P, Q, R, S or T behind the coding date. The warning by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not affect other Blue Bell ice cream, including other 3-ounce servings, not made at the plant. But Blue Bell has recalled other products. The company is shutting down the Broken Arrow facility \"out of an abundance of caution\" to search for a possible cause of contamination. It is the third time Blue Bell has taken action in light of a listeria outbreak at a Kansas hospital that served the company's ice cream. Listeria monocytogenes was recently found in a cup of ice cream recovered from the hospital. The cup contaminated with the bacteria was produced at the Broken Arrow plant in April 2014, Blue Bell said. And, according to the CDC, listeria bacteria was found in additional samples of the same product that were recovered from the plant. The bacteria in the hospital sample and the factory sample appeared to match each other genetically, the CDC said. But they did not appear identical to listeria samples taken from patients infected in the Kansas outbreak. In a separate outbreak in Texas, the CDC did find that listeria samples taken from patients who came down with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 in a hospital that served 3-ounce Blue Bell cups matched the listeria in recovered samples. None of this means the ice cream is the source of either spate of the infections. \"Investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing,\" the CDC said. In early March, in light of the Kansas listeria outbreak, Blue Bell recalled a group of products made at a plant in Texas. It later added 3-ounce cup servings to the recall. Five people were infected and three died in the past year in Kansas from listeria that might be linked to Blue Bell Creameries products, according to the CDC. All five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis, the CDC said. At least four of them had consumed milkshakes made with Blue Bell ice cream before developing the infection. \"We are devastated and know that Blue Bell has to be and can be better than this,\" Paul Kruse, Blue Bell CEO and president, said in a statement. \"Quality and safety have always been our top priorities. We are deeply saddened and concerned for all those who have been affected.\" The CDC advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away. In a statement on its website, Blue Bell said \"this recall in no way includes Blue Bell ice cream half gallons, pints, quarts, 3 gallons or other 3 oz. cups.\" This has been the first product recall in the 108-year history of Blue Bell Creameries, the company said. Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria, and primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC. Symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches, sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. In the United States, an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year, and approximately 16% of these illnesses result in death. Cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in stillbirth or spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters. CNN's Debra Goldschmidt, Amanda Watts and Jacque Wilson contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 173 words:\nWhen Hong Kong police answered a call in the early hours of a Saturday morning last November, they encountered a grisly scene and an alleged crime that shocked the city. One woman was lying on the floor with cuts to her neck and buttocks. Another was stuffed inside a suitcase on the balcony. A former banker, 29-year-old Briton Rurik Jutting, was charged with two counts of murder. On Thursday, a court hearing that was to determine whether there was enough evidence to proceed to trial was adjourned until May. Here's what we know so far about the victims and their alleged attacker. Jutting allegedly lived at the murder scene, an upmarket apartment in the middle of Wan Chai, an inner-city suburb that's home to an eclectic mix of late-night bars, residential tower blocks and local markets selling groceries and assorted cheap goods. In the early hours of Saturday morning, November 1, police say Jutting called them to the apartment.  There they found a woman lying on the blood-splattered floor, later identified as 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih. During a search of the apartment, officers uncovered another body hidden in a suitcase on the balcony. It's alleged 25-year-old Sumarti Ningsih was killed on October 27, five days before her body was found. Sumarti Ningsih was from Cilacap, in Central Java, and was the mother of a five-year-old girl. In a statement, her cousin, Jumiati, described her as  \"just an ordinary woman from Indonesia\" who, like many others, was \"forced to work abroad to feed her poor family and make her dream comes (sic) true.\" \"She wanted to work as professional so she can earn money and dignity for her family,\" Jumiati wrote. \"She is good girl and did not deserve this treatment.\" According to the Asian Migrant Coordinating Body, Ningsih was visiting Hong Kong as a tourist and had been due to fly back to Jakarta the day after her body was found. Last year, her grieving father, Ahmad Khaliman, told Agence France-Presse that his daughter had worked in Hong Kong as a domestic helper between 2011 and 2013. She'd since returned on two occasions, Khaliman said. He said the family had been shocked by her murder, and called for the perpetrator to be executed. \"If not, I cannot accept it. He has already taken my daughter's life, so he has to pay with his life,\" he told CNN affiliate Trans7. Seneng Mujiasih had more recently worked as a domestic worker in Hong Kong but had overstayed her visa, according to the Asian Migrant Co-ordinating Body. Also known as Jesse Lorena, Mujiasih was from the city of Muna in Sulawesi province, in southeast Indonesia. Other than that, few details are known about her life and why she stayed on in Hong Kong. After news of their death spread, fellow domestic workers held a vigil in Hong Kong's Victoria Park. Around 200 people gathered to sing and pray, and lay flowers besides photos of the two women. The victims' bodies were buried after being repatriated to Indonesia in November. Before being taken into custody, Rurik Jutting lived in the upmarket J Residence in Wan Chai.  He was detained at the scene, where police found the bodies of two women and seized a knife during a search of the premises. It's unclear when Jutting left his job as a trader at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch; a BoA spokesman would only confirm that a man of the same name had worked there in the past. Jutting's profile on LinkedIn said he haad been employed at the bank's structured equity finance and trading division in Hong Kong since July 2013. Before that, he worked in the same unit in London for three years. According to the profile, Jutting previously worked in capital markets for the British bank Barclays and studied history and law at the prestigious University of Cambridge, between 2004 and 2008. As part of the trial process, tests were conducted to determined if Jutting was psychologically fit to enter a plea. He was. The case was then adjourned to allow for more than 200 pieces of forensic and DNA evidence to be analyzed.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nAccording to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, \"(a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia.\" The Columbia team concluded that \"The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking.\" Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, \"We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students.\" Brian Stelter: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is:. Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that \"the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent.\" \"Actionable\" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers \"true.\" The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were \"of or concerning\" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is \"concerning\" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about \"a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue.\" If I said, \"The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals\" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the \"small group\" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are \"between jobs,\" these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won't be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.\n\noutput:",

The plant, located in Zhangzhou city, produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak, though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill. Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment, Xinhua news agency reported. More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control, the Zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account Tuesday morning. Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire. One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time. Though demonstrations are illegal in China, the construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years. The Zhangzhou plant was slated for Xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country. However, it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current, more remote location.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 161 words:\nWhen I was elected to the Kentucky State Senate in 1967, I became the first woman and the first person of color to serve in the body.  Five decades later, I find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation. But that is what Rand Paul, who today declared he's running for president of the United States, is doing. His campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about \"expanding the Republican Party\" -- a message of inclusion. But those of us listening today who he is hoping to include, heard nothing more than hype. I'm not buying it. Since coming to the U.S. Senate, Paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of Republican.  He's tried to brand himself as the GOP's minority outreach candidate.  The problem for Paul, and the GOP at large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. Yes, it's about time that Republicans started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle.  But they can't actually appeal to the community unless they have a real commitment to the issues facing minority communities.  A quick survey of Sen. Paul's positions makes clear that he does not. Paul kicked off his announcement speech in Louisville by declaring \"I have a message that is loud and clear:  We have come to take our country back.\"  I have no doubt that under Paul's leadership, he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the Civil Rights Act --  which Paul has done since landing on the national stage; when there was no Department of Education -- a department he thinks \"should be done away with;\" when women didn't have choices -- choices Paul seeks to limit in Washington; when DREAMers weren't protected from deportation -- protections Paul currently opposes. In his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities, he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency. But Paul has also questioned the Civil Rights Act, and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate. When asked about the need for a more robust Voting Rights Act following the Supreme Court's dismantling of the law, Paul dismissively remarked, \"We have an African-American President.\" When President Obama stood with John Lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, he inspired us all by saying: \"With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity. ... With effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote.\" America is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy, not less.  Unfortunately Rand Paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle.  Paul tried once again from that stage in Louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden Republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year. But his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated, outside of the mainstream, and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country. The American people deserve a leader who won't disrespect their intelligence, who won't pander to them when it's convenient, and who won't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades. What I heard today, didn't change the facts about Rand Paul's record.  The American people deserve better than Rand Paul.\n\noutput:",

He has questioned the Civil Rights Act, opposed protections for DREAMers, and dismissed the need for a stronger Voting Rights Act. Paul's attempts to appeal to minority communities have been criticized as condescending and lacking cultural competency. His record on education, women's rights, and civil rights contradicts his claims of expanding the Republican Party. The American people deserve a leader who respects their intelligence, doesn't pander, and supports progress, not regression. Rand Paul's record does not meet these standards.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nThis is the end. Beautiful friend, the end. For the 1960s, the end arrived with -- depending on your ideals and your tribe -- either the Rolling Stones' Altamont fiasco in December 1969, the Kent State shootings in May 1970 or Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election. For \"Mad Men,\" the \"end of an era,\" as its slogan has it, begins Sunday. Over the past eight years, the show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times has become part of the national fabric, if never a huge ratings hit. Stores have created fashion lines inspired by the show; there have been \"Mad Men\" cocktails and \"Mad Men\" museum exhibits and even \"Mad Men\" presidential references. Don Draper, the creative director played by Jon Hamm, has become a symbol of the times -- his and, sometimes, ours. Its subjects have taken the show to heart. In March, a \"Mad Men\" bench was unveiled in front of New York's Time & Life Building, where the fictional firm of Sterling Cooper & Partners has its headquarters. The end of a TV series brings with it some risk. \"The Sopranos,\" \"Mad Men\" creator Matthew Weiner's former employer, divided fans with its famous cut-to-black finale. On the other hand, \"Mad Men's\" former AMC stablemate, \"Breaking Bad,\" was saluted for an almost perfect landing. Speaking of landings: The last season -- technically, the first half of season 7 -- ended with the moon landing in July 1969. Though Weiner and his cast have been typically tight-lipped -- Weiner even hid the finale from his cast at first -- it's reasonable to assume the new season will pick up soon afterward. What's going to happen? Here are some educated guesses. With the '60s screaming towards their conclusion, \"Mad Men\" probably won't jump ahead much. The latter half of 1969 included the Manson murders, the Woodstock festival, a New York mayoral campaign and the Vietnam War moratorium demonstrations -- plenty of fodder for the characters to interact with, if only tangentially. Who knows? The show might even mention the Miracle Mets. It would be a nice way to acknowledge the agency's late Lane Pryce. Of course, Weiner might have a different idea; he's from Baltimore. \"Mad Men\" is generally a show about disintegration, reflective of the '60s themselves. The old orders are falling apart: white-shoe WASP firms like Sterling Cooper giving way to the ethnic pace-setters such as Doyle Dane Bernbach; grimy New York replaced by sunny Los Angeles; the \"Good War\" generation butting heads with the \"Make Love, Not War\" cohort; vacuum tubes and ledger books being displaced by a sleek, solid-state IBM world. It's all an ad agency can do to keep up. Last season saw plenty of intraoffice turmoil, thanks to the ill-fitting merger between Sterling Cooper and former rival Cutler Gleason and Chaough. Though the agency survived, it's now without Bert Cooper (Robert Morse) and under the ownership of (real-life) Madison Avenue titan McCann Erickson. That's not a recipe for long-term survival, and expect a number of longtime characters -- Ken Cosgrove (Aaron Staton), Harry Crane (Rich Sommer) and perhaps even Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks) -- to look for an exit. Roger Sterling -- the wisecracking executive played by John Slattery -- might find an exit as well, but not one he's anticipating. He's suffered two heart attacks. He drinks to excess. He's never grown up. Bet on a sudden and shocking departure. On the other hand, Peggy Olson's star has continued to rise (much like one of the character's models, advertising wunderkind Mary Wells Lawrence). She left Sterling Cooper once; indeed, she wouldn't have returned if her new agency hadn't merged with her old one. If Olson, played by Elisabeth Moss, bolts the firm, it will probably be to head her own agency -- and possibly get married. That is, if she's still interested in such an old-fashioned tradition. In recent seasons, Don's ex-wife, Betty (January Jones), has lost herself amid all the turmoil. She sees herself through the eyes of her spouses, and though husband Henry Francis (Christopher Stanley) has been far more supportive than Don, he's a busy man. And Sally, Don's daughter (Kiernan Shipka), is proving to be a handful. On the one hand, she's obviously bright; on the other, she's a teenager and starting to rebel. In recent seasons she's run away and started sneaking cigarettes, and she's always fighting with her mother. You could see her hitchhiking to Woodstock, or at least dropping out of school. Anything's possible, but given all that the character has been through -- divorces, affairs, office politics, morose late-night rides with Glen Bishop -- it's a bit on the nose, isn't it? Instead, try this: It's April 1, 1970. Richard Nixon is signing legislation banning cigarette ads on radio and television, reminding Don of the day 10 years earlier when he came up with the Lucky Strike campaign that began the series. No fool, he had seen this day coming years before. He'll fix himself a drink, ponder buying an avocado-colored refrigerator, clean out his ashtray and leave the show the way he arrived: on top of the zeitgeist, unable to accept his past and utterly, inscrutably alone.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 149 words:\nBeijing (CNN)China's state prosecutors on Friday formally charged the country's former security czar with accepting bribes, making him the highest-ranking Chinese Communist Party official ever to face corruption charges. Zhou Yongkang, 72, was also charged with abuse of power and leaking state secrets, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the highest prosecution authority in China, said. As a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee -- China's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people. He retired in 2012. At the height of his power, Zhou controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems as well as prosecution offices across China -- and wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of \"preserving social stability.\" Now, prosecutors have accused Zhou of \"taking advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepting huge amounts of money\" during his long political career. His alleged actions have caused heavy losses to public assets and greatly harmed national interests, they added. Zhou was notified of his legal rights during the investigation and his lawyer's views were heard, according to a statement by the prosecutors. His case will be tried in Tianjin, a city near the Chinese capital, Beijing. The president of China's supreme court recently told reporters there would be \"open\" trials for accused former leaders like Zhou. However, the charge of leaking state secrets may allow authorities to shield certain legal proceedings from public view in Zhou's case. Zhou has not been seen in public since he attended an anniversary event at his alma mater in October 2013. He was expelled from the Communist Party and arrested last December. State media have painted an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around Zhou before the crumbling of his power structure last summer. Zhou and his family members were said to have accumulated enormous wealth, in a blatant exchange between money and power. He was also found to have affairs with multiple women and allegedly traded power for sex, state-run Xinhua news agency reported last year. Analysts have viewed his shocking downfall as a watershed moment in the secretive world of Chinese politics, now ruled by President Xi Jinping. Xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign,  targeting both \"tigers\" and \"flies\" --  high-ranking, and low-level, officials. Zhou is by far the biggest tiger caught in Xi's dragnet to date. \"The important thing here is that Xi has proven he's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former Politburo Standing Committee members,\" longtime political analyst Willy Lam, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said last year, when the government revealed its formal investigation into Zhou. Many observers also note Zhou's patronage of Bo Xilai, a former Communist leader sentenced to life in prison for corruption in 2013. Bo's spectacular downfall the year before -- complete with tales of murder, bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention. State media have cited his subsequent conviction as a prime example of Xi's resolve to clean up the party. The former Chongqing Communist Party chief's supporters, however, have long called him a political victim --  the former high-flying politician was once considered Xi's main challenger for the top spot of Chinese leadership. Political watchers see similarities between the Bo and Zhou cases. \"The people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles,\" said Lam, who has predicted a suspended death sentence for Zhou.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 178 words:\nIn her 40 years living in Rochelle, Illinois, Cathy Olson had never seen a tornado that big. \"I saw the top of the funnel cloud, and it was absolutely massive,\" she said. She watched the hulking gray twister grind past her town Thursday, tearing up its fringes. Farther north, in the rural Illinois hamlet of Fairdale, one person died as a twister shredded homes and ripped trees bare of leaves and most limbs. Only the thickest branches remained standing. It was the only death reported so far in two days of tornado touchdowns. Rochelle was fortunate. But in nearby Kirkland, debris was so thick on the roads, responders searching for trapped residents could not yet assess the damage or injuries, fire officials said. On Thursday, a video surfaced on YouTube of a massive twister barreling across an open field, barely missing farmhouses and barns. Images of the funnel turned up elsewhere on social media. Multiple tornadoes ripped through the rural Midwest on Thursday. A  large and dangerous twister tore across fields in Iowa. And a twister touched down 70 miles outside of St. Louis. Eight tornadoes were reported Wednesday in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, the Storm Prediction Center said. But it appears residents have been fortunate enough to come away from the terrifying weather spectacle alive. Hail stones the size of tennis balls plummeted down on Ashton, Illinois. It could have been worse as severe tornado damage dotted a path not far from the dense populations of Chicago and Rockford -- the state's third largest city.  The tornado cut a 22-mile path through Ogle County, according to disaster management coordinator Tom Richter. North of Rochelle, a tornado took away a local favorite restaurant -- Grubsteakers.  \"It's kind of one of your little greasy spoon restaurants,\" said Eric Widick, who drove up in his truck to help out. \"We're a community. If one person is in need, we'll all be there for them.\" People were inside when the storm quashed Grubsteakers and turned over a semitruck parked outside. No one was killed or seriously injured,  Widick said. Although a patron who found shelter in a restroom was trapped inside for about half an hour. People had been eating at Grubsteakers for some 25 years and will miss it, Widick said. In Rochelle, the tornado flattened some of Olson's friends' homes. A safe distance away from it, at her mother's house, she had to think about her husband, Chet, who was reelected mayor of the town of about 10,000 people the day before. He'd have a job ahead of him. \"I have not been able to get a hold of him, Olson said, \"but I know he's in touch with the sheriff and is safe,\" she said. Sheriff Brian VanVickle told journalists late Thursday that the tornado had spared life and limb in Ogle County aside from some people whose injuries were easily treatable. The county lost 20 homes -- one of them was his own. Fifty to 100 houses had significant damage, he said. Only foundations remained of some homes, said storm chaser Dan Gottschalk. \"You can hear the hissing everywhere from where the structures used to be,\" he said. Lindsey Clark, a reporter from CNN affiliate WREX, said rescuers were pulling trapped people from a home in the Rochelle area. VanVickle was newly elected sheriff of Rochelle on Wednesday. On Thursday, the storm took his house and his sister-in-law's. \"I've got the clothes on my back,\" he said. But his family wasn't at home when it hit. \"My family was on the way to Louisville, dog was in the basement and she survived.\" It was the first tornado the sheriff had ever seen in his county. \"I've lived here all my life, am the fifth generation in the county.  My mom said this is the first time she's ever seen a tornado.\" He is thankful that the National Weather Service warned one could come. That saved lives, he believes. The service warned of a \"particularly dangerous situation.\" People across the Midwest should be on alert for severe weather. Tornado watches were set to run out early Friday. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Catherine Shoichet, Greg Botelho, Dave Alsup, Steve Almasy, Jack Maddox and Sean Morris contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\n\"A long, long, time ago...\" Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece \"American Pie.\"  It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8½ minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old.  All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as \"Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie.\" There is no real way to categorize McLean's \"American Pie\" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. \"The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?\" McLean recalled.  \"Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.\"  By cathartically writing \"American Pie,\" McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, \"Tapestry,\" in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the \"generation lost in space.\"   When his cultural anthem \"American Pie\" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A Changin\" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of \"American Pie\" as one would of Henry Longfellow's \"Evangeline\" or Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of \"American Pie,\" for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel \"On the Road.\" Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace. Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when \"American Pie\" topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing \"American Pie\" at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing \"and they were singing\" everybody spontaneously joins in with the \"Bye, Bye\" chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes \"American Pie\" so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When \"American Pie\" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like \"Danny Boy\" or \"Streets of Laredo\" or \"Shenandoah,\" it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, \"American Pie\" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret \"American Pie,\" it's fair to surmise that \"the king\" is Elvis Presley, \"Helter Skelter\" refers to the Charles Manson murders, the \"jester on the sidelines in a cast\" is Bob Dylan, and \"Jack Flash\" the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to \"American Pie.\" Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose \"American Pie\" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were \"Over the Rainbow\" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y \"Yip\" Harburg), \"White Christmas \"(by Irving Berlin), \"This Land is Your Land\" (by Woody Guthrie) and \"Respect\" (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, \"American Pie\" is one of the greatest songs ever written.  And Tuesday the original lyrics found a new home.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\n(The Hollywood Reporter)Richard Dysart, the Emmy-winning actor who portrayed the cranky senior partner Leland McKenzie in the slick, long-running NBC drama \"L.A. Law,\" has died. He was 86. Dysart, who also played Coach in the original 1972 Broadway production of Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning \"That Championship Season,\" died Sunday at home in Santa Monica after a long illness, his wife, artist Kathryn Jacobi, told The Hollywood Reporter. The acclaimed \"L.A. Law\" — created by Steven Bochco (who eventually handed off the series to David E. Kelley) and Terry Louise Fisher — aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994. For playing the founder of the firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, Dysart was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years, finally winning the trophy in 1992. \"I always had him in mind for that role,\" Bochco said in a 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television. \"He's so avuncular. So I reached out to him. You know, Dick is sort of an old hippie. So he went into his closet and tried to find a lawyer outfit, and he came to meet us wearing a suit and tie. He was perfect.\" \"We got together, mapped out the character's past to give us a basis from which to work, and it's all gone smoothly since then,\" Dysart said in a 1990 interview with The Seattle Times. \"Sometimes I worry — it's all been going too well — a role I love to play in a series that's about as good as you can get. Something's wrong!\" Perhaps Dysart's most memorable character arc on the show was when he was found in bed with power-hungry competitor Rosalind Shays (played by Diana Muldaur). He was one of the few actors to appear in every episode. Dysart's range of authority -figure parts ran right to the top. He limned Harry Truman in the CBS telefilm \"Day One\" and in the ABC miniseries \"War and Remembrance,\" both of which aired in 1989, and he was Henry L. Stimson, the 33rd U.S. president's Secretary of War, in the 1995 HBO telefilm \"Truman,\" starring Gary Sinise. Similarly, he played the Secretary of Defense in \"Meteor\" (1979). Hollywood Reporter: Most powerful people in N.Y. media. Dysart also performed extensively in the medical- (movie) field, performing enough doctor roles to, perhaps, qualify to practice. His two most memorable came in classic satires: in Paddy Chayevsky's scathing \"The Hospital\" (1971), starring George C. Scott (a good friend), and in \"Being There\" (1979), as Melvyn Douglas' doctor. He also was a doctor who died a gruesome death in John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" (1982) and a physician in such films as \"The Terminal Man\" (1974), \"The Falcon and the Snowman\" (1985) and \"Warning Sign\" (1985). Dysart portrayed J. Edgar Hoover in the 1993 USA telefilm \"Marilyn & Bobby: Her Final Affair\" and in Mario Van Peebles' \"Panther\" (1995). Dysart also excelled as cranky coots and shifty sorts. He portrayed a motel receptionist in Richard Lester's \"Petulia\" (1968); was the bad guy who battled Clint Eastwood in \"Pale Rider\" (1985); stood out as a power player in Oliver Stone's \"Wall Street\" (1987); and sold barbwire in \"Back to the Future III\" (1990). Dysart was born March 30, 1929, in Boston and raised in Maine. Following high school, he attended the Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine, for a year, served in the U.S. Air Force and attended Emerson College, where he graduated with a master's degree in speech communications. At the time, he was interested in a career in radio (he became fascinated with the medium in first grade, when he was bedridden for a year because of rheumatic fever) but was soon tempted by acting. He moved to New York on a whim and was able to land minor roles on TV and a part in an off-Broadway production of \"The Iceman Cometh\" opposite Jason Robards. In the mid-1960s, he joined the American Conservatory Theater and toured the country doing plays, then landed roles on Broadway in \"All in Good Time,\" \"The Little Foxes\" and \"A Place Without Doors.\" He received a Drama Desk Award for his performance in \"That Championship Season.\" Hollywood Reporter: Q&A with Liz Smith. Dysart's credits include an eclectic array of movies, including \"The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder\" (1974), \"The Day of the Locust\" (1975), \"The Hindenburg\" (1975), \"An Enemy of the People\" (1978), \"Prophecy\" (1979), \"Mask\" (1985) and \"Hard Rain\" (1998). On television, he was top-notch in the telefilms \"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman\" (1974), \"The People vs. Jean Harris\" (1981), as Dwight D. Eisenhower in \"The Last Days of Patton\" (1986) and as studio chief Louis B. Mayer in \"Malice in Wonderland\" (1985). Survivors also include his stepson Arie and daughter-in-law Jeannine Jacobi, mother-in-law Lenore, brother and sister-in-law Nadine and John Jacobi and grandchildren Abby and Levi. A private memorial is being planned. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, an outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area. Dysart and Jacobi had a second home in the forests of British Columbia. He was lured out of retirement for his last onscreen appearance, the \"L.A. Law\" reunion telefilm of 2002. \"They remain timely, with cases about points of law that are still current,\" he said of watching \"L.A. Law\" reruns in a 2002 interview with The Bangor Daily News. \"[The show] was also one of the fathers of yuppiedom. It was very much of the times, and very Los Angeles. It holds up as well as any series I know.\" People we've lost in 2015. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.\n\noutput:",

Letourneau gave birth to her young lover's child and went on to serve more than seven years in prison on charges related to their sexual relationship.

The pair wed soon after she was released from prison in 2005 and are now the parents of two teen girls. According to ABC, during the interview with Barbara Walters, \"Mary Kay tells Walters what makes their marriage work in spite of their huge difference in their age.\" \"She also discusses her surprising plans to teach again, as well as her intentions to have her status as a registered sex offender lifted,\" a posting on the network's site says. \"Vili Fualaau, meanwhile, discusses his bouts with alcoholism, depression and why he believes the system failed him while he was still a minor.\" Letourneau Fualaau is now 53, and her husband is 31.\n\noutput:",

The movie -- also starring Liv Tyler, Anthony LaPaglia and Renée Zellweger -- centers on an independent record store in Delaware where, on April 8, former pop idol Manning is scheduled to make an in-store appearance.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 92 words:\nThat's some rich \"American Pie.\" The lyrics to the famed Don McLean song sold for $1.2 million Tuesday morning at an auction held by Christie's. \"Don McLean's manuscript of 'American Pie' achieved the 3rd highest auction price for an American literary manuscript, a fitting tribute to one the foremost singer-songwriters of his generation,\" Christie's Tom Lecky said in a statement. McLean told Rolling Stone that it was time to part with the manuscript. \"I'm going to be 70 this year,\" the singer and songwriter said in February. \"I have two children and a wife, and none of them seem to have the mercantile instinct. I want to get the best deal that I can for them. It's time.\" Over the years, \"American Pie\" has become one of the most dissected and argued-about songs in the pop music canon. McLean has said that the opening lines were inspired by the death of Buddy Holly, but after that, it's all been conjecture -- which hasn't stopped a marching band's worth of analysts from trying to parse the symbols in the 8-minute, 33-second opus. Is the jester Bob Dylan? The football game Vietnam? The \"girl who sang the blues\" Janis Joplin? (One thing's certain: Buddy Holly's plane was NOT named \"American Pie.\") \"Over the years I've dealt with all these stupid questions of 'Who's that?' and 'Who's that?' \" McLean said. \"These are things I never had in my head for a second when I wrote the song. I was trying to capture something very ephemeral and I did, but it took a long time.\" The song catapulted the former folk singer to headliner status. The song hit No. 1 in early 1972, despite its length. (The 45-rpm single split the song in half on its A and B sides.) The draft that was auctioned is 16 pages: 237 lines of manuscript and 26 lines of typed text, according to Christie's. It includes lines that didn't make the final version as well as extensive notes -- all of which should be revealing, McLean said. The record for a popular music manuscript is held by Bob Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" which sold for $2 million in June. Opinion: What's so great about 'American Pie'?\n\noutput:",

The photographer, Daniel Ramos, had filed the civil suit against West  after the hip-hop star attacked him and tried to wrestle his camera from him in July 2013 at Los Angeles International Airport. West pleaded no contest last year to a misdemeanor count of battery over the scuffle. A judge sentenced him to two years' probation, as well as anger management sessions and community service. Ramos and his lawyer, Gloria Allred, sought general and punitive damages in the civil suit, saying that West had interfered with the photographer's rights to pursue a lawful occupation. The case had been set for trial next week, but Allred issued a statement Tuesday night saying Ramos' side had filed a dismissal \"because the case was settled to the satisfaction of the parties.\" She didn't disclose the details of the settlement other than saying that \"one important aspect of it was an apology by Kanye West to our client, Daniel Ramos.\" Her statement included a picture of West and Ramos shaking hands, which she said happened after the apology. The original incident was caught on video, including the following exchange. \"Kanye! Kanye! Talk to me, Kanye!\" Ramos shouts outside a terminal at the Los Angeles airport on the night of July 19, 2013. \"What's' going on? Why can't we talk to you?  I mean, why?\" he asks as West moves through a group of paparazzi. \"Now come on, Kanye, I don't want to fight with you,\" he says as West advances toward him. \"I told you, don't talk to me, right,\" West says. \"You're trying to get me in trouble so I step off and have to pay you like $250,000.\" West is then seen rushing the photographer and attempting to wrestle his camera from his hands. West retreats after about 15 seconds of scuffling with the photographer. \"We believe that this case sent an important message,\" Allred said. \"Celebrities are not above the law, and they have no right to physically attack someone simply because they were asked a question.\" Beverly Hills Police investigated an incident in January 2014 in which West was accused of assaulting a man at a Beverly Hills chiropractor's office. West avoided criminal charges by reaching a civil settlement with the man. Kanye West apologizes to Beck, Bruno Mars. CNN's Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

With two hooves sticking out for several minutes in the midst of labor? Luckily, Katie -- a giraffe at the Dallas Zoo -- is a champ. In an hour-long labor captured by 10 cameras and streamed live by Animal Planet, Katie gave birth to a not-so-little baby (about 6 feet tall) early Friday evening. There was no immediate word on the newborn's gender or condition. But there were good signs, as seen on the live stream and Dallas Zoo's Twitter feed -- like its ears moving, its efforts to stand, and its nursing (or at least trying to nurse) from mom. \"We're so proud,\" the zoo tweeted. The newcomer's debut was a long time coming, especially when you count for Katie's 15-month gestation period -- average for a giraffe, according to Animal Planet. The baby joins a sister, 4-year-old calf Jamie. It wasn't immediately known how many people online saw Katie go into labor and give birth. But the giraffe definitely did have watchers in the form of fellow giraffes who saw the scene unfold from an abutting barn, one of them being Katie's BFF Jade. The fact that the spunky Katie held up so well under the spotlight isn't a total shocker.  The zoo describes her as the \"diva\" among a herd of 12 giraffes at the zoo who loves to \"toss her head around\" when she doesn't like something. As Animal Planet noted, \"She's one of the only giraffes at the Dallas Zoo who can stick her long tongue out on cue.\" CNN's Justin Lear contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

The suspect's vehicle was spotted outside the Census Bureau, which is in Suitland, Maryland. A guard apparently approached the vehicle and saw two people arguing. That guard was then shot at least once in the upper body, said Prince George's County Fire Department spokesman Mark Brady. The guard was in extremely critical condition, according to Brady. The police chief said the suspect then fled the scene. Officers picked up the chase, and the suspect fired gunshots at multiple locations, Lanier said. The chase ended in a crash on Washington's busy H Street. A shootout ensues, Lanier said. An officer and the suspect were wounded, according to the police chief. Both were conscious and talking when they left the scene. \"Right now, we have every reason to believe that the car that we have in this last incident here is the same car involved and the same person involved in the kidnapping,\" she said.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 196 words:\nThe outlines of a nuclear deal with Iran are in place. Unfortunately, it seems like too many in President Barack Obama's administration have forgotten that the only reason this terrorist-supporting state came to the negotiating table in the first place was because of tough sanctions imposed by the U.S. Congress. Indeed, the reality is that President Obama is giving up enormous leverage in his nuclear deal with Iran -- and I worry we will lose it for good. Bleeding money, and faced with falling oil prices, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei gave his government rare permission to bargain with the \"Great Satan\" -- the United States. But just as U.S. and European sanctions were forcing Iran to the nuclear crossroads, President Obama has given Tehran an easy exit. For Khamenei, the \"framework\" announced last week looks like a win-win: He gets to keep his nuclear infrastructure, and in return gets billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Congress offered a better strategy when the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, and I introduced a bill to hit Tehran with its toughest sanctions yet. Unfortunately, this bill -- which passed the House in a 400-20 vote -- was blocked in the Senate last year, despite the fact that it would have sharpened the Ayatollah's choice: Dismantle your nuclear weapons program or see your economy collapse. President Obama once had a tougher line, when in 2012 he said: \"The deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program. It's very straightforward.\" But the framework announced last week does nothing of the sort. Negotiated between Iran and the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, the framework concedes that Iran can maintain \"a mutually defined enrichment program,\" operate thousands of centrifuges, and continue its research and development of nuclear technologies. The deal currently on the table would hand Tehran billions of previously sanctioned funds, filling the coffers of the world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism, with strongholds in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon. Meanwhile, the strictest restrictions on Iran's enrichment will expire in only 10 years, despite the President receiving a letter from 367 Members of Congress -- both Democrats and Republicans -- in which we insisted that \"verifiable constraints on Iran's nuclear program must last for decades.\" The President admitted as much when he conceded that \"in year 13, 14, 15, they have advanced centrifuges that enrich uranium fairly rapidly, and at that point the breakout times would have shrunk almost down to zero.\" But as bad as these concessions are, the most concerning aspect of the April 2 deal is that it lacks tough safeguards to stop Iran from cheating. The key question is this: Will the inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency be allowed to inspect these military sites without warning? Because if the IAEA cannot conduct \"anytime, anywhere\" inspections, Iran will be able to \"sneak out\" to a bomb. It has been done before. Remember, in 1994, when President Bill Clinton told us he had struck a deal with North Korea that would \"make the United States, the Korean Peninsula, and the world safer\"? President Clinton sounded a little too much like the current Secretary of State John Kerry, when he promised that the North Korea agreement \"does not rely on trust\" and that \"compliance will be certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\" Twelve years after these assurances, North Korea detonated its first nuclear bomb. Iran could easily do the same. The best predictor of its future behavior is its past behavior -- between 2004 and 2009, the Iranian government built a huge centrifuge facility named Fordo under a mountain deep in the Iranian desert. Luckily for the world, Western intelligence agencies discovered Tehran's deception. But we cannot rely on such luck in the future, particularly when Iran still hasn't come clean about its history of secret weapons development and is still dodging basic questions from the IAEA. Let's not forget the other things Iran has been doing while its diplomats have been bargaining with the U.S. and its partners. While Iran was showing its friendly new face to the world, it has simultaneously been helping Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad kill his own people, training and funding the terrorist group Hezbollah, which aims to annihilate Israel, and supporting the Houthis, who started a civil war and overthrew the government in Yemen -- one of America's more reliable counterterrorism partners in the region. If President Obama is going to hand over billions of dollars to a regime that behaves like this, run by a man who publicly declares: \"Death to America,\" it has to be a better deal. The framework we have before us keeps Iran's nuclear door well and truly open.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "The nuclear deal with Iran, which is currently in place, has raised concerns due to the concessions made by the Obama administration.

The deal lacks sufficient safeguards to prevent Iran from cheating and does not require \"anytime, anywhere\" inspections of military sites. Additionally, Iran's nuclear restrictions will expire in 10 years. Iran's past behavior, such as building a secret centrifuge facility in 2004, raises concerns about its future intentions. While negotiating the deal, Iran has continued to support terrorism and destabilize the Middle East through its involvement in Syria, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. Critics argue that handing over billions of dollars to such a regime is not a good deal.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nCharleston, South Carolina (CNN)Police officers Saturday accompanied the hearse carrying the body of Walter Scott to his South Carolina funeral service, where hundreds of mourners celebrated his life and death as a catalyst for change in America. A pair of officers on motorcycles were part of the large procession delivering the father of four -- who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer -- to a service open to the public. An overflow crowd gathered on a humid and occasionally rainy April afternoon at W.O.R.D. Ministries Christian Center in Summerville, which has a capacity of about 300 people. The flag-draped casket of the U.S. Coast Guard veteran was wheeled inside the church as Scott's relatives and friends followed. Some dabbed tears; others embraced. Hundreds, including local officials, assembled inside the packed sanctuary -- in corridors, under an awning at the entrance, wherever they could stand. Silence filled the vast space as Scott's daughter Samantha read a poem of love dedicated to her father. Anthony Scott said God had selected his brother as a candidate for change in America. \"The change will come,\" he said, bringing to the crowd to its feet. The head of the church, George Hamilton, spoke of how Scott had brought members of his family to the church, of the agony of not only losing a family member but having to watch it happen on video. The death of Scott, who was black, at the hands of a white police officer was \"motivated by racial prejudice,\" Hamilton said. It was \"an act of overt racism.\" \"Hate came because Walter was an African-American,\" he said. Hamilton said his remarks were not meant as an indictment of law enforcement, but he singled out the officer who killed Scott as a \"disgrace to the North Charleston Police Department.\" \"There is gong to be change,\" he said. \"Walter's death will not be in vain.\" After the service, pallbearers gently lifted Scott's casket into the hearse. Crowds poured from the church. A slow-moving procession of black cars then made its way to Live Oak Memorial Gardens in Charleston for the private burial. Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, said the death represented more than an race issue. \"It's a human issue,\" he said. \"We're getting emails from people in Arkansas telling us, 'I'm a white male, and I'm supporting this family.' Their son is going to be remembered for changing the way we look at each other.\" On Friday night, Scott's open casket was draped with an American flag, and he was in a dark suit for his private visitation in Charleston. A Dallas Cowboys banner -- his favorite NFL team -- was placed outside the casket, and a figurine of a Cowboys player stood at his side. But Scott's family was missing. They needed privacy, said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley, who attended. A week ago, Scott was killed in North Charleston after getting pulled over for a broken taillight. A passer-by caught the shooting on cell phone video, and Officer Michael Slager was swiftly charged with murder. He was fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted. Who was Walter Scott? The video shows Scott running from an officer, who fires eight shots. Scott is struck five times; he falls to the ground. \"Nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer's life or the life of another was threatened,\" National Urban League President Marc Morial said. \"The question here is whether the use of force was excessive.\" But one witness is speaking of a struggle before the shooting. And at least one expert believes a murder charge may not hold up. On Thursday, Gwen Nichols told CNN's Brian Todd that she saw Scott and Slager scuffling at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" Nichols said. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying 'Stop!' \" Nichols' account has similarities to Slager's. He had told investigators that he had tussled with Scott over his Taser and that he feared for his safety. A timeline of events. Criminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slager's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case. \"Defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- (that) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation, a physical altercation with a suspect,\" Callan said. \"And that would constitute manslaughter under law, as opposed to murder, and it makes a huge difference in sentencing.\" In South Carolina, a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation. But the account from the witness who recorded the cell phone video, Feidin Santana, paints a different picture. He was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott, he said, who was on the ground. Santana said he could hear the sound of a Taser in use. He said he didn't see Scott go after the Taser, as Slager initially claimed. He said he believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana said. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana started recording shortly after that. Investigators from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division found troubling inconsistencies from the very start, it said in a statement. \"We believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter,\" division Chief Mark Keel said in a statement. \"The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions.\" Slager's lawyer, Andy Savage, has complained that he \"has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has.\" Savage's office said in a statement that it has yet to receive \"any investigative documents, audio or video tapes, other than a copy of Mr. Slager's arrest warrant.\" The news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that Slager belongs to \"is no longer involved in the case.\" Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said Slager's wife, Jamie, who is eight months' pregnant, and his mother had a visit with him at the county detention center Friday.  Slager was being held in isolation and being \"monitored for his mental health,\" Cannon said. In a statement, one of Slager's lawyers said the meeting lasted about an hour. \"His wife and mom were tearful but strong, and they were all very grateful for the chance to see him in person, even if separated by a thick pane of glass,\" the statement said. \"They held up family photos -- and even Jamie's ultrasound from earlier that day -- to remind him of all those who love him. Throughout the visit, Michael was focused on Jamie and their baby and was very relieved to know that she is being shown so much love and support by their families.\" A second video, taken from a police dash cam, has also emerged from the day Scott died. It shows moments before  the shooting, when things seemed to be going smoothly between Scott and Slager. Scott apparently tells the officer that he has no insurance on the vehicle, and Slager returns to his car to do paperwork. Then Scott gets out of the car and runs out of the camera's frame. Scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop, according to court records. That was why he ran, lawyers for the family said after the funeral service. U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, told reporters outside the service that Scott lost a $35,000-a-year job the first time he was jailed for failing to pay child support. \"He said it was the best job he's ever had,\" Clyburn said. \"Now you have to ask ... if you want to collect child support, there's got to be income. And you ain't going to make much income from jail. It seems to me that we need to take a look to how to deal with that issue without causing unemployment and the loss of freedom.\" On Friday afternoon, police met with a man who was in Scott's car, but the passenger's name wasn't in a police report obtained by CNN. He was detained briefly after the shooting, one officer wrote in the report. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said he was a co-worker and friend. But he did not identify the passenger by name. On Friday, a few mourners trickled into the Fielding Home for Funerals. A white banner with a blue star near Scott's casket displayed his favorite NFL team. It said: \"Tradition, the Cowboys way.\" \"This is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community,\" said Riley, the mayor. \"It breaks everyone's hearts.\" CNN's Polo Sandoval and Martin Savidge reported from Charleston, and Ben Brumfield and Ray Sanchez reported and wrote in Atlanta and New York.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "On April 18, 183 words, in Charleston, South Carolina, Walter Scott's funeral was held at W.O.R.D. Ministries Christian Center, where hundreds mourned his life and celebrated him as a catalyst for change in America. Police accompanied the hearse carrying Scott's body, who was fatally shot by a North Charleston police officer, Michael Slager. The service was open to the public and held in a packed sanctuary, with an overflow crowd gathering outside. Scott's family and friends, including his brother Anthony, spoke of his love and impact on their lives. The head of the church, George Hamilton, addressed the racial prejudice behind Scott's death, calling it an \"act of overt racism.\" After the service, pallbearers carried Scott's casket to the hearse, and the procession made its way to Live Oak Memorial Gardens in Charleston for a private burial. Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, emphasized that the issue was not just about race but about humanity. The previous night, Scott's open casket was visited by family and friends, with a Dallas Cowboys banner and figurine present. Scott was killed a week ago after being pulled over for a broken taillight, and Officer Slager was swiftly charged with murder based on a cell phone video showing the shooting.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nAn Amnesty International report is calling for authorities to address the number of attacks on women's rights activists in Afghanistan. The report, entitled \"Their Lives on the Line,\" examines the persecution of activists and other champions of women's rights not only by the Taliban and tribal warlords, but also by government officials. Its publication is timely. The brutal murder of Farkhunda, a young woman in Afghanistan, whose body was burnt and callously chucked into a river in Kabul, shocked the world. Accused of burning pages from the Muslim holy book, the Quran, many protested the 27-year-old's innocence. But what also made international headlines was the fact that for the first time in history, women in Afghanistan became pallbearers, hoisting the victim's coffin on their shoulders draped with headscarves, under the gazes of men; unreservedly sobbing and shouting messages of women's solidarity as they marched along the streets. In a country ranked in 2011 by a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll as the most dangerous place in the world for women, this feminist act seemed perilous. Latest figures suggest they were risking their lives to be heard. In 2013, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) released statistics that showed the number of women killed in the country had increased by 20% from the previous year, although the number of civilian victims had decreased, said Amnesty in the report. The Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General in Afghanistan at the time, Jan Kubis, told the U.N. Security Council that \"the majority (of women killed) is linked to domestic violence, tradition, culture of the country. \"Women activists have been deliberately targeted.\" And according to the human rights group, little support has come from those in power. \"The Afghan government has done very little to protect them,\" Amnesty's Afghanistan researcher, Horia Mosadiq, tells CNN. \"Perpetrators almost always walk free, and threats reported by women rights defenders are often simply ignored. \"Many women defenders we spoke to said that even when they received some protection from authorities, it was often significantly less than what male counterparts or colleagues were afforded.\" During the attack on Farkhunda, \"many eyewitnesses have testified that police officers stood idly by while this woman was being lynched and killed,\" says Mosadiq. Twenty-six people were arrested and thirteen police officials suspended in connection with the attack, but she argues that this is insufficient. \"Suspending police officers is not enough, those who failed in their duty must also be held to account -- anything less will just encourage further mob violence.\" But what is striking is the resilience of the activists, who continue their work despite their lives being on the line. \"It was a remarkable moment,\" says Mosadiq, recalling the female protesters at Farkhunda's funeral. \"Unlike anything I have seen in my decades of campaigning for women's rights in our country.\" Selay Ghaffer, 32, is a women's rights activist and spokesperson for the Solidarity Party of Afghanistan -- a small but outspoken political party based in Kabul and twenty provinces that fights for issues such as democracy, social justice and women's rights. The party was the first to be banned in the country for accusing Afghan leaders and commanders of war crimes and demanding that they be brought to justice. Taking part in Farkhunda's funeral and protests against her death, she tells CNN that despite the onslaught of violence against Afghan women over the years, this was the worst case. But the opportunity was taken to deliver a clear message. \"So the women of Afghanistan showed that we will not keep silent anymore... And we are not ready to accept more brutality and violence against women,\" said Ghaffer. \"So this is why we decided to carry the dead body of Farkhunda on our own shoulders and show to the world that not only men can do it and somehow broke the traditionalism that (a) man has to do this job.\" Surprisingly, she says that male onlookers supported their mission, although they are in the minority overall in the country. \"Men (at the funeral), they said you have to do this, because this is how you can change the hatred in Afghanistan. \"Without men, it is not possible for women to get their rights,\" she says. \"So these men and women were working together. But at the same time, women need to step forward for their rights.\" Mosadiq says the fight for women's rights was established a while ago. \"Women's activism in Afghanistan is nothing new -- the women's rights movement has grown substantially since 2001, and has fought for and achieved some very significant gains. \"These gains are under threat now, however, and some are even rolled back. It's essential that the government and its international partners do not allow this to happen.\" Ghaffer herself has been subject to threats because of her work, received through emails and phone calls, at her home and office. But she says she knew what she was getting herself into. \"I knew it wasn't an easy task. There might be many challenges and you have to lose your life when you are going and struggling for your rights. \"As a woman, I want to struggle more (for my rights), I want to have more people around me, to struggle with me.\" Mosadiq says it is too soon to talk about a revolution, although the response to Farkhunda's killing, from both men and women, has been a \"silver lining.\" Ghaffer, however, believes this is the beginning of an uprising -- but she says it needs to keep moving. Interestingly, it was a man in her life that motivated her to fight. \"I must say strongly that it was my father (who inspired me), who is not any more with me, because he... died three months ago,\" she says. \"He always told me that women always suffered in this country,\" she says, her voice overcome with emotion. \"And you have to struggle for your rights. Because in this traditional, patriarchal society, nobody will give these rights (to) you.\" She realizes how lucky she is, she adds, in a society where she has witnessed men -- fathers and husbands -- oppressing women as opposed to being their role models. Ghaffer maintains that silence is an injustice to women, not least to the victim of the recent, horrific mob violence. \"So if I should not do it, if another sister is not doing it, then who will do it? Who will get the rights for us? We have to struggle for it. \"If we keep our silence, more Farkhundas will be killed in this country.\"\n\noutput:",

In 2001, women's activism in Afghanistan began to grow, achieving significant gains, but these are now under threat. The Afghan government and its international partners are urged to prevent the rollback of women's rights. Ghaffer believes the response to Farkhunda's killing marks the beginning of an uprising for women's rights",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nChris Copeland of the Indiana Pacers was stabbed after leaving a trendy New York nightclub early Wednesday, and two Atlanta Hawks -- who had just finished a home game hours before the incident -- were among those arrested, according to police and CNN affiliates. The Hawks were not involved in the stabbing incident, police said, but were arrested on obstruction and other charges later. Though New York Police Department Det. Kelly Ort initially told CNN the incident occurred just before 4 a.m. at 1OAK, a club in New York's Chelsea neighborhood known to draw celebrities among its clientele, the club later told CNN that the stabbing occurred in front of the Fulton Houses project down the street. \"1OAK staff was unaware of the incident when it happened, as it occurred beyond their view in a different location. However, 1OAK's team assisted Mr. Copeland to their fullest capabilities, and called for help as soon as he was seen walking back towards the venue,\" the statement said. The statement continued, \"A review of the video footage seems to reveal the incident did not originate from the venue or its immediate surroundings that are under 1OAK supervision.\" Copeland and a female companion, Katrine Saltara, were in the club for about 10 minutes before leaving and walking down the street toward Fulton Houses, where their car was parked, said a 1OAK spokesperson. The spokesperson gave CNN additional details on condition of anonymity because 1OAK's legal team had approved only the club's official statement. The suspect, who the spokesperson said never entered 1OAK, stabbed Copeland and Saltara in front of Fulton Houses, and according to the club's statement, \"Mr. Copeland's driver sprang to accost and detain the apparent perpetrator and that individual is now in police custody.\" Charges against the suspect are pending, and his name will be released once charges are filed, Ort said. Copeland and Saltara tried to make their way back to the club to seek help from the 20 or so security personnel on hand, leaving a \"bloody trail of handprints\" between the site of the stabbing and the club, the spokesperson said. Copeland \"almost landed right next to the club,\" the spokesperson said, adding that surveillance footage will not show the actual stabbing because it occurred too far away from the club. The club shut down immediately after the incident, the spokesperson said. A male and two females were taken to area hospitals, Ort said. A knife was recovered, a suspect was arrested and two individuals not involved in the dispute -- the Hawks' Pero Antic, 32, and Thabo Sefolosha, 30 -- were arrested on charges of obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct, she said. Sefolosha faces an additional charge of resisting arrest, Ort said. Word of the stabbing quickly spread through the club, reaching Antic and Sefolosha, who went outside to check on their friend, Copeland, the 1OAK spokesperson said. At one point, the two began pushing their way through a crowd that had gathered around the scene, leading to their arrests, the spokesperson said. \"We will contest these charges and look forward to communicating the facts of the situation at the appropriate time,\" the players said in a joint statement released by the team. \"We apologize to our respective families, teammates, and the Hawks' organization for any negative attention this incident has brought upon them.\" The Hawks are in New York for a Wednesday night game against the Brooklyn Nets. Neither player will be in uniform, the team said. Police released little information Wednesday, but local media identified the injured man as Copeland, 31, who is from Orange, New Jersey. The Pacers released a statement saying Copeland suffered a knife wound to his left elbow and abdomen, and he's in stable condition at a New York hospital. \"We are aware that Chris Copeland was injured early this morning in New York City. We are still gathering information and will update when we know more. Our thoughts are with Chris and those injured,\" Larry Bird, the Pacers' president of basketball operations, said in a statement. Copeland's agent, John Spencer, issued a statement saying, \"We're concerned about the safety of Chris and Katrine. We don't have any details at this particular time. All we can do is pray and wait.\" The NBA and the Hawks front office said they were looking into the incident. \"We are aware of the situation involving Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha this morning. We are in the process of gathering more information and will have further comment at the appropriate time,\" Hawks spokesman Garin Narain said in an email. Copeland's Pacers are slated to play the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. The pair apparently had only recently arrived in New York prior to their arrests, as both were on the court for the Hawks' 96-69 win over the Phoenix Suns in Atlanta on Tuesday night. Antic played 12 minutes, and Sefolosha played 20. The game ended around 10 p.m. Copeland, a former Knick, was near the nightclub with Saltara when a 22-year-old Brooklyn man approached them, police told CNN affiliate WABC. There was some sort of dispute before the suspect stabbed the 6-foot-8-inch Copeland in the abdomen, slashed Saltara and then slashed another woman, the station reported. Saltara suffered cuts to her arm, breast and buttock, and the other woman suffered a slash to her stomach, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. While WCBS reported that the second woman was 53 years old, WABC reported she was 23. Images published in the New York Daily News showed a considerable amount of blood on the sidewalk and a white sports coupe, roped off with police tape, with several streaks of blood on its driver's side. Antic and Sefolosha interfered with officers trying to establish a crime scene, and one of the Hawks pushed a police officer, WABC reported. The Hawks are preparing for a historic playoff run after clinching the No. 1 seed in the NBA's Eastern Conference. Tuesday's win over the Suns marked a franchise-best 58 wins in a season for the club. The Pacers sit in the conference's 10th spot but are only one game out of playoff contention. CNN's Laura Ly, Jason Durand and Jill Martin contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nIt took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that former NFL star Aaron Hernandez killed semi-pro player Odin Lloyd. On Monday, Hernandez's defense gave its side of the story, wrapping up its witnesses in less than a day. Hernandez, 25, is on trial for the shooting death of Lloyd, whose body was found in a Massachusetts industrial park in June 2013. Now that the defense has rested, it won't be long before the jury begins deliberating. Much of the evidence in the former New England Patriots' case is circumstantial. Here are some key points jurors will have to consider after each side makes closing arguments on Tuesday:. As news spread that Hernandez was under investigation in June 2013, Patriots owner Robert Kraft called in the tight end for a meeting two days after Lloyd's death. \"He said he was not involved,\" Kraft testified last week. \"He said he was innocent, and that he hoped that the time of the murder incident came out because he said he was in a club.\" There's only one potential problem with that claim: The time Lloyd was killed hadn't been made public yet by the time Hernandez met with Kraft. So how could Hernandez have known when Lloyd was killed? \"What a great, great witness for the prosecution,\" CNN legal analyst Mel Robbins said. \"Basically what happened is Aaron Hernandez lied to his boss. And the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand.\" When questioned by a defense attorney, Kraft said that he'd never had any problems with Hernandez and that the player was always respectful to him. Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, revealed for the first time last week that Hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couple's home that she said reeked of marijuana. She also said she didn't know what was in the box. That revelation may contradict the prosecution's contention that the weapon used in the killing was in the box. The murder weapon in the case has not been recovered. During cross-examination by the defense, Jenkins testified that she suspected marijuana because the box smelled \"skunky.\" Earlier, she told prosecutors during direct examination that she didn't know what was in the box. She said Hernandez never told her, and she never looked. After concealing the box with her daughter's clothing, Jenkins said she threw it away in \"a random dumpster\" but could not remember exactly where. Much testimony has focused on the shoes Hernandez wore the night Lloyd was shot. A Nike consultant testified that Hernandez was wearing Nike Air Jordan Retro 11 Lows. About 93,000 pairs of that shoe were made, significantly fewer in a size 13. The shoe's sole makes a distinct impression, said Lt. Steven Bennett of the Massachusetts State Police. The consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney Jamie Sultan that other Nike shoes -- more than 3 million -- make the same impression. Yet Bennett, who works in crime scene services, testified that the footprint left near Lloyd's body was \"in agreement\" or consistent with the Air Jordan Retro 11 Lows size 13. Although he did not have the shoes that Hernandez wore that night, he used an identical pair to make his determination. Bennett did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression. Jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression. What may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney Jamie Sultan. Sultan questioned the science behind analyzing footprints. He introduced a March 2014 investigative report written by Bennett saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to be able to make a comparison. Prosecutors used grainy footage from Hernandez's home security system to suggest he was holding a .45-caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill Lloyd. Hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after Lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from Hernandez's home. \"In my opinion, the firearm shown in the video stills is a Glock pistol,\" Glock sales manager Kyle Aspinwall testified. The video is time-stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say Lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car Hernandez was driving. Hernandez's lawyers then showed a different part of the video time-stamped a few seconds earlier with Hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand, suggesting it may be an iPad. \"Glock pistols don't have white glows to them, do they?\" defense attorney James Sultan asked. \"No, they do not,\" Aspinwall answered. Sultan then displayed a soft-pellet gun similar in shape to a Glock, suggesting it could also be the object Hernandez is holding. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in Lloyd's death. But already, his arrest has led to deep consequences, including his release from the New England Patriots and the loss of millions of dollars in expected earnings. So what might make a young man who had signed a $40 million contract risk everything? Prosecutors have said Lloyd might have done or said something that didn't sit well with Hernandez. They claimed Hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated a hit to settle the score. Hernandez's co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. But the case gets more complicated. Evidence collected in Lloyd's death investigation led to two more murder charges against Hernandez in a separate case in Boston. Hernandez is also accused of shooting Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub. That double shooting took place in July 2012, almost a year before Lloyd was killed. Prosecutors have said in pretrial hearings that Hernandez may have been mad at himself for possibly showing Lloyd the spot where that double murder happened. During trial, prosecutors suggest a text written by Hernandez the day before the murder saying he was \"buggin\" for showing Lloyd \"the spot\" may have played a role in plotting to kill Lloyd. The judge has banned any mention of the double murder in Lloyd's trial, ruling it is prejudicial. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in those deaths as well. But when the Lloyd trial ends, that murder trial awaits him. CNN's Jason Hanna, Lawrence Crook, Laura Dolan and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 174 words:\nA Delaware father is in stable condition and improving as his two boys remain in critical condition after they became sick -- perhaps from pesticide exposure, federal officials say -- during a trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family has confidence in their medical professionals and is hopeful for a full recovery, according to a statement released Monday from the family's attorney, James Maron. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital and released, and is in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family was renting. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results \"do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying.\" Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. For example, the pesticide is injected into the soil of some U.S. strawberry fields, said Judith Enck, an EPA regional administrator. \"We trust that the strawberry producers are making sure that there's not excess pesticide residue on strawberries,\" Enck said. \"You definitely want to wash them really good. \"This is a pesticide that's been around for a long time, and ironically because of its impact and damage to the ozone layer, it's being phased out because of the air impacts of this fumigant,\" Enck added. Field workers at a Connecticut nursery were poisoned by the chemical in 1990, according to the Journal of Industrial Medicine. In 2011, warehouse workers in California fell ill after exposed to grapes imported from Chile fumigated with methyl bromide, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said many parts of the world banned the chemical, a neurotoxin. The agent is to be used only outdoors. The chemical is also odorless and colorless, Gupta said. \"It's not something that you would have any warning of,\" Gupta said. The chemical is often mixed with tear gas so people can be aware of its presence, he added. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Enck, the EPA regional administrator, said paramedics were called early on March 20. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that the family's unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. On Monday, it ended its contract with Terminix. In an email to CNN before the termination, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation. \"Many questions remain why an odorless pesticide of this level of toxicity could be manufactured, distributed and applied in a residential area resulting in this family's injuries,\" Maron said. The attorney added: \"The family is confident that the responsible parties will be brought to justice and held accountable.\" CNN's Rob Frehse, Jean Casarez, Sara Ganim, Jason Hanna, Laura Ly and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 123 words:\nSaturday at the Masters, like any PGA tournament, has been dubbed 'Moving Day'. It's the day after the fat has been cut and the big dogs make their move up -- or occasionally down -- the leader board. Players rose and players fell away on Moving Day at the 2015 Masters. Rory McIlroy went out in 32 and briefly raised the crowd's hopes that he had a sniff of completing an improbable Grand Slam on Sunday night. But he dropped two shots late on in the round to finish six under par. Woods comeback? A rejuvenated Tiger Woods showed touches of his old class mixed with the ragged unpredictability that has marked his new game to finish six under too. A huge improvement, but still a long way from him wearing the green jacket again. \"It could have been a super low today,\" a disappointed Woods said after his round. \"All in all. It should have been two shots better.\" Phil Mickelson powered around the course, threatening to challenge too, finishing on eleven under. As did a late Justin Rose surge, where he fired four birdies in a row to finish twelve under and in second place. In the end, there was lots of moving, but no one could move quick enough or far enough to trouble Jordan Spieth. Infallible. The 21 year old has been nothing short of a sensation at Augusta. His infallible first two rounds gave the 21 year old from Dallas, Texas a five shot lead going in to the third round. That has happened only three times at Augusta before, and on all three occasions the leader has gone on to win. Spieth's 15 birdies are just 10 away from Phil Mickelson's Masters mark set in 2001. He could also break Tiger Woods 270 set in 1997. As it happened, Spieth played a steady, almost conservative round. When he made the occasional mistake, like the bogey at 15, he hit back straight away with a birdie next hole. As his third round came to a close the birdies flowed, his putting impeccable. The only nerves on show came during the last two holes with a double bogey at the 17. Echos of 1996? When reminded of some of the great Augusta comebacks, including Nick Faldo's 11 shot swing in 1996, Tiger Woods still believes anything is possible. \"It really is,\" he said. \"We saw what happened in 1996. You never know. It depends on the conditions.\" He is, of course, right. As Greg Norman knows only too well, anything can happen on the final day. But that kind of crescendo also depends on Spieth experiencing a Greg Norman-style meltdown. Spieth's double bogey on the 17th and wobble on the 18th will give the chasing pack some hope. Yet, for all the movement of Mickelson, Woods, Rose and McIlroy, they made just a one shot dent into Spieth's second round lead. He will begin Sunday four shots ahead.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "On the 123rd day of the 123rd Masters Tournament, also known as \"Moving Day,\" Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods made strides up the leaderboard, finishing six under par. Phil Mickelson and Justin Rose also impressed with rounds of eleven and twelve under, respectively. However, Jordan Spieth maintained his five-shot lead, having set the infallible pace with 15 birdies through two rounds. Spieth's third round was steady, with a double bogey at 17 the only blemish. Tiger Woods expressed optimism about potential comebacks, but Spieth will begin the final round four shots ahead.",

Billboard reports that the singer's family is creating a version of the singer that will be \"walking, talking, singing and dancing digital embodiment\" of her persona. \"By no means is this something that's creepy or weird,\" her sister, Suzette Quintanilla, told Billboard. \"We think it's something amazing. A lot of the new fans that did not get to experience what Selena was about hopefully will be able to get a sense of her with this new technology that's going to be coming out.\" Selena: 20 years after her death. The technology is being handled by Acrovirt LLC, a Nevada-based tech company. \"Using detailed individual personalized functions spanning the mind, brain and body, the individual's Digitized Human Essence will autonomously learn and react on behalf of its human counterpart's,\" the company explained. The project is being called \"Selena the One.\" Twenty years after she was killed by her fan club president, Selena remains incredibly popular, with her Facebook page recording 2 million likes and fans continuing to post videos and tributes. Selena will be the first figure to use the Acrovirt technology, Quintanilla said. \"I'm excited at the fact that she will be the first ever, and the fact that she's a Latina makes it even more awesome,\" she said. \"It's not about replacing Selena in any shape, way or form; it's just something to help her legacy continue growing.\" The family intends to expand her legacy in another way: with some new music. Selena the One \"will release new songs and videos, will collaborate with current hit artists, and aims to go on tour in 2018,\" said a statement on Selena's Facebook page. Selena isn't the first performer to try the virtual route. A Michael Jackson hologram appeared at the Billboard Music Awards in 2014, and a hologram of Tupac Shakur performed at Coachella in 2012. But the new technology is a step forward, Quintanilla said. \"People don't realize how fast technology is moving,\" she told Billboard. \"This is something that we're building for another two to three years, so when 2018 comes around they'll be like, 'Oh, OK, we get it.' \" Fans can join an Indiegogo campaign, www.selenatheone.com, to support the launch. The campaign, which hopes to raise $500,000, begins April 16. The commemorative Fiesta de la Flor in Corpus Christi, Texas -- which celebrates her life -- is scheduled for April 17 and 18.

Getting caught napping on the job in the cargo hold of a plane takes it to a whole different level. Alaska Airlines Flight 448 was just barely on its way to Los Angeles from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday afternoon when the pilot reported hearing unusual banging from the cargo hold. \"There could be a person in there so we're going to come back around,\" he told air traffic control. The banging in the cargo hold did come from a person and he turned out to be a ramp agent from Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage, the airline said.  The man told authorities he had fallen asleep. It appears he was never in any danger. The cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled, the airline said. The plane was also only in the air for 14 minutes. The passengers knew something wasn't right, almost as soon as the plane took off. \"All of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear,\" Robert Higgins told CNN affiliate KABC. The pounding grew louder. \"At that point, we started hearing yelling, screams for help, very, very faint,\" Jamie Davis said.  \"That's when we notified the flight attendant that there was somebody underneath us.\" As the banging continued, a federal air marshal sprang into action. \"At some point, the marshal kind of made himself known,\" said Troi Ge.  \"He started banging back, and he yelled really loud and said, 'We're getting ready to land, hold on to something.'\" The emergency landing spooked the folks aboard Flight 448. Affiliate KOMO spoke to Marty Collins, another one of the passengers. \"We just took off for L.A. regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we'd land within five to seven minutes, and we did,\" Collins said. \"When we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane.\" \"I think it's scary and really unsafe, too,\" Chelsie Nieto told affiliate KCPQ. \"Because what if it's someone who could have been a terrorist?\" The ramp agent appeared to be in OK after the ordeal. He was taken to an area hospital as a precaution, the airline said. He passed a drug test and was discharged. The employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m., just before the flight departed. \"During a pre-departure huddle, the team lead noticed the employee was missing. The team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee's cell phone, but did not receive an answer. His co-workers believed he finished his shift and went home,\" the airline's blog said. Alaska Airlines said it's investigating.  The man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight. All ramp employees have security badges, and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired, according to the airline. After the delay, the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to Los Angeles early Monday evening. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 136 words:\nOne year after it was perpetrated, the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls by a jihadist group in Nigeria remains a crime almost too horrifying to comprehend: Hundreds of teenaged girls, just finishing school, destined perhaps for significant achievement -- kidnapped, never to be seen again. \"This crime has rightly caused outrage both in Nigeria and across the world,\" the country's President-elect, Muhammadu Buhari, said Tuesday in marking the anniversary. \"Today is a time to reflect on the pain and suffering of the victims, their friends and families. Our thoughts and prayers, and that of the whole Nigerian nation, are with you today.\" The girls were abducted on the night of April 14-15, 2014, in the town of Chibok, in northeastern Nigeria, about a two-hour drive from the border with Cameroon. The Government Girls Secondary School had been closed for a month because of the danger posed by Boko Haram militants, who are opposed to Western education, particularly for girls. But students from several schools had been called in to take a final exam in physics. The militants stormed the school, arriving in a convoy of trucks and buses and engaging in a gun battle with school security guards. Then they forced the girls from their dormitories, loaded them into trucks and drove them into the forest. Most have never been seen since, except in a photograph in which they sat on the ground in a semi-circle, clad in Islamic dress. They were between 16 and 18 years old. Police said the militants kidnapped 276 girls in all. About 50 managed to escape soon after they were abducted. Those who did not, it is feared, may have been raped, brutalized, enslaved and forced to convert to Islam. Their parents were stricken with grief. The world was appalled. On Twitter, a hashtag began trending and spread around the world: #BringBackOurGirls. On Tuesday, Malala Yousafzai, the 17-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot in the face for speaking out in favor of girls' education, sent a message to the kidnapped girls. \"I am one of the millions of people around the world who keep you and your families foremost in our thoughts and prayers,\" she wrote. \"We cannot imagine the full extent of the horrors you have endured. But please know this: We will never forget you.\" One year later, a few things have changed. Each of the missing girls has had a birthday in captivity. Each is now a year older. Nigeria's current president, Goodluck Jonathan, was defeated in his campaign for re-election, in part, it is thought, because he failed to effectively combat Boko Haram. Buhari, the incoming president, has pledged an aggressive effort to wipe out the group. But much remains unchanged, as well. Boko Haram still controls swathes of northeastern Nigeria. According to UNICEF, 800,000 children have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict between the Nigerian military, civilian self-defense groups, and Boko Haram. Amnesty International says women and children continue to be abducted. And it says Boko Haram continues to kill in large numbers. Beyond that, more than 200 schoolgirls who had gathered one year ago to take their science exam are still missing.  Their families are still bereft. And Tuesday on Twitter, a hashtag was still trending: #BringBackOurGirls.\n\noutput:",

When police tracked down the mother, she told them her son was with her, Walker said. \"She indicated to both family members and the police officers that the child was with her down with her boyfriend in Maryland,\" he said. The boyfriend was not aware of what happened, Walker told CNN affiliate KYW-TV. Walker told reporters she bore \"clear criminal liability in this case.\" There was no reason for the man to suffer, Walker told philly.com, because the mother had sisters willing to take care of him. Two of his aunts, who have tried to obtain guardianship of him, were staying with him at the hospital, police told the website. Parler's sister told police that Parler has another child, a 16-year-old. The mother's arrest was only the beginning of the investigation, Walker told reporters. Authorities are interested in learning more about \"how this kid was cared for, and what actions were taken and providing of services by different agencies.\" CNN's Chuck Johnston and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "A Maryland woman, Nyia Parler, 41, faces attempted murder charges in Philadelphia for leaving her quadriplegic and cerebral palsy-stricken 21-year-old son in the woods for over four days. He was discovered on April 21, suffering from dehydration, malnutrition, eye problems, and a back injury. Parler cannot be extradited until she completes an unspecified treatment in Maryland. She is currently charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person, and related offenses in addition to attempted murder. Parler's son was last seen at his school, School of the Future, on April 21, and his absence raised concerns among school officials. Parler reportedly told her family and police that her son was with her in Maryland, but he was found alone in Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park. Parler's arrest is just the beginning of the investigation, and authorities are looking into how the man was cared for and the actions taken by various agencies.",

Investigators are looking into the possibility, said Goldsboro police Sgt. Jeremy Sutton. He did not explain what may have made it a hate crime. The victim -- Ron Lane, whom officials said was a longtime employee and the school's print shop operator -- was white, as is the suspect. Lane's relatives said he was gay, CNN affiliate WNCN reported. The suspect, Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, worked with Lane as part of a work-study program, but was let go from the program in early March due to poor attendance, college President Kay Albertson said Tuesday. On Monday, Stancil walked into the print shop on the third floor of a campus building, aimed a pistol-grip shotgun and fired once, killing Lane, according to Sutton. Stancil has tattoos on his face. Sutton said investigators are looking into whether he is part of a white supremacist gang. He has no previous criminal record, authorities said. Sutton said Stancil fled on a motorcycle after the shooting and ultimately abandoned it in a highway median. Then, Stancil continued on to Daytona, Florida, but authorities don't know how he traveled, Sutton said. He was arrested just after 1 a.m. Tuesday, after he was found sleeping on a beach, about 550 miles (885 kilometers) from Goldsboro. Volusia County Beach Patrol had approached him for violating the city's ordinance against sleeping on the beach. He had a knife, police said. He was taken into custody without incident. Authorities in North Carolina expect to bring him back to face charges. Wayne Community College, a two-year school, has a student population of 3,837, according 2013 figures from the National Center for Education Statistics. Slightly more than half the students are part-time. Crime statistics from the center's website show no killings, assaults, robberies or motor vehicle thefts between 2011 and 2013. There were three arrests for illegal weapons possession in 2012 and three in 2013.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 162 words:\nEmy Afalava is a loyal American and decorated veteran.  He was born in American Samoa, a U.S. territory since 1900. He has been subject to American law his whole life and thinks he should be a citizen. The Constitution would agree.  The Fourteenth Amendment declares that \"All persons born ... in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\" Yet, Afalava has been denied the right to vote because the federal government insists that he is no citizen.  How can it be, in the 21st century, that Americans born on U.S. soil are denied the rights of citizenship? That injustice clouds the recent celebration of the 115th anniversary of the decision of American Samoa to join the United States.  It is a wrong that Afalava and other American Samoans are now seeking to right in a federal lawsuit before the D.C. Circuit. A decision could come any day. Since the United States was established, it adhered to the rule that those born on U.S. lands were U.S. citizens.  The rule is colorblind, yet the only exception that the Supreme Court has ever declared was not. The infamous Dred Scott case legitimized slavery as it declared that free African-Americans had \"no rights that the white man was bound to respect.\"  Though they were Americans, they were not citizens under the Constitution. A Civil War later, the 14th Amendment reversed the ruling in the Dred Scott case. Today, the Dred Scott case has come to be regarded as one of the worst decisions in the history of the Supreme Court. But racial discrimination didn't end there. In 1904, a Puerto Rican woman named Isabel Gonzalez sailed for New York.  Because Puerto Rico was U.S. territory, she believed herself to be a U.S. citizen.  But officials at Ellis Island labeled her an undesirable alien and prevented her from entering the mainland.  She sued, with some reason to hope for a favorable ruling. Yet the Supreme Court that eventually heard Gonzalez's case was still racist.  In preceding years, for example, it had permitted a flat ban on naturalizing anyone of the Chinese race. And, in a case addressing the status of recently acquired island territories such as Puerto Rico, the justices had cited the alleged racial inferiority of tropical peoples as reason to treat these lands as second-class U.S. territories.  Justice Edward Douglas White's opinion stated that U.S. sovereignty extended over them, but that their residents did not hold the same constitutional rights as other Americans.  He did so, he privately revealed, because \"he was much preoccupied by the danger of racial and social questions.\" In the Gonzalez case, the justices agreed unanimously that Puerto Ricans were not aliens and thus not subject to immigration laws.  But they declined to decide whether or not Gonzalez was a citizen.  Though preoccupied by fears that islanders were \"savages\" and racially unfit for citizenship, they were unwilling to violate the Constitution. As a result of the court ruling, federal officials were able to deny Gonzalez and others the full panoply of rights conferred on citizens for years. As Isabel Gonzalez's lawyer told the Court, declaring that residents of America's island territories are not U.S. citizens would mean adding to \"precedents in our history of which we are least proud.\" Those precedents, he warned the Court, had been \"repudiated by the American people in the Civil War, by three amendments to the Constitution of the United States, by this court, and by ... advancing civilization.\" Surely, 147 years after the Dred Scott case was overturned, the time has come to put an end to this farce. In the past century, the inhabitants of every other U.S. island territory have become citizens. Today, Emy Afalava and his fellow American Samoans are the last Americans still waiting to become citizens.\n\noutput:",

This issue dates back to the late 19th and early 147 years ago when similar injustices were inflicted on free African-Americans in the Dred Scott case and Puerto Rican woman Isabel Gonzalez. These cases, rooted in racial discrimination, have been repudiated by the American people and the Constitution. Afalava and other American Samoans are now seeking to right this wrong in a federal lawsuit before the D.C. Circuit. A decision is pending.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nHillary Clinton finally answered the question we've all been asking for years: Will she run for president in 2016? With official news of her candidacy just hours old, one thing is already crystal clear: For the next year and a half, Clinton will be the barometer by which we assess gender equality in the United States. Win or lose, this creates a burden for her that no male candidate will ever have to shoulder. Just consider the two potential outcomes. A win would mean a woman in the White House, which is a vital step in the march toward women's full political inclusion. But it's possible that the march will end right there. We'll break our arms patting ourselves on the back for how far we've come. We'll raise the \"Mission Accomplished\" banner over the women's movement. And we'll call it a day. Granted, 80% of elected officials throughout the country will still be men. Women will continue to be less likely than men even to consider running for office. And pay inequities, sexual assault and human trafficking will persist as challenges that no one person can solve, no matter how hard Clinton might try. \"But we've elected a woman as president,\" we'll say. Let her take care of it. A loss would be even more difficult. Clinton will be blamed for running a subpar campaign regardless of how brilliant her strategy is. More generally, her loss would perpetuate the myth that women cannot win big elections, that the electoral environment is rife with bias and discrimination, and that women must be twice as good to get half as far. \"If Hillary Clinton can't win an election,\" potential female candidates will ask, \"How can I?\" Extrapolating from one female candidate's experiences to women in politics more broadly is always suspect. But in the case of Clinton, it is particularly flawed for at least two fundamental reasons. First, Clinton is no ordinary female presidential candidate, if there is such a thing. She began the 2008 race with levels of name recognition that many candidates never achieve, and she is even more well-known today. But that means that she also enters the electoral arena with 23 years of public accomplishments and 23 years of well-publicized baggage. Voters, donors, journalists and pundits all hold clear impressions of Clinton before she ever eats a corn dog in Iowa, steps onto a debate stage in New Hampshire or takes a shot of bourbon in Kentucky. Too often, we treat Clinton's loss to Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary as a referendum on how citizens feel about electing women to positions of political power. In reality, what people knew about Hillary Clinton likely shaped their views of Hillary Clinton. Widespread sexism and misogyny likely did not. After all, for decades, women who have run for office have performed just as well as men. They win elections at equal rates and routinely raise comparable amounts of money. Do some voters still question women's suitability as leaders? Of course they do. But these attitudes, which have become increasingly rare, do not translate into systematic biases against female candidates. Second, presidential politics is, first and foremost, a partisan affair. The D or R in front of the candidates' names -- not the X or Y chromosomes in their DNA -- tells us about how more than 90% of the population will vote. Party polarization has essentially rendered the importance of sex on the campaign trail far less relevant than might otherwise be the case. Now, I'll be the first to predict that by the middle of the week, we will be able to assemble a reel of sexist comments uttered by pundits, and we will be one mouse click away from a steady stream of misogynistic memes, photos and captions that have taken hold on social media. The Clinton campaign will once again have to determine which incidents to address, which to ignore and how to preempt future episodes. I don't want to diminish the problems associated with this type of behavior or the fact that it is inappropriate, disrespectful and appalling. And incorporating these concerns into a broad campaign strategy is likely something that male candidates won't need to consider. But men yelling \"Iron my shirt\" at a campaign rally, cable news pundits associating Clinton with their ex-wives outside of probate court and manufacturers producing Hillary Clinton nutcrackers do not change the fact that when it comes to presidential elections, partisanship and the state of the economy tell us almost everything we need to know. If Clinton wins the race, it will be because it was a good year for Democrats. And if she loses, it will be because the GOP developed a winning message. But how much does any of this really matter? Sure, voters are amenable to electing women. Any Democratic nominee would face the same electoral landscape. The problems confronting women in society are just as grave regardless of who occupies the White House. And inferring too much from Hillary Clinton's experiences is a risky endeavor. Yet the minute Clinton announced her candidacy, she became the official litmus test for true gender equality in the United States. That's a label that no female candidate should have to wear. Let the burden begin.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "Hillary Clinton's announcement of her 2016 presidential candidacy marks a significant milestone for gender equality in the United States. Regardless of the outcome, Clinton's campaign will serve as a barometer for women's political inclusion. A win would be a historic achievement, but may lead to complacency regarding ongoing gender disparities. A loss, on the other hand, could perpetuate the myth that women cannot win big elections and reinforce biases against female candidates. However, it's important to note that Clinton's experiences may not accurately represent all women in politics due to her unique background and the extensive public scrutiny she faces. Ultimately, presidential politics is primarily driven by partisanship and the state of the economy, rather than gender. Despite this, Clinton's campaign will undoubtedly face sexist comments and misogynistic attacks, which she and her team will need to address. Regardless of the outcome, Clinton's candidacy underscores the need for continued progress towards true gender equality.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nAfter two days of deliberation, jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on all counts in the Boston Marathon bombing. The verdict isn't surprising. What might be, however, is the answer to how we prevent this kind of violence from happening again. Because there could be other more young men just like him, which means the lessons we take from Boston will affect whether we can keep America and Americans safer. Today, nearly 1 out of 4 people in the world are Muslim. By 2050, Pew reports, that will be some 1 out of 3. By 2070? Well, I'll quote the all-caps headline reprinted by the Drudge Report: \"Muslims to outnumber Christians!\" Many Americans read such numbers and worry: Will this mean more Dzhokhar Tsarnaevs? But that's only if you believe Islam causes extremism, which many have argued. And that's wrong, of course. On the other hand, there are people who claim Islam has nothing to do with terrorism. Which is true — and false. Sure, the Islamic faith forbids murder, but there's a small but significant minority of Muslims murdering people in terrible ways, and in Islam's name. Understanding what leads young Muslims like Dzhokhar down a dangerous path requires we understand radicalization. At any given moment in the Middle East, we have little idea who's going to attack whom next, who's on whom's side, how this is going to end, or what anyone's even fighting over anymore. This bad news is going to turn worse before it gets better. But it will get better. To understand why, we have to take a stab at understanding what radicalizes Muslims. Contrary to common belief, Muslims aren't unusually predisposed to violence. Radical Islam, which has taken on an ugly life of its own, began at the intersection of politics, religion and religious identity. Islam is about what you believe, but it's also about being part of a community. And what happens when you are a member of a community and you see it under attack? Some Muslims who have turned to violence have done so with good intentions (the road to hell, after all). Consider: The tragedy of modern Islam is in its endless sequence of tragedies. Before my time, the brutal Soviet invasion of Afghanistan horrified many Muslims. When I was in high school, Bosnia occupied all our attention. There was of course Russia's brutal war on the Chechen people — Dzhokhar shares his name with a recent Chechen patriot --  and Israel's ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territories. And the blows against Muslims don't end there. There was Serbia's war on Kosovo, another war in Chechnya, the invasion of Iraq, oppression in Myanmar, civil strife in Syria, the colonization of East Turkestan, massacres of Muslims in the Central African Republic, wars on a besieged Gaza and West Bank still under Israeli rule. Imagine how this looks to a restless young Muslim. Countless places where co-religionists have been killed, and nobody seems to do anything about it. Nobody even wants to. Extremists have long offered crude reasons for why the violence was happening, and then moved quickly to a single, tempting, terrible response: Take up arms — and kill. In her new book, \"Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now\", Ayaan Hirsi Ali argues that extremism isn't caused by political circumstances, but by Islam itself. Her conclusion is wrong. To fight extremism, we don't need to reform Islam. We need to show young Muslims that extremism is doing the opposite of what it claimed to. Rather than help Muslims, it's harming them. When I was a teenager, our Massachusetts mosque hosted a delegation from Bosnia that shared graphic, heartbreaking stories of rape, exile, and massacre inflicted on Muslims, all because of their faith. The mosque raised money, collected food, blankets, medicine. Promises were made to provide more, and regularly. But we all knew that wasn't enough. As we left the mosque, my peers and I were disgruntled and confused. Shocked. Angry. Our teachers could've told us: Go and fight. Defend your Muslim brothers and sisters who are under siege. Or they could've told us to keep our heads down and make money and live comfortably. Neither answer would have satisfied. Fortunately for us, they offered us a third way. They showed us, patiently, how to work with others, how to compromise, how to get things done. A more engaged American Muslim community, they explained, could use its resources to help people suffering all around the world. They were right. We saw the dead-end road of radicalism from afar, but we also saw, up close, how communities that isolated themselves and turned inward found themselves powerless, ineffectual and ignored. Thanks to social media, a medium that the world's burgeoning young Muslim population is increasingly comfortable with, more Muslims can and will see this, too. Radicalism will be done in by fellow Muslims who want to save their religion from this monster within it.  It's happening already. Our national conversation about Islam is focused on the wrong issues. Does Islam need a Reformation? What in Islam causes violence?  We would do a lot better if we accepted that Muslims the world over have real grievances — dictatorships, corruption, foreign intervention, religious illiteracy, lack of economic opportunity -- and radicals exploit these. We need to show the young Dzhokhars that, if they want to help, then violence isn't going to help. To fight extremism, we need to pose this question to young Muslims: \"Do you want to help your brothers and sisters in faith?\"   Because those who claim to be defending us are making things so much worse. Their narrative has failed. Their solution is bankrupt. The Caliph wears no clothes. It's the reason why increasing numbers of Muslims reject extremism -- and not just because our numbers are increasing.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "The Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was found guilty on all counts after a two-day trial. The verdict does not come as a surprise, but preventing similar acts of violence in the future remains a challenge. With nearly 1 in 3 people projected to be Muslim by 2050, concerns about more potential Dzhokhar Tsarnaevs arise. However, it is essential to understand that radicalization is not exclusive to the Islamic faith. The root causes of radicalization lie at the intersection of politics, religion, and identity. Muslims, like any other community, are not inherently predisposed to violence. Instead, extremist groups exploit real grievances, such as political instability, corruption, foreign intervention, religious illiteracy, and lack of economic opportunities. To combat extremism, it is crucial to engage young Muslims and show them that violence is not an effective solution to help their co-religionists. The Muslim community itself is already taking steps to counter extremism, and this trend is expected to continue as more young Muslims become connected through social media. The focus of the national conversation should be on addressing the underlying causes of radicalization rather than stigmatizing the Islamic faith.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 154 words:\nThe new emojis are here! On Thursday, Apple released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race, ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis -- those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just won't cut it. The reaction to this new lineup is, as should be expected with almost anything new in today's hypersensitive climate, a range of cheers and jeers. Why is any of this important, you may ask? For many, these images are far more than tiny clip art for texting. Rather they are seen as recognition that their own ethnicity, sexual orientation, race or even hair color is part of mainstream America -- despite what others might say. This matters in a digital age where texting is how most people communicate and represent themselves dozens -- if not hundreds -- of times every day. Think receiving a text of an image of a person smiling. Or more accurately, think of a white face smiling because up until Thursday's update, all the emojis had pale skin. But that has all changed. Now there's a range of emoji skin tones to pick from, including yellow, brown and black.  I'm sure few people will be upset with this development. But how about in December? Why? Now that will be able to choose the skin tones for each human emoji, and that will also include ... Santa Claus. That shrieking sound you may have heard was from Fox News' Megyn Kelly, who famously stated in 2013 that Santa Claus is absolutely, definitely and without a doubt a white guy.  In fact, thanks to Apple, we may even see Brown Santa emojis this December. (Could that mean he's a Muslim Santa?! Cue even more shrieking from Fox News.) There is more. Apple has now given us gay and lesbian couple emojis, kissing with a heart over their heads. This inclusiveness was cheered by at least one gay news service on Twitter. It's not yet clear if a person who likes to use same-sex kissing emoji couples can be denied service by a person who objects on grounds of \"religious liberty.\" But it would be interesting to hear what any of the 2016 GOP presidential candidates might have to say about \"gay emojis.\" And I would predict some conservative will claim that the kissing gay emojis will turn children gay. The fact is, when you embrace diversity, you will still leave out other minority groups. Redheads, for example, are pretty pissed off because there are no emojis featuring their hair color. In fact, supporters of a redheaded emoji have started a petition that has already garnered several thousand signatures. Even expanding the flags represented by emojis, as Apple has done, comes at some peril. Apparently Canada is overjoyed that finally Apple has included it. But Armenians are not happy they were left out. I must admit that being partially of Palestinian heritage, it's heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a Palestinian state, Apple has chosen to now include a Palestinian flag emoji. Armenia, I feel your pain. Of course the bigger question in the whole diverse-emoji issue is: What took Apple so long? How hard could it have been to add different skin colors to pick from? That the company (finally) did is a step in the right direction: America's demographics are changing, so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this. Apple has \"evolved\" in showing diversity -- from brown people to same-sex couples. Maybe \"religious liberty\" conservatives who discriminate will follow.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "Apple recently updated its mobile operating system with more diverse emojis, including various skin tones and representations of different ethnicities, sexual orientations, and even Santa Claus. The new emojis have sparked a range of reactions, with some celebrating the recognition of their identities and others expressing opposition. The inclusion of diverse emojis is significant in a digital age where texting is prevalent, allowing individuals to represent themselves accurately. Controversies include the representation of Santa Claus and same-sex kissing emojis. Some groups, such as redheads and Armenians, feel excluded due to the lack of emojis representing their hair color or nationality. Apple's decision to include diverse emojis is seen as a step in the right direction, reflecting America's changing demographics. The question remains, however, as to why it took Apple so long to make this update.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nLaying down tracks for their debut album in the recording studio in Los Angeles, Iman Hashi, 25 and her sister Siham, 27 could not be further from their hometown of Mogadishu. The sisters were born in the Somali capital but were forced to flee after war broke out in 1991. Along with their parents, the girls relocated to Canada as refugees where during their teens they discovered a passion for music. Heading south to LA by way of Atlanta, the singing sisters with a bold flair for fashion are now embarking on a musical journey, gearing up to unleash their Afro-pop sound to the world. CNN's African Voices caught up with the sister act -- known collectively as Faarrow (combining the translation of their names into English -- Iman means \"Faith\" and Siham means \"Arrow\") to talk about music, aspirations and Somalia. CNN: Hi guys, thanks for chatting with me today. What are some of your musical influences? Iman: We love Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie -- stuff my mom would listen to and play -- and the Spice Girls. We used to die for the Spice Girls. I love new artists now but I don't know if it's a nostalgia, but I remember ... my mom used to pump whatever -- Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston. CNN: You are working on your debut album now -- how's that been? Siham: We've been working with Elijah Kelley -- he's actually an actor. He was in \"Hairspray,\" \"The Butler,\" and most recently he was in the George Lucas animation, \"Strange Magic.\" That's what he's more known for but his first passion is music. He's an incredible producer, writer and singer. I just felt like he was always the missing piece. He brought everything together. CNN: So now that you've found your \"missing piece,\" how would you describe your sound? Siham: Our music before was experimenting with Afrobeat sounds but now it's more of a fusion (of what) we are inspired by. It's pop with undertones of hip hop and rhythmic African percussion. It's a fusion of everything. CNN: And do you guys write the songs as well? Siham: The entire album was pretty much (written and produced) by me, my sister and Elijah. And when we signed we already had a lot of those songs already done. Warner Brothers Records is really great in that way that they already loved what we were doing and let us do our own thing. CNN: What are you listening to right now? Siham: Oh my God, there's so many! Iman: Sia with \"Chandelier.\" Siham: I really love this new song -- I don't know if Iman is going to agree with me -- but his name's LunchMoney Lewis, it's called Bills; I love it. CNN: As well as your music, you both work with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) -- how did you start your humanitarian work? Iman: Ever since we were kids we wanted to help Somalia, we always talked about it. But we were like \"what can we physically do?\" We were doing some research and we called our mom and she said 'You know you still have family over there. There's a refugee camp in Kenya and your great uncle and his kids live in a refugee camp.' And we did some research about Dadaab refugee camp, it's a massive camp that has taken in Sudanese refugees, Somali refugees, Rwandan refugees -- pretty much anywhere there was a conflict. Everybody fled to Dadaab. In the beginning (it was) pure advocacy talking about it on Twitter and Facebook. CNN: But then you decided to \"up your game\" as it were... Iman: Yes, then we started a non-profit and we'd do small benefit concerts in Toronto and in San Diego -- wherever there was a big Somali community we would do outreach but all we had was our singing, working with UNHCR in a capacity as a spokesperson. We headlined World Refugee Day at the Kennedy Center, as well as the Nansen Awards twice in Geneva. We felt like this platform of singing -- the bigger it gets, the more we can do. Siham: We obviously love fashion so we wanted to do our own socially conscious brand so we've been making these bracelets and necklaces called \"Wish Creatively.\" Wish stands for \"Women Internationally Selling Hope.\" We wanted to do a socially conscious brand where we sell these bracelets where it goes back to projects in Kenya or Somalia with women providing them with a sustainable income. CNN: So what's next for you two? Siham: We're actually in the mixing process right now. We still have a few (tracks) to finish up but the majority of the album is pretty much done. We want to turn it in as soon as possible so they can put together a rollout plan and get ready for the first single to drop. Iman: I don't feel like we ever lost that feeling like we're creative spokespersons for our generation as well as for Somalia. I feel like now because we followed our dreams it's like 'they're not just refugees anymore.' We don't have to become doctors so we can one day give back to Somalia and help rebuild -- it's such a beautiful dream but not ours. In our culture, anything creative is not really respected or appreciated. But I feel like now but even with our new deal we're still trucking along. I feel like we inspire people.

She steadied herself against the podium in the Fall River, Massachusetts, courtroom and occasionally paused. She was tired after more than two years of pain, punctuated Wednesday when her son's killer, Aaron Hernandez, was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Odin Lloyd was her first born, her only son. \"Odin was the backbone of the family. Odin was the man of the house. Odin was his sisters' keeper,\" Ward told Judge Susan Garsh, before Garsh sentenced the  former pro-football player. Lloyd was 27-years-old and working for a landscaping firm when he was killed in June 2013. He played football for the Boston Bandits, the oldest semi-pro team in Boston and the winner of four championships in the New England Football League, according to the team's website. His mother, sister, uncle and cousin described him as a champion of family, a gifted athlete and a hard worker with a sense of humor. They said he rode his bike several miles to get to work. He went to all of his niece's recitals. \"Odin was my first best gift I (will) ever receive,\" his mother said. \"I thank God (for) every second and every day of my son's life that I spent with him. \"The day I laid my son Odin to rest,\" she continued, pausing to maintain her composure, \"I think my heart stopped beating for a moment. I felt like I wanted to go into that hole with my son, Odin.\" She can still hear him talking to her: \"'Ma, did you cook? Ma, go to bed. Ma, you're so beautiful.'\" Ed Lloyd followed Ward to address the judge. Odin Lloyd's uncle thanked everyone who worked on the case against Hernandez. His nephew, he said, \"meant a lot to me.\" \"To see how he grew, the respect he had, the toughest thing for me is that I won't get to see him have a child...,\" Ed Lloyd said. He loved watching his nephew and his son together. \"A lot of people won't see from the outside the value and the riches (Odin Lloyd) had,\" he said. \"I'm sorry for where I stand today but I know that all the time I had with him was special and he'll always be with me.\" Who was Odin Lloyd? Odin Lloyd's sister Olivia Thibou wept as she explained what it has felt like to lose her brother. \"These last couple years have been the hardest of our lives,\" she said, recalling that she was asked to writer her brother's eulogy.  \"I got to write all the great memories I have of him.\" She laughed, recalling his insistence on wearing the same Adidas flip-flops until the soles wore away. He was \"prideful,\" she said. He would take her car out and just when she was starting to angry, he'd pull in with the car shining and clean, inside and out. He taught her daughter how to ride a bike. His murder, she said, \"feels like a bad dream.\" Ward told the court that she constantly thinks about her son. \"I miss my baby boy Odin so much,\" she said. \"But I know I'm going to see him again someday and that has given me the strength to go on.\" She has also apparently gained strength from the act of forgiveness. \"I forgive the hands of the people that had a hand in my son's murder,\" she said. \"I pray and hope that someday everyone out there will forgive them also.\" What's next for Aaron Hernandez?\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "Ursula Ward, the mother of Odin Lloyd, expressed her grief and love for her only son during the sentencing of his killer, Aaron Hernandez, in a Massachusetts courtroom. Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old landscaper and semi-pro football player, was killed in 2013. His family described him as the backbone of the family, a gifted athlete, and a hard worker with a strong sense of humor. Ward and Lloyd's uncle, Ed, addressed the judge, expressing their loss and appreciation for those involved in the case against Hernandez. Lloyd's sister, Olivia Thibou, shared memories of her brother and the impact of his murder on their family. Hernandez was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 113 words:\nArsenal kept their slim hopes of winning this season's English Premier League title alive by beating relegation threatened Burnley 1-0 at Turf Moor. A first half goal from Welsh international Aaron Ramsey was enough to separate the two sides and secure Arsenal's hold on second place. More importantly it took the north London club to within four points of first placed Chelsea, with the two clubs to play next week. But Chelsea have two games in hand and play lowly Queens Park Rangers on Sunday, a team who are themselves struggling against relegation. Good form. Arsenal have been in superb form since the start of the year, transforming what looked to be another mediocre season struggling to secure fourth place -- and with it Champions League qualification -- into one where they at least have a shot at winning the title. After going ahead, Arsenal rarely looked in any danger of conceding, showing more of the midfield pragmatism epitomized by the likes of Francis Coquelin, who also played a crucial role in the goal. \"He has been absolutely consistent in the quality of his defensive work,\" Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports after the game when asked about Coquelin's contribution to Arsenal's current run. They have won eight games in a  row since introducing the previously overlooked young Frenchman into a more defensive midfield position. \"He was a player who was with us for seven years, from 17, he's now just 24,\" Wenger explained. \"Sometimes you have to be patient. I am very happy for him because he has shown great mental strength.\" Now all eyes will be on next week's clash between Arsenal and Chelsea which will likely decide the title. \"They have the games in hand,\" said Wenger, playing down his club's title aspirations. \"But we'll keep going and that's why the win was so important for us today.\" Relegation dogfight. Meanwhile it was a good day for teams at the bottom of the league. Aston Villa continued their good form since appointing coach Tim Sherwood with a 1-0 victory over Tottenham, who fired Sherwood last season. Belgian international Christian Benteke scored the only goal of the game, his eighth in six matches, to secure a vital three points to give the Midlands club breathing space. Another Midlands club looking over their shoulder is West Brom, who conceded an injury time goal to lose 3-2 against bottom club Leicester City. But it was an awful day for Sunderland's former Dutch international coach Dick Advocaat, who saw his team lose 4-1 at home against form team Crystal Palace. Democratic Republic of Congo international Yannick Bolasie scored Crystal Palace's first ever hat trick in the Premier League to secure an easy victory.\n\noutput:",

She was 75. \"Cynthia Lennon passed away today at her home in Mallorca, Spain, following a short but brave battle with cancer.  Her son Julian Lennon was at her bedside throughout,\" his website says.  \"The family are thankful for your prayers. Please respect their privacy at this difficult time.\" John and Cynthia Lennon were married for six years, from 1962 to 1968. The pair met at art school, where Cynthia studied to be an illustrator and John practiced painting -- in between concerts with a band that would become the Beatles. \"When we were at art college, I think he was more interested in the music than he was in the art,\" she told ClassicBands.com. Cynthia Lennon, born Cynthia Powell in 1939, was a stabilizing force for the young John, who lost his mother when he was a teenager and was raised by his Aunt Mimi. \"John was always insecure,\" she said in a 2005 interview, having lost his mother at a young age. But his humor -- and his wildness -- were attractive, she told ClassicBands.com. \"He was a rebel. He was outrageous. That was something I hadn't experienced before the age that I was, which was about 16 or 17. I'd had quite a normal, straightforward life,\" she said. \"I was just instantly attracted to him.\" The two married in 1962, just as the Beatles were making their rise. Their son, Julian, was born April 8, 1963. Lennon's sometimes-brittle personality and his overwhelming fame became a challenge for Cynthia. During her pregnancy, \"I was not supposed to be known or heard about. In the wisdom, or lack of wisdom, anything to do with somebody becoming famous, male, was not supposed to be married or have (a) girlfriend.\" She was threatened by fans and occasionally in danger of being left behind in the band's whirlwind; when the group traveled to Bangor, Wales, to meet with the Maharishi in 1967, Cynthia was caught in a scrum and couldn't make the train in time. She was also there on the 1965 night George Harrison, Patti Boyd and Lennon were dosed with LSD -- an experience she disliked -- and traveled to India with the band in early 1968. The couple divorced in 1968, by which time John was seeing Yoko Ono. Cynthia Lennon married three more times after John and wrote two books about her marriage to the Beatle, \"A Twist of Lennon\" and \"John.\" She had no contact with the surviving members of the band until meeting up at the 2006 Las Vegas premiere of \"The Beatles Love.\" For all the difficulties and disappointments -- she described Julian, for whom she wrote \"John,\" as \"very scarred by life\" -- she acknowledged that the whirlwind could also be enthralling. \"The whole situation changed my life completely. God knows where I would've been ended up. I probably would've been a schoolteacher with about three or four children in a boring situation,\" she told ClassicBands.com. \"I've had the most amazing life, a wonderful life.\" She is survived by her son. Her fourth husband, Noel Charles, died in 2013. People we've lost in 2015. CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this story.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nTen years ago, a prosecutor in Centre County, Pennsylvania, took a day off work and vanished. Since then, the case of Ray Gricar has become one of the most intriguing and talked about missing persons stories in the country. Investigators have taken dives to the bottom of lakes, dug up a grave, chased more than 300 reported sightings from Arizona to North Carolina, dropped fliers over Slovenia, consulted a psychic, interviewed a member of the Hell's Angels and enlisted NASA technology. But no one has been able to find the veteran district attorney, who was 59 when he disappeared. When he went missing that Friday morning on April 15, 2005, he left behind a live-in girlfriend, a beautiful and successful daughter and a bank account that was supposed to fund a fast-approaching retirement. His red Mini Cooper was found abandoned near a bridge on the Susquehanna River about 55 miles away from his home. Months later his county-issued laptop and hard drive were found -- separately -- on the banks of the river, too damaged to read. As far as hard evidence goes, that's about all police have. The best lead they got was the sighting of a woman who has not been identified, and information that he had searched online for ways to destroy a hard drive. What's left is theory, speculation and a case that's been cold almost from the beginning. \"When a district attorney goes missing, you know, it's pretty big. It's going to catch people's attention. A lot of people don't have a large footprint. This guy had influential friends, he was well known,\" said Todd Matthews, director of communications and case management for the National Missing and Unidentified Person System, or NamUs. From the start, investigators have considered three possibilities: Gricar committed suicide, fell victim to foul play or deliberately walked away. The prevailing theories have been suicide or walk-away, especially since 2009, when a search of his Google history on his home computer found that someone had been searching \"how to fry a hard drive\" and \"water damage to a notebook computer.\" Gricar, a private and quiet man, was spotted with a woman who was not his girlfriend the day he went missing, and cigarette ash was found near his car, even though he was not a smoker. Friends and colleagues recalled him being distant in the weeks that led up to his disappearance, and recounted his fascination with another law enforcement official from Ohio who vanished in 1985. Matthews said that NamUs has compared Gricar's DNA to unidentified bodies nine times since the database became available in 2009, but so far, none has been a match. \"Even if he chose to make himself go missing, it sounds like something was terribly wrong that caused a drastic change in his life. There's something wrong if he's Googled how to fry a hard drive. Did he Google it? Did someone else Google it? Was he threatened? Did he do something and is trying to cover it up? It's not a normal thing to Google that.\" Matt Rickard, the former investigator who had been in charge of the investigation for several years, thinks that hard drive is the key to cracking the case. He said he's still holding out hope that someday technology will allow investigators to recover the damaged data. \"I think there is something out there. Whether it's evidence or a person, there's something that could lead us to something,\" he said. \"In all honesty, somebody destroyed the hard drive and there was a reason. We have very few solid leads and the biggest one could be contained on that hard drive.\" In 2011, when former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky was arrested and charged with sexually abusing boys, it was revealed that it was Gricar who decided not to charge Sandusky when the first victim came forward in 1998. Gricar cited a lack of evidence. The intrigue already simmering in Gricar's case exploded. Sleuths desperately tried to find a link between the two cases, but investigators said there was no evidence that Gricar's disappearance had anything to do with Sandusky's crimes. But some have stuck to the homicide theory, suggesting that Gricar was an enemy of mob-like gangs in central Pennsylvania who were upset at his drug and corruption prosecutions. Cyril Wecht, a forensic pathologist, said he considered writing a book about Gricar, his ties to the Sandusky case, and whether it led to suicide. But, Wecht said, he abandoned the book idea when it became clear there was not enough evidence. \"I don't think it's a great stretch,\" Wecht said. \"He was one of those guys with a very strong sense of justice and professional discipline and in light of what evolved and came to be disclosed -- I speak as a forensic pathologist who's done so many suicides over the years and what can bring someone to that point. It's pure conjecture, not based on any factual knowledge.\" Plus, Wecht said, if it was a suicide, \"I don't understand how they never recovered the body.\" Bob Buehner, a former district attorney in Montour County, Pennsylvania, who was Gricar's friend, has never accepted a suicide or walk-away theory. He believes his colleague was killed. Buehner has doubts that, 10 years later, state police can recover from what he considers a bungled start to the case. \"It didn't seem like there was any overall game plan that made sense in terms of a systematic investigation,\" Buehner said. \"One of the things I'd asked them to do from the first couple weeks is now impossible to do -- to do a hotel-motel canvas looking for the mystery woman seen with Ray and then match the names with photo IDs which police have access to.\" Buehner said those records are now gone and his faith in finding Gricar is dwindling. \"I give it a 50-50 at best and only because I'm an optimist and I hope that's what will happen,\" he said. \"As a pessimist, maybe 1 in 10 that we'll find him.\" Despite fresh eyes on the investigation when it was handed over to state authorities last year, the mystery woman has not been found. \"Pennsylvania State Police continue to chase down new leads and take a fresh look at old leads and we continue to hold out hope that something will break out in this case,\" said Centre County's District Attorney Stacy Parks Miller. \"Everybody, regardless of what position they held, deserves this kind of attention. In any missing persons case, he's not the only one, we feel discouraged when we can't answer the questions for the family, but it doesn't change our dedication to the case.\" The case has gotten significant attention on the national level, appearing on several true-crime television shows, including HLN's \"Nancy Grace.\" So it was strange to many in Pennsylvania that for years a case with such a high profile would be handled by the tiny Bellefonte Police Department, where one investigator was assigned to juggle Gricar's case along with several more. In 2014, the state police took over, but that was nine years after Gricar went missing and two years after he had been declared legally dead. Sources close to the investigation told CNN the case, as state police received it, was disorganized and porous. Evidence had been compromised in storage. Reports were missing. Evidence had been collecting dust in file cabinets. There was never a forensic audit of his finances. Today, some of Gricar's friends believe the case is damaged beyond repair. They have lost faith that there will ever be any answers. When asked if she thought things might change when state police got the case, Barbara Gray, his ex-wife and the mother of his daughter Lara, said no. \"The evidence is the same,\" she said. Lara declined to comment, and investigators said they've had trouble reaching her. \"There is always a remote possibility that we might never have an answer,\" said Lt. James Emigh, who leads the investigation for the Pennsylvania State Police after inheriting it last year. \"We still hold out hope, and the state police will however continue to diligently follow up every possible lead and attempt to bring closure to the family and friends of Ray.\"\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "In 2005, Pennsylvania prosecutor Ray Gricar, 59, went missing, leaving behind his live-in girlfriend, a successful daughter, and a retirement fund. His red Mini Cooper was found near a bridge on the Susquehanna River, and his county-issued laptop and hard drive were later discovered on the riverbanks, both damaged and unreadable. The investigation into his disappearance has been ongoing for ten years, with theories ranging from suicide to foul play. The best lead was a sighting of an unidentified woman. Gricar's Google search history showed he had looked up ways to destroy a hard drive. Friends and colleagues reported that he had been distant in the weeks leading up to his disappearance and was fascinated with another law enforcement official who vanished in 1985. The National Missing and Unidentified Person System (NamUs) has compared Gricar's DNA to unidentified bodies nine times but has not found a match. Investigators are still holding out hope that technology will allow them to recover data from the damaged hard drive. The case gained national attention when it was revealed that Gricar had decided not to charge Jerry Sandusky for sexual abuse in 1998 due to a lack of evidence. However, there is no evidence linking the two cases. The investigation was handed over to state police in 2009, but it",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nWest of Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)The call from Faleh Essawi, the deputy chief of the provincial council, who we were supposed to be meeting up with, came just as we were about to hit the bridge -- the only safe route from Baghdad to neighboring Anbar province. \"ISIS has taken the east of the city, it's not accessible,\" he says, sounding frantic, rapidly rattling off the neighborhoods and areas ISIS fighters had just stormed into. Moments later, we see the impact: An endless stream of humanity, shell shocked, and exhausted. Parents cradle babies in blankets, some struggle under the weight of their belongings, some carry small plastic bags, while others nothing but the children clutching at their hands. Cars are not permitted to cross this bridge across the Euphrates. The government feels that restricting vehicles will decrease the likelihood of explosives making their way into Iraq's capital. Those too young or too tired to walk pile into metal carts pushed by boys or young men, normally used to carry produce to markets. An elderly woman sits in one, a child in her arms, a worn down plastic doll in her hand. Many don't want to talk, at least not for long. What they just went through is too raw, too painful. One man we encounter describes how ISIS fighters commandeered his house. \"We heard clashes in the early morning, and we couldn't see the security forces anywhere,\" he recalls. \"We saw the ISIS fighters, they just came into the house, they didn't say a word. They just sent a sniper to the roof.  I grabbed my children and ran.\" His wife bursts into tears, prompting him to apologize for not being able to talk anymore -- they just want to keep going. Another older woman, sitting in one of the carts surrounded by her grandchildren, starts sobbing the moment we approach her. \"They took our homes and kicked us out,\" she cries. Over the weekend ISIS moved into towns just to the north of Ramadi, which lies 68 miles (110km) west of Baghdad, sending thousands fleeing on foot into the city.  ISIS had already blocked off access from the south months ago, and the west was contested territory.  The east, until now, was not just a relatively safe zone but the only viable entrance and exit. At a hospital in Amriyat al-Falluja, about a 15-minute drive away, a wounded local fighter winces in pain. He was shot by a sniper in Ramadi that morning as ISIS fighters advanced -- the bullet barely missed his heart. \"We had been warning we could see their movements,\" he tells us. \"But we just didn't have the force to hold them off.  We didn't leave a single person we didn't call and ask for back up.\" But none came. Hours after our morning conversation we speak to Essawi again by phone. \"Security is collapsing in the city,\" he screams. \"This is what we warned Baghdad would happen. Where is Baghdad? Where is al-Abadi? \"Just God knows if we will survive this,\" he says and hangs up. Amriyat al-Falluja regularly comes under attack from rockets and mortars from ISIS positions nearby. The hospital's façade is scarred by shrapnel. The wards are full of people injured during these attacks. Fifteen-year-old Mustafa Ahmed has bandages on his neck, leg, and other parts of his body. \"A mortar fell on our street, one of my neighbors was wounded,\" he explains. \"We went out to help him and the second one fell on us.\" His friend died, he says. In the next room Amal Ahmed speaks softly. \"I was in the garden and a rocket hit and the shrapnel sliced me open,\" she says, as tears roll down her face. \"Something fell out of me and I grabbed it and I put it back in and I lay down.\" She starts to cry harder. Her husband was killed by U.S. forces in Fallujah -- another city in Anbar -- in 2003.  Her children have all moved away except her youngest, who broke his arm in the same attack. \"When I see the situation I don't have hope, it's just getting worse.\" A few moments later, we hear two massive explosions from another of the hospital's buildings. They think it's an ISIS rocket or mortar attack so we take cover along with the Iraqi forces we are with in the hallway, away from the windows. More explosions go off in the distance. Then another actually shakes our building. \"Anyone want tea?\" one of the policemen with us asks, laughing as he pours.  \"This happens all the time, we're used to it.\" The police chief, Major Aref al-Janabi, radios to his men to respond.  Al-Janabi, like so many others, is frustrated with the lack of support from Baghdad.  Earlier, he had taken us to the front lines, a long berm that stretches along the northern and western parts of the town that is dotted with fighting positions.  He says he regularly provides the joint command center with coordinates for ISIS positions, but so far there have been no significant air strikes or reinforcements. More explosions follow in the distance. We're quickly moved out and leave the town, heading back towards the bridge and the long, snaking lines of refugees. An ambulance passes us, trying to force its way through the crowds.  The swell of people fleeing has grown considerably in the last hours -- not surprising given Essawi's dire assessment and warning. \"Ramadi is under siege from all sides,\" he'd told us earlier, anger mixed with an air of resignation. \"I consider the city to have fallen.\" He claimed that 150,000 have fled, scoffing at statements from Iraqi officials in Baghdad that reinforcements have been sent to Ramadi.  He has yet to see them.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 85 words:\nWashington (CNN)In a broad bipartisan vote, the Senate on Tuesday gave final approval to a Medicare reform bill that includes a permanent solution to the \"doc fix,\" a method the government has used to ensure payments to Medicare providers will keep up with inflation. The bill, which passed 92 to 8, also includes a two-year extension of a popular children's health insurance program. The issue of payments to Medicare providers has been a thorny issue for years.  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah called passage of the bill a \"major, major accomplishment.\" \"Tonight, the Senate is voting to retire the outdated, inefficiency-rewarding, common sense-defying Medicare reimbursement system,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee just before the final vote. The House approved the same bill overwhelmingly more than two weeks ago and President Barack Obama is expected to sign it.  Senate passage came just hours before cuts to physicians would have taken place since the last temporary \"doc fix\" had already expired. Some conservative senators, including Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz of Texas, balked at the more than $200 billion price of the bill and pushed an amendment to have the costs offset. The bill, \"institutionalizes and expands Obamacare policies that harm patients and their doctors while adding roughly half a trillion dollars to our long-term debt within two decades,\" Cruz said in a statement.  \"Any deal should be fully paid for and include significant and structural reforms to Medicare.\" But that amendment was defeated, as were several others from each party that came up for votes. Earlier, House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio warned the Senate not to change the bill. \"Unless the Senate passes the House-passed 'doc fix,' significant cuts to physicians' payments will begin tomorrow,\" Boehner said.  \"We urge the Senate to approve the House-passed bill without delay.\" Cruz voted against the bill, as did Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another Republican running for president. GOP presidential contender Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted for the bill.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "The Senate, in a 85-8 bipartisan vote, passed a Medicare reform bill that includes a permanent solution to the \"doc fix\" and a two-year extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program. The $200 billion bill also faced opposition from some senators, including Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, due to its cost and expansion of Obamacare policies. The House had already approved the bill, and President Obama is expected to sign it before physician payment cuts take effect.",

The Georgian chess grandmaster has been banned from the Dubai Open Chess Tournament after officials discovered he was darting to the toilet to consult his smartphone, which was logged onto a chess analysis app, the Dubai Chess and Culture Club said. Nigalidze's opponent, Tigran Petrosian of Armenia, grew suspicious when Nigalidze kept bolting to the restroom. \"The Armenian noticed the Georgian was oddly frequenting the toilet after each move during a crucial part of the game,\" the Dubai Chess and Culture Club said. When officials first checked Nigalidze, they didn't find any device on him, the club said. But after looking into the bathroom stall he visited, they found the smartphone hidden in toilet paper. At first, Nigalidze claimed the smartphone wasn't his, the Dubai chess organization said. But the phone was logged on to a social media network under his account. \"They also found his game being analyzed in one of the chess applications,\" the chess club said. The infraction has been reported to the International Chess Federation. The Dubai tournament's chief arbiter, Mahdi Abdul Rahim, said players found guilty of cheating will be suspended for three years from all sanctioned tournaments and up to 15 years for a repeated offense, the chess and culture club said. But this wouldn't be an isolated case of cheating in high-stakes chess matches. In 2008, an Iranian player was banned from the Dubai Open after getting help from someone who was watching the game's live broadcast and was sending suggestions via text messages, the Dubai chess club said. Nigalidze's resume includes victories in the 2013 and 2014 Georgian Chess Championships. It's not clear how many times he went to the bathroom during those matches.\n\noutput:",

It has been 42 days since the last known case of B3 strain of measles, the equivalent of two successive incubation periods, said Dr. Karen Smith, director of the health department. The department said in its latest update that 131 people came down with the B3 strain, and five who had a different genotype than the outbreak strain. Of the 131 cases, the state was able to obtain the vaccination status for 81 patients. Of the 81, 70% were unvaccinated. \"Prompt investigation of cases, interviewing hundreds of contacts of infected people, vaccinating hundreds of at risk people, and increasing awareness among health care providers about measles, helped to control this outbreak,\" Smith said. The outbreak began with dozens of visitors to two Disney theme parks in the state. The health department said 42 of the cases occurred from December 17-20. Two patients with rashes have been identified in April, but they have a different measles genotype. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its website that 19 different strains have been discovered since 1990. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease. It causes fever, red and sore eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash. It can cause deadly health complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis. It  is spread by contact with an infected person through coughing or sneezing. It can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours.

By 1950, all unidentified remains were laid to rest as unknowns at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific.

Emory, a native of Peoria, Illinois, was serving as a seaman first class on the light cruiser USS Honolulu that fateful day. After the war, Emory worked in Washington state before moving to Hawaii about 30 years ago. The retiree made it his mission to ensure graves are properly identified. \"It's something I looked forward to for a long time,\" he told CNN about Tuesday's announcement. Speaking by phone from Honolulu, Emory said that proper identification means a lot to the families of those who lost loved ones -- and to him. Next of kin were being notified starting Tuesday.

Its 573 students, all male, are staying home after Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta announced three days of national mourning following last week's deadly attack at a nearby university. Only a few kilometers away, 147 people -- mostly students -- were brutally massacred when Al-Shabaab militants invaded the campus in Garissa, a town in northeastern Kenya. We've come to this particular Islamic religious school because the man suspected by Kenyan authorities of being the \"mastermind\" behind the atrocity -- Mohamed Mohamud -- once taught here. \"He was someone who was very quiet, he didn't like too much talk,\" recalls Sheikh Khalif Abdi Hussein, the principal at the Madrassa. He says he also taught with Mohamud for two years. \"When he left the Madrassa, he joined Al-Shabaab. But before, he was normal, just like me and other people.\" What worries authorities here is exactly that -- Mohamud was Kenyan. But now, say officials, Mohamud is in command of an Al-Shabaab militia based near Kenya's long, porous border with Somalia -- about 118 miles (190km) from Garissa -- who are believed to be responsible for numerous cross-border attacks into Kenya. The Islamist militant group, who are allied with al Qaeda, have been waging a bloody campaign for control of Somalia. With Kenyan troops part of an African Union force deployed in support of Somalia's United Nations-supported government, Kenya has now become a target. Last year, an attack by Al-Shabaab on a shopping center in the country's capital, Nairobi, claimed the lives of 68 people. Now Mohamud stands accused of being behind Thursday's attack -- the deadliest attack in the nation since al Qaeda killed more than 200 people at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998. But Mohamud is not Kenya's only homegrown terrorist. The Kenyan Interior Ministry has said at least one of the four gunmen who carried out the attack on the university was also Kenyan. Abdirahim Abdullahi was in his 20s and the son of a government chief. His father says he lost contact with his son in 2013, shortly after he left university. The Kenyan government is concerned that Al-Shabaab is recruiting disaffected youth from inside the country. \"Our task of countering terrorism has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities,\" President Kenyatta said during an address to the nation in the aftermath of the massacre. Meanwhile, Sheikh Khalif insists his Madrassa has nothing to do with Mohamud's extreme, violent ideas. \"This man is a dangerous man, a killer, a criminal,\" he says. But he was also once a neighbor. And so Kenyans must now look within to tackle this very real threat to the country's -- and the region's -- stability.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nIt's not easy being the Pope. Not only does he shepherd nearly 1 billion Catholic souls, he also leads a small but morally significant state with envoys and interests in nearly every country. As scholars like to say, the Vatican has walked the line between spiritual and worldly concerns for centuries. Sometimes, as when St. John Paul II stood up to Communist Poland, the church's moral and political clout have combined to pack a powerful punch. At other times, popes have to make a hard choice: Adopt the sharp tongue of a prophet or the discretion of a diplomat? This Sunday in Rome, Pope Francis faced just such a dilemma. First, the back story:. One hundred years ago, more than 1 million Armenians (some estimates run as high as 1.5 million) died at the hand of the Turks. Many of the victims were part of a branch of Christianity closely aligned with Catholicism. A slew of  historians and at least 20 countries call the killings a \"genocide.\" (A U.S. resolution to do the same has languished in Congress.) Turkish officials disagree, arguing that the deaths, while unfortunate, were part of a long-running war that witnessed casualties on all sides. For their part, previous popes had finessed the genocide question. John Paul II used the \"g\" word in 2001, but didn't dare speak it out loud. Instead, it was tucked into a document signed by the former pontiff and the head of the Armenian church, after they had celebrated Mass together. Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI called the killings \"a great evil\" and \"terrible persecution\" in a speech 2006, but avoided labeling them genocide. (Benedict found other ways to tick off the Turks, initially opposing their entry into the European Union.) As Pope Francis prepared to celebrate a special Mass Sunday to commemorate a century since the slaughter,  Vatican watchers were divided about whether he would use the word \"genocide.\" He did, but in a roundabout way, by quoting John Paul's document. \"In the past century, our human family has lived through three massive and unprecedented tragedies,\" Francis said. \"The first, which is widely considered 'the first genocide of the 20th century,' struck your own Armenian people.\" The middle phrase comes directly from the document issued 14 years ago by John Paul. In citing his predecessor, Francis highlighted one of the Vatican's chiefest concerns, especially on matters of moral import: continuity. Whether holding the line against artificial birth control, declining to ordain female priests or dealing with diplomatic tensions, it sometimes seems as if the church considers inconsistency the most unforgivable of sins. \"The Vatican and the papacy love continuity,\" said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a Vatican analyst for National Catholic Reporter. If Francis had not called the Armenian killings a genocide, particularly at such a high-profile event -- the audience included Armenia's President -- it might have been interpreted as a change in church policy, Reese said. At the same time, Francis didn't want to anger the Turks more than necessary, especially since they have become a key ally against the persecution of Christians by ISIS in the Middle East, which the Pope alluded to in his speech on Sunday. \"The fact that he quoted John Paul is a sign that he's downplaying it,\" Reese said of the Armenian murders. \"He's telling people: There's nothing new here.\" New or not, Turkey was not happy. The nation recalled its Vatican ambassador for \"consultations\" just hours after Francis' comments, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. Turkey also promptly summoned his counterpart, the Vatican's ambassador, for a meeting, Turkish state broadcaster TRT reported. In a tweet Sunday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called the Pope's use of the word \"unacceptable\" and \"out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis.\" \"Religious authorities are not places through which hatred and animosity are fueled by unfounded allegations,\" the tweet reads. \"Hatred\" and \"animosity\" are not words often used to describe Pope Francis. Because he often shines a sympathetic face on the world, emphasizing mercy over judgment, it's easy to miss the bluntness Francis brings to the bully pulpit. On matters of doctrine and diplomacy, he may be carrying on Catholic traditions, but in his willingness to engage in geopolitics and the tone that engagement often takes, this pope is decidedly different. He has helped broker a backroom detente between the United States and Cuba, and invited Israeli and Palestinian leaders for an unprecedented prayer service at the Vatican (after annoying some Israelis with an impromptu prayer at the wall that separates the West Bank from Jerusalem.) But Francis has also suggested that force may be justified to stop ISIS' slaughter of Christians, warned of the \"Mexicanization\" of Argentina and said that satirists who insult religion should expect a retaliatory punch. On Monday, the Pope addressed a roomful of priests at morning Mass. He must have heard the hubbub about his \"genocide\" remark, but he encouraged his charges to speak frankly, without fear, and to bear the courage of their convictions, just as the early apostles had. \"We cannot keep silent about what we have seen and heard,\" Francis said. CNN's Gul Tuysuz  and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "The Pope, as the spiritual leader of nearly 1 billion Catholics and the head of the small but influential Vatican state, often faces the challenge of balancing spiritual and worldly concerns. This past Sunday, Pope Francis had to decide whether to use a strong moral stance or diplomatic discretion regarding the 100-year-old killing of over 1 million Armenians, which some consider a genocide. Previous popes have avoided labeling the event as such, but Francis quoted John Paul II's description of it as the \"first genocide of the 14th century\" during a Mass commemorating the tragedy. This decision was significant as it could be perceived as a change in church policy, but Francis also did not want to anger Turkey, a key ally against the persecution of Christians in the Middle East. Turkey recalled its ambassador to the Vatican and summoned the Vatican's ambassador in response to Francis' use of the word \"genocide.\"",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 157 words:\nWhen Etan Patz went missing in New York City at age 6, hardly anyone in America could help but see his face at their breakfast table. His photo's appearance on milk cartons after his May 1979 disappearance marked an era of heightened awareness of crimes against children. On Friday, more than 35 years after frenzied media coverage of his case horrified parents everywhere, a New York jury will again deliberate over a possible verdict against the man charged in his killing, Pedro Hernandez. He confessed to police three years ago. Etan Patz's parents have waited that long for justice, but some have questioned whether that is at all possible in Hernandez's case. His lawyer has said that he is mentally challenged, severely mentally ill and unable to discern whether he committed the crime or not. Hernandez told police in a taped statement that he lured Patz into a basement as the boy was on his way to a bus stop in Lower Manhattan. He said he killed the boy and threw his body away in a plastic bag. Neither the child nor his remains have ever been recovered. But Hernandez has been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and has an \"IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range,\" his attorney Harvey Fishbein has said. Police interrogated Hernandez for 7½ hours before he confessed. \"I think anyone who sees these confessions will understand that when the police were finished, Mr. Hernandez believed he had killed Etan Patz. But that doesn't mean he actually did, and that's the whole point of this case,\" Fishbein has said. But in November, a New York judge ruled that Hernandez's confession and his waiving of his Miranda rights were legal, making the confession admissible in court. Another man's name has also hung over the Patz case for years -- Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's babysitter. Etan's parents, Stan and Julia Patz, sued Ramos in 2001. The boy was officially declared dead as part of that lawsuit. A judge found Ramos responsible for the boy's death and ordered him to pay the family $2 million -- money the Patz family has never received. Though Ramos was at the center of investigations for years, he has never been charged. He served a 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania for molesting another boy and was set to be released in 2012. He was reportedly immediately rearrested upon exiting jail in 2012 on failure to register as a sex offender. Since their young son's disappearance, the Patzes have worked to keep the case alive and to create awareness of missing children in the United States. In the early 1980s, Etan's photo appeared on milk cartons across the country, and news media focused in on the search for him and other missing children. \"It awakened America,\" said Ernie Allen, president and chief executive officer of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. \"It was the beginning of a missing children's movement.\" The actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it's always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed, experts said. But the news industry was expanding to cable television, and sweet images of children appeared along with destroyed parents begging for their safe return. The fear rising across the nation sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police. In 1984, Congress passed the Missing Children's Assistance Act, which led to the creation of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. Former President Ronald Reagan opened the center in a White House ceremony in 1984. It soon began operating a 24-hour toll-free hot line on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls. Joe Sterling and CNN's Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nA jury of Rolling Stone's media peers has dissected the magazine's disastrous, discredited story about rape on the campus of the University of Virginia, and the emerging consensus is that Rolling Stone's lapses and sloppy blunders amount to journalistic malpractice -- made all the worse by the magazine's head-in-the sand reaction to the thorough, devastating report released by a panel of investigators from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Rolling Stone's egregious mistakes of reporting and editing are regrettable but understandable. The magazine's decision not to fire anybody or reorganize its newsroom operation is not. Before the original story, \"A Rape on Campus,\" was pulled from the Rolling Stone website, it registered 2.7 million hits following its publication in November -- more than any noncelebrity story in the magazine's history. An anonymous undergraduate, given the name \"Jackie,\" told Rolling Stone writer Sabrina Rubin Erdely she had been invited to a party thrown by Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in 2012 -- only to end up beaten and gang-raped by seven boys, who were allegedly coached along in the attack by the same student, a casual acquaintance, who had invited Jackie to the party. The horrific allegations sparked protests against the fraternity,  a police investigation, the temporary suspension of all fraternities at the school and a nationwide debate about the prevalence of sexual violence on college campuses. But the story began to unravel almost immediately when Washington Post reporter T. Rees Shapiro took a closer look, leading Rolling Stone to back away from the story and request a review by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. That review, which is considerably longer than the original article, reveals startling lapses in basic journalistic practice. Rolling Stone writer Erdely never verified the identity of the attacker and therefore never confronted him with the allegations; she never spoke to three of Jackie's friends who allegedly talked with Jackie immediately after the attack, and she never gave the fraternity a fair chance to respond, refusing to provide specific information about what happened and when. And at every step of the way, when Jackie began acting flaky -- refusing to provide basic information needed to verify her story or vanishing for weeks at a time without returning calls from the reporter -- neither Erdely nor her editors or the magazine's fact checkers made the hard but necessary decision to hit the pause button and decline to run the story. Having worked part time as a journalism professor for a decade (including one semester at Columbia), I would agree with colleagues who call Rolling Stone's lapses the kind that would be unacceptable in a freshman classroom. I've told students for years: You should never print allegations without giving people a fair chance to respond. And you should never take a source's word about important facts without verifying the truth. (There's a reason we call it reporting and not dictation.) Most of all, I tell students, remember that you're writing about human beings, who are complicated creatures: The good guys are never all that good, and the bad guys usually aren't completely bad. People can be mistaken or deceitful, I tell young reporters, they frequently forget and often lie to themselves. That doesn't make a source useless, but it must make you extra careful. Unfortunately, the early word from Rolling Stone is that they've absorbed none of these lessons. Publisher Jann Wenner has apparently decided not to fire, demote or discipline anybody at Rolling Stone, provoking expressions of disbelief among seasoned journalists. \"No one fired at Rolling Stone. Really?\" wrote CNN media critic Brian Stelter. \"What would Rolling Stone in its heyday write about an institution that screwed up unbelievably, damaged people's lives, but punished no one?\" tweeted John Bresnahan, the Capitol bureau chief of Politico. \"Rolling Stone outsources its investigation to Columbia and proceeds to do nothing in terms of individual accountability afterward? OK...,\" tweeted pundit Joe Concha. Worse still, the editors who committed the blunder seem unprepared to revamp their operation to prevent a repeat of the debacle, framing the error as an earnest but misguided attempt to believe the word of a sexual assault victim. \"Rolling Stone's senior editors are unanimous in the belief that the story's failure does not require them to change their editorial systems,\" the Columbia report says. And check out this amazing conclusion from Will Dana, the managing editor who presided over the disaster. Dana told the Columbia team: \"It's not like I think we need to overhaul our process, and I don't think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things. We just have to do what we've always done and just make sure we don't make this mistake again.\" That smug attitude pretty much ensures Rolling Stone's newsroom managers will commit another goof in the future. At a minimum, they should heed the wise counsel of my friend Bill Grueskin, an executive editor at Bloomberg who formerly served as dean of academic affairs at the Columbia J-school. \"When doing big, investigative stories, reporters face many challenges: recalcitrant sources, complex numbers, buried records. Editors, whose labors are usually cloaked in anonymity, are spared most of those hurdles. But they face their own internal newsroom challenges, particularly when handling a potential blockbuster story,\" Grueskin writes. \"They must keep their star reporters happy, trim verbiage that interrupts the narrative, and deal with the expectations of bosses hungry for prizes and traffic.\" The problem could be, says Grueskin, that Rolling Stone had too many chefs in the kitchen, instead of \"a single, talented editor with an intact set of vertebrae.\" Until Wenner and his team learn that basic lesson -- and revamp their hiring, editing and fact-checking process accordingly -- the Rolling Stone fiasco will eventually be followed by another, one made less forgivable because we all saw it coming.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 107 words:\nAt first police in Marana, Arizona, thought the shoplifted gun Mario Valencia held as he walked through a busy office park was locked and unable to fire. The cable through the lever and trigger couldn't be taken off, an officer was told by an employee of the Walmart where Valencia took the gun and some rounds of ammunition. But just 10 seconds after the worker told police that ... a shot. Valencia had fired into the air, and less than a minute later a police car slammed into him in a move that ended a crime spree and sparked nationwide discussion on the officer's unusual tactic. The 36-year-old Valencia was hospitalized and within a few days transferred to jail where he faces 15 charges, including shoplifting the .30-30 rifle. That February morning, police have said, Valencia committed several crimes in nearby Tucson before stealing a car and driving to the Walmart in Marana. There he went to the sporting goods department, asked to see a rifle, then told an employee he wanted the ammunition. Officer who drove into suspect justified, chief says. The woman told police she gave Valencia the rounds because he told her he would break the case with the bullets inside. He also told her not to do anything stupid. In spite of that she also said she didn't feel threatened, leading police to charge him with shoplifting and not armed robbery. Walmart told CNN's Miguel Marquez that  the store clerk acted appropriately, even using a code to alert security to call police. Valencia took the gun and ammo and fled into a nearby business park where he encountered an officer in a slow-moving patrol car. At one point he pointed the weapon at an officer and at another he pointed it at his head. The officer told him several times to put down the gun, police have said. The officers that were tailing him assumed that he likely couldn't shoot anyone because of the store's lock. Marana police on Thursday said the cable gun lock was still on the rifle when it was recovered. But the wire that goes through the trigger and the lever to reload the gun were loose enough to allow it to still be used, police said. It also should have been wrapped through the lever twice, not once, police said. A Walmart spokesman told CNN that the rifle had been properly locked and might have been affected by the hard blow caused by the police car. Valencia, who is in Pima County Jail, will appear in court again on May 18.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "On February 107, in Marana, Arizona, Mario Valencia shoplifted a .30-30 rifle and ammunition from a Walmart. Employees believed the gun was locked and unable to fire due to a cable through the lever and trigger. However, 107 seconds later, Valencia fired the gun into the air, prompting a police response. An officer in a slow-moving patrol car rammed Valencia's car, ending the crime spree. Valencia faces 107 charges, including shoplifting, armed robbery, and aggravated assault. The officer's use of force was justified, according to the police chief. Valencia had committed several crimes in Tucson before stealing a car and going to the Walmart. The store clerk acted appropriately by alerting security and calling the police. The rifle was properly locked, but the cable was not wrapped around the lever twice, allowing it to be fired. Valencia will appear in court again on May 107, 107 107 107 107 107 107 107 107 107 107 107 107 107 107 107 107 107 107 107 1",

Warnock was driving through a canyon in Lewiston, Idaho, on Wednesday when he saw the tree, then looked up to see an SUV dangling over the edge of a cliff. The only thing holding the GMC Yukon and its terrified driver from a 30-foot drop was a crumpled chain-link fence, still clinging to the earth above Bryden Canyon Road. \"I seen that guy hanging there and he was trying to beat the window out or the door open and I was like 'Oh man,' 'cause only like five links were hanging there,\" Warnock told KXLY, a CNN affiliate. \"I was like, I gotta do something and no one was doing anything.\" What Warnock did next, captured in a dramatic photo by Lewiston Tribune photographer Barry Kough, made headlines around the world. Warnock dashed from his car and scrambled up a hill to the Yukon and its driver, 23-year-old Matthew Sitko, who appeared to be in shock. \"I got up there and I was like, 'Are you alright man?' He shook his head, yeah. I grabbed my Snap-on multi-tool and it had jagged edges on each end. I hit the window three times and it didn't break. Every time I hit it, the thing rocked like it was going to fall off,\" Warnock told KXLY. Sitko was finally able to get the passenger-side window down. Warnock then reached in and pulled Sitko out to safety -- a moment recorded by Kough's camera. Then Warnock disappeared. \"I left and got out of there before anyone knew who I was,\" he said. He remained an unknown good Samaritan, his identity a mystery, until Kough's picture of the daring rescue appeared in the Lewiston paper and spread across the Internet. \"I don't feel like I deserve any credit or anything,\" Warnock said. \"I just did what anyone would do, went right back to work.\" Thanks to Warnock, Sitko went to the hospital with just minor injuries. \"The Lewiston Police Department would like to thank Jason Warnock for his quick and decisive actions in helping Mr. Sitko and preventing the situation from worsening,\" said Roger Lanier, the interim police chief. Warnock told KXLY he didn't want or expect all the attention and would rather be fishing in the mountains than reading about himself.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 167 words:\nMoscow (CNN)Joy Womack is taking part in her first ballet class of the day at the Kremlin Ballet Theatre, kicking her legs up to her head, jumping and spinning across the room. After class, she eats boiled sweets, one after another -- they are a cheap form of energy. The dancer, raised in California and Texas, left her parents and eight brothers and sisters behind when she arrived in Russia six years ago, aged 15, speaking no Russian. She studied at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy and was one of the first Americans accepted from the school into the company. But in 2013 she left under a cloud -- media reports suggested she had claimed she was asked by an unnamed Boshoi official to pay $10,000 to dance in even small roles. The Bolshoi still stands by comments made at the time by its general director, Vladimir Urin. He asked the dancer to make an official complaint and defend her position legally, saying the theatre was ready to assist the law enforcement agencies to investigate the case and that \"if the facts are legally established, those responsible should be punished accordingly.\" The dancer did not pursue a case against the Bolshoi. When she left the Bolshoi in 2013, Womack joined the Kremlin Ballet Theatre where she still works, aged 20, as a principal ballerina; dancing close to the Russian president's office, next to the cathedrals inside the red walls of the Kremlin. The surroundings may be opulent but her pay packet is not: for her role as a principal dancer Womack says she is paid around $240 a month -- which works out at around $8 a day. The dancer says the amount of money she makes in dollars each month has fallen as the Russian ruble has weakened -- the currency has suffered, in part, from a low oil price and international sanctions imposed on Russia over its annexation of Crimea last year. Womack says a friend helps her with accommodation and she says she has to make the money stretch in order to buy food. \"For anyone paid a salary in rubles, especially since the crisis, it is extremely difficult. You have to decide what is worth more for you - experience or financial stability. I'm at a point in my life where experience is worth more.\" Sitting in the wings of the stage, chatting in Russian to the other dancers and stretching before her rehearsal for Swan Lake, she says she has to make the $185 in her bank account last for the next few weeks. To earn extra money she dances bigger roles or takes part in events abroad. The Kremlin Ballet Theatre says Womack's salary corresponds to her job title as a principal dancer and that, \"on average, the salary [principal] dancers are paid is significantly higher\" than $240 a month but that Womack could have been paid that equivalent in dollars \"depending on the exchange rate on the day and depending on how much she danced in productions the previous month.\" As an American, Womack says she is paid the same as her contemporaries and is treated just like the Russians. But she says that is not always the case offstage. \"It's extremely difficult to watch the deteriorating relationships between the United States and Russia. The great thing about working for a Russian company is that we are focused on creating art but...outside the ballet world it is difficult for foreigners; the general tendency tends to be more nationalistic and they unfortunately judge foreigners by their cover.\" Although relations between the U.S. and Russia have taken a nosedive since Russia's annexation of Crimea last March, Womack says she is \"very loyal\" to the Kremlin Ballet Theatre. \"I love the Russian system and I'm very patriotic in that sense,\" she says. And despite the political situation -- and the money -- she says, \"Russia has a lot to offer, it is a beautiful place that creates stars and that itself is worth investing one's career in.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "Joy Womack, a 15-year-old American ballet dancer, moved to Russia six years ago to study at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy. In 2013, she left the Bolshoi under controversial circumstances, with media reports suggesting she was asked to pay $10,000 to dance in small roles. The Bolshoi denied the allegations and urged Womack to file a complaint. She did not pursue legal action and joined the Kremlin Ballet Theatre instead, where she now works as a principal ballerina. Womack earns approximately $240 a month, a figure that has decreased due to the weakening Russian ruble. She relies on a friend for housing and stretches her income to buy food. Womack says she is treated equally as an American but faces challenges offstage due to deteriorating U.S.-Russia relations. She remains loyal to the Kremlin Ballet Theatre and values the artistic opportunities it provides.",

Chancey Allen Luna was found guilty of first-degree murder Friday for his role in the August 2013 drive-by shooting of Christopher Lane, a 23-year-old college student in Duncan, about 80 miles south of Oklahoma City. Luna was 16 at the time of the shooting. Lane, an Australian attending East Central University, was jogging when he was shot in the back by a gun fired by Luna. A jury recommended Friday that Luna spend life in prison without the possibility of parole, according to court records. Because he was under 18 when the crime was committed, he is not eligible for the death penalty. He'll be formally sentenced in June. The vehicle's driver, Michael Jones, pleaded guilty in March to second-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison. Jones, who was 17 at the time of the murder, will be eligible for parole starting in 2051, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. Prosecutors dropped first-degree murder charges filed against the third suspect, then only 15, after he agreed to testify against Luna and Jones, according to CNN affiliate KSWO. He will now be tried as a juvenile with accessory to murder after the fact. Duncan police Chief Danny Ford told Australian radio station 3AW that when police arrested the teens, Jones offered a motive that made clear that Lane, a baseball player on scholarship, was chosen at random. \"We were bored and didn't have anything to do, so we decided to kill somebody.\" After the verdict, Luna appeared to be crying as deputies led him out of the courtroom in handcuffs, whimpering  \"I'm sorry\"  to a reporter.

There's the traditional, time-tested way, where new doctors graduate from medical school and then pass a series of national exams while training for years as resident physicians. Then there's the approach being forged in Florida and Arizona: getting elected to a state legislature. Lawmakers in those states are too often donning the white coats to orchestrate medical practice. In 2011, Florida enacted the Firearm Owners' Privacy Act, which threatens prosecution and loss of licensure for any physicians who dare ask their patients about gun ownership and gun safety.  Guns are a scientifically uncontested health risk. Asking about them is standard practice in pediatrics and psychiatry. I treat brain injuries, and it's part of my job to talk with patients about things that might be unsafe for them, like driving. And handling weapons. Some of those I treat suffered their injuries by bullets, typically fired by family members or themselves. Does anyone really believe I shouldn't talk about gun safety in these cases? It's a good thing I don't practice in Florida. Florida's gun censorship law was dragged into court soon after the governor signed it, and while a three-judge appeals panel upheld the law last summer, doctors can still ask about guns while the full 11th Circuit Court of Appeals decides whether it will take up the case, a decision that could come down any day, the president of the Florida chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Dr. Tommy Schechtman, told me. He is a plaintiff in the case. In Arizona, another assault on physician free speech is scheduled to go into effect this summer. Bill 1318 goes a step beyond silencing doctors. It requires them to lie. The bill was originally a hum-drum attempt to block health plans from covering abortion services, a common state and federal strategy. But legislators slid in a last-minute provision mandating that physicians who prescribe the abortion pill RU-486 tell patients the pill is reversible. That's the opinion of a particular San Diego doctor who says this can be done through risky, large doses of progesterone. But the doctor hasn't proven his case, and his regimen is not recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or the Food and Drug Administration. Any doctor is certainly within his or her rights to review the limited information available about the San Diego regimen and decide whether to discuss it with patients, but actually requiring physicians to make claims most believe to be untrue and unsafe means the legislators are overstepping their bounds and interfering with the patient-doctor relationship. I cannot imagine anyone attempting to put words into the mouth of a lawyer privately consulting with a client. Why are physicians putting up with a professional assault the American Bar Association would never permit? Dr. Ilana Addis, chairwoman of the Arizona chapter of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told me the amendment was added shortly before she was scheduled to testify about the bill before the Arizona House. While Planned Parenthood and the ACLU joined her organization in criticizing the provision, the bill passed both chambers and was recently signed by the governor. There's a common relationship shared by these laws, beyond turning doctors into government spokespeople. These laws capitalize on controversial issues to divide and conquer. Physicians don't all share the same opinions on abortion and guns any more than they all vote Republican or Democrat. This is part of the reason the key state physicians' associations aren't taking the lead in battling these laws. The battle is left to the specialties most affected. In Florida, that's the state's chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, since pediatricians are most likely to ask about guns in the home. In Arizona, it's the state chapter of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists carrying the torch for physician free speech. The Florida Medical Association didn't provide me with details about whether it has a lobbying effort against the gun law, and the Arizona Medical Association told me in a statement that \"ArMA's policy is to take no position on abortion.\" Representing physicians as a whole, the state medical associations have the most political clout in statehouses. The Massachusetts Medical Society (MSS) tried to utilize that power recently when it decided to dedicate \"Doctor's Day\" to the issue of physician free speech, highlighting the threat posed by Florida's gun law in particular. Members are concerned about the precedent being set. Arkansas enacted a law similar to Arizona just days later. The American Medical Association can do more. It did file a friend-of-the-court brief as part of the Florida legal challenge, but at this writing hasn't weighed in on Arizona. The AMA didn't sign on to a statement released last  week by the Coalition to Protect the Patient-Provider Relationship that hits hard on the new abortion laws as an affront to good medical care.  Its huge lobbying operations are tied up in Washington, while states are the main battleground over the integrity of medical practice. Now that the AMA has won the age-old \"doc fix\" battle, ending automatic Medicare payment cuts to doctors, perhaps it will consider assigning some of its $18 million lobbying team to stand in for lackluster state affiliates who've abdicated their responsibility to vigorously defend the medical profession. We have a Surgeon General now, Vivek Murthy, and he is on a national listening tour while he prepares to announce his areas of policy focus on April 22, Jonathan Beeton, a Health and Human Services spokesman told me. I hope Murthy will see beyond the bluster of abortion and gun politics and zero in on a key issue affecting public health -- free and unfettered communication between patients and doctors.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "The traditional path to practicing medicine in America involves graduating from medical school, passing national exams, and training as resident physicians. However, in Florida and Arizona, there's a new approach: getting elected to a state legislature. Florida's Firearm Owners' Privacy Act threatens prosecution and loss of licensure for physicians who ask about gun ownership and safety, while Arizona's Bill 1138 requires doctors to lie about the reversibility of the abortion pill RU-486. These laws infringe on physician free speech and interfere with the patient-doctor relationship. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are leading the fight against these laws, as they most affect their specialties. The American Medical Association, with its significant lobbying power, could do more to support these efforts. The new Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, is currently on a listening tour and may address this issue in his policy focus announcement on April 22, 200 words.",

Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the second remote-controlled robot last week after the first one broke down. The robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected, an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively, according to a statement released by TEPCO. \"It is a great step forward towards the decommissioning work as we can earn necessary data for the next investigation,\" said Akira Ono, the chief of Fukushima Daiichi plant. TEPCO said the yellow seen on the images seemed to suggest a discoloration of the grating, though the cause was unknown. It said the green glow could not be seen when filmed from other angles. The shape-shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. TEPCO says the site's still too dangerous for workers to enter. The first robot, which was sent in on April 10, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO.  A report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded. TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on April 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations, completing around two-thirds of the originally planned route. The second robot was sent in on April 15 and collected data from all 11 points, as scheduled. Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter. Decommissioning work is estimated to cost $50 billion and will take years to complete. TEPCO called the robotic probe an \"unprecedented\" experiment.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nOn October 31, 2014, the Italian government announced the end of \"Mare Nostrum\" -- a naval mission that rescued would-be migrants in peril as they tried to cross the Mediterranean to seek security and a new life in Europe. In the operation's year-long existence, the Italian Navy and Coastguard had rescued an estimated 100,000 people. But it proved expensive and politically contentious, and Europe was not prepared to help Italy shoulder the burden of the crisis. Without European support, the Italian government cut back the naval assets dedicated to rescuing migrants. Mare Nostrum, which had been launched after some 600 people died when two migrant ships sank in 2013, was replaced by the more modest \"Operation Triton,\" under the auspices of the European Union's border agency, Frontex. Triton has about one-third of the funding of Mare Nostrum, with just six ships and patrol boats, two planes and one helicopter. It was designed as a policing rather than a humanitarian mission. At its inception, Klaus Rosler, operations director for Frontex, said \"Triton is not a replacement for Mare Nostrum.\" Nor was Frontex \"a coordinating body for search and rescue operations.\" Six months later, the argument about how to handle unprecedented numbers of desperate people heading for Europe continues unabated. Contributors to Triton include Portugal, the Netherlands, Finland and Iceland. Britain -- for example -- is not. It argues that search and rescue operations in international waters are \"an unintended 'pull factor,' encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths.\" It's perhaps no coincidence that immigration is a hot-button issue in Britain, with the UK Independence Party attacking the Conservative-led coalition government for being soft on allowing foreigners into the country. Similarly, the opposition Northern League in Italy opposed Mare Nostrum, accusing it of enticing migrants. If the first few months of this year are any guide, demand has not diminished even if the prospect of being rescued has. People from Syria, Mali and Eritrea are among the tens of thousands trying to escape repression, violence and abject poverty. Despite the danger, the great majority head first for Libya, where the collapse of authority allows smuggling operations to go unhindered. Italy -- the European state whose territory is closest to Libya -- has borne the brunt of the task of picking up, sheltering and providing food and medical help to the illegal migrants. In 2014, 170,000 migrants arrived in Italy by sea. Italian ships have picked up about 11,000 migrants in the past week alone. The islands of Sicily and of Lampedusa (which is closer to Tunisia than to mainland Italy) see an almost daily influx of human misery. And at this time of year, there is a surge in the illegal trafficking as the weather and sea conditions improve. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has said the Mediterranean is a sea, not a cemetery. On Sunday, in the wake of the latest disaster, he complained that Italy had been coping with the crisis in \"near solitude, sometimes assisted by some other international presence.\" Italy has also led calls for an international peacekeeping issue to help restore stability in Libya, not least in an effort to tackle the flow of migrants, many of whom set out from around Misrata and other ports in the west of the country. According to some human rights groups, the danger to migrants on the high seas has been accentuated by merchant ships turning a blind eye to boats in distress -- despite a maritime obligation to come to the aid of vessels in peril. After the latest sinking, the European Commission called an urgent meeting of foreign and interior ministers, saying that \"the reality is stark and our actions must therefore be bold. These are human lives at stake, and the European Union as a whole has a moral and humanitarian obligation to act.\" EU Foreign Policy chief Federica Mogherini, who is Italian, said Sunday: \"We need to save human lives all together, as all together we need to protect our borders and to fight the trafficking of human beings.\"  The task could not be \"left only to the southern countries,\" she insisted. But bold action is rarely a hallmark of the EU. The recently installed head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Junker, has set out his priorities -- but they are yet to be acted upon. Junker said the current budget of Frontex - some 90 million euros ($97 million) - was \"a good start but does not yet equal the task of protecting Europe's common borders.\" That money has to cover all Frontex's roles -- and it's not only the Italian coast that is being targeted by migrants. Further east, thousands of migrants are trying to reach Greece by land and sea. According to the UN's refugee agency, 219,000 refugees and migrants crossed the Mediterranean last year. Junker has also argued for greater assistance to the European Asylum Support Office, which is based in Malta, arguing for \"more thorough risk assessments to spot problem areas before they become overloaded.\" Most controversially, Junker is proposing Europe adopt a common asylum system, saying that \"one and the same applicant for asylum can have a 70-75% chance of being granted asylum in one country of the European Union and less than 1%, with the same reasons, in another country.\" But progress toward a Europe-wide approach on migration is painfully slow. The European Commission plans to publish a policy document next month, but member states are in no hurry to grapple with such a politically explosive and costly subject. In the meantime, the argument in European meetings is likely to focus on priorities, with some (the UK and Germany) likely to argue that more resources must be devoted to cracking down on the lucrative people-smuggling racket. \"We must target the traffickers who are responsible for so many people dying at sea and prevent their innocent victims from being tricked or forced into making these perilous journeys,\" said British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond Sunday. Others, including Italy, Greece, Spain and France, are expected to seek more concerted action in handling and funding the influx. But the hundreds of migrants being herded onto barely seaworthy boats from Libyan beaches will be oblivious to the debate.

    "answer": "On October 31, 2014, the Italian government ended \"Mare Nostrum,\" a naval mission that rescued approximately 100,000 would-be migrants in the Mediterranean Sea during its year-long existence. The Italian Navy and Coastguard operation was expensive and politically contentious, with Europe unwilling to help Italy manage the migrant crisis. In its place, the European Union's border agency, Frontex, launched \"Operation Triton,\" which had one-third of Mare Nostrum's funding and fewer resources for search and rescue operations. Triton was designed as a policing mission rather than a humanitarian one. The debate on how to handle the unprecedented number of migrants seeking security and a new life in Europe continues. In 2014, 170,000 migrants arrived in Italy by sea, and in the past week alone, Italian ships picked up about 11,000 migrants. Italy, the European state closest to Libya, has borne the brunt of the task of providing shelter, food, and medical help to the illegal migrants. The European Commission called for an urgent meeting of foreign and interior ministers to address the crisis, acknowledging the moral and humanitarian obligation to act. However, bold action is not a hallmark of the EU, and progress toward a Europe-wide approach on",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 123 words:\nAn American teenager who helped her boyfriend stuff her mother's lifeless body into a suitcase at an upmarket hotel in Bali has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. Heather Mack, 19, who gave birth to her own daughter just weeks ago, was found guilty with her 21-year-old boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack on the Indonesian island last August. Schaefer was sentenced to 18 years in prison for battering von Wiese-Mack to death in room 317 of the St. Regis Bali Resort. Schaefer had claimed he killed his girlfriend's mother in self-defense after a violent argument erupted over the young couple's relationship. The beaten body of von Wiese-Mack was found in a large silver suitcase that the couple had loaded in a waiting taxi outside the resort.  They told the driver they'd be back soon, but after a lengthy wait he alerted hotel staff who inspected the bag, noticed blood and called police. The lovers were arrested after being found the following morning at another hotel about 15 kilometers (nine miles) away. Inside the bag, von Wiese-Mack's body had been wrapped in hotel bedding. A forensic examination determined that she had died from a blunt force to the face that fractured her facial bones and caused her to suffocate. Described as a Chicago socialite, von Wiese-Mack was reported to have a troubled relationship with her teenage daughter. Schaefer denied that the murder was premeditated. He told the court that he acted in self-defense when his girlfriend's mother started strangling him during an argument in the Bali hotel room. \"She squeezed my neck for about 20 to 30 seconds. I couldn't breathe. I had blood going to my head and my eyes were so watery,\" Schaefer told the court. He said he reached for a nearby bowl \"before she could.\"  \"I couldn't see for a moment because my eyes were so watery and I was distraught, I was in a state of mind, I had no idea what was happening. I was almost about to black out. And I grabbed it and I started swinging,\" he told the court. Mack told the court her mother had threatened to kill the couple's unborn baby, according to local media. The prosecutor alleged that the two planned the murder, because Mack's mother disapproved of their relationship. After being detained by police, the couple initially claimed they'd been taken captive at the resort by an armed gang, whose members killed Heather's mother, and from whom they managed to escape. The two were tried separately, though both trials were heard by the same court, with the same prosecutors. Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 18 years for Schaefer and 15 years for Mack. Under Indonesian law, Mack will be allowed to keep her baby with her in prison for two years, after which she can nominate who should take custody. Journalists Fairuz Husaini and Ragil Lestari and CNN's Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nBoston (CNN)Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's bombs tore through their bodies: singeing flesh, shattering bones, shredding muscles and severing limbs. But on Tuesday, jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead. Now that he has been found guilty on every count, the jury must decide whether Boston Marathon bomber Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. This is the victim impact part of the case, and the testimony was heartbreaking. Four young people are gone, and grief fills the spaces they once occupied. A father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called \"Princess.\" \"Krystle was the light of my life. She was extremely smart, hardworking, beautiful, every father's dream. I miss her a lot,\" said William A. Campbell Sr., dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter, a 29-year-old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 Boston Marathon. She was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations, he said. \"Nobody fills that boot now.\" Others are expected to come and cry for Lingzi Lu, \"a jolly soul,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said, quoting the slain Chinese grad student's father. More tears will be shed for Martin Richard, who was 8 and looked just like his dad. And for Sean Collier, who was remembered at his memorial service by these words: \"Big heart, big smiles, big service. All love.\" \"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain, they had time to be scared and frightened, but they had no time to say good-bye,\" Pellegrini told the jury. \"And that is the very essence of terror.\" Timeline of bombings, manhunt and aftermath. To understand the toll Tsarnaev's bombs took, jurors must know the stories of his victims, the prosecutor said. \"These young women, this young man and this little boy, all of them were loved and they loved in return,\" Pellegrini said. \"Before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable, they were sons, they were daughters, they were grandchildren, they were brothers and they were sisters.\" Jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling, happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings. There was the photo of Campbell as a little girl in a red tap-dancing outfit. And then came the one that made her father smile through his tears. She was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform. \"She traded that in for a bat,\" Campbell said. \"She wasn't really a girly girl, but she loved to whitewater, camp, play baseball. She had a good arm on her. I was very proud of her.\" By contrast, jurors also were left with an indelible image of Tsarnaev, taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held. It is dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs at the Boston Marathon. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a profane salute. \"This is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged,\" Pellegrini said. \"Without remorse, he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused.\" Tsarnaev saw the people he killed as \"the enemy,\" she said. As a result, two women and a man never reached the age of 30, and a little boy never made it to the third grade. \"He knew they were innocents. He even called them that,\" Pellegrini added, referring to the message Tsarnaev scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings. \"But it didn't stop him from murdering them.\" The people who were maimed by Tsarnaev's bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks. The stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of Tsarnaev's trial. When the first of the two bombs went off, Gillian Reny, a senior in high school, was standing near the woman she came to know was  Krystle Campbell. \"There was a complete, utter chilling silence and then chaos. Chaos like I'd never seen and never hope to see again,\" she said. The force of the blast knocked her to the ground. When she looked around, she saw blood and muscle everywhere. Her shin bone had snapped and was protruding. \"Muscle was everywhere. It was the most horrifying image I could imagine. Just seeing that on my own body,\" she said, and began to cry. \"I remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere, blood everywhere.\" Were you bleeding? she was asked. \"Yes, enormously. Looking down at the blood I was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone,\" she said. \"I was terrified that I was going to die. I did not know that I could be that injured and survive.\" She said she began to scream. Her bone-chilling cries could be heard on a video played in court -- the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown. Doctors were able to save Reny's leg, but others weren't so lucky. Celeste Corcoran lost both legs, one below the knee and the other above the knee. An amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from, jurors have learned at this trial. Corcoran was at the finish line, waiting for her sister to cross. \"And then our whole world just exploded,\" she said. \"I unfortunately remember every single detail.\" She remembers being knocked to the ground, hearing nothing and then screams, and seeing blood everywhere. \"It's kind of hard to explain but I want to get it right for all of you to understand,\" she told the jury. She said it was \"a surreal, out-of-body experience.\"  She remembers thinking, \"What was that?\" and wishing she could turn back time by five minutes. Her husband bent over her and told her it was a terrorist attack. By then, she began to feel pain worse than anything she had imagined. She wondered if she would die. \"It hurt too much. I just didn't care,\" she said. \"I remember thinking I was going to die, that no one could go through that much pain.  I knew it was very bad and I was thinking, 'Is this it? Am I going to die?' I remember thinking I wanted to die. The pain was too much. I wanted to die.\" And then, she said, \"the mom in me\" took over. She remembers telling herself: \" 'Hell no, I don't want to die. I have too much living to do. Don't let this be the end. This can't be the end.'\" She remembers feeling relief once she arrived at the hospital, even as she signed the form authorizing doctors to take both her legs. \"Can I get on with my life? Absolutely,\" she said. But she can never forget she's a double amputee. \"There's always a level of discomfort. Right now I'm not comfortable,\" she said from the witness stand. \"The bottoms of my limbs, there's this constant numb burning sensation. The only way I can describe it is it's like you have the worst athlete's foot in my life.\" Sometimes, she feels a stabbing sensation where her toes and calves used to be. \"You don't realize until you're a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are,\" she said. \"Inclines are very hard.\" Daily life is literally an uphill battle.

Soon after the trailer went up late on Friday, YouTuber Bobby Burns got to work on doing his own version using classic superhero footage. Instead of Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill facing off, this version wonders what it would be like if comics' classic characters Adam West and Christopher Reeve took their places. CNN spoke to 18-year-old Burns about what motivated him to make his now-viral video. (Warner Bros. Pictures, the studio behind \"Batman v. Superman,\" is owned by Time Warner, as is CNN.) CNN: When did you start making YouTube videos like this? Burns: At age 11. I work for the Made In Network in Nashville, Tennessee. CNN: Where did this idea come from? Burns: I'm pretty hyped for \"Batman v. Superman.\" As soon as I saw the trailer, my brain immediately went to the classic \"Batman\" [TV series] and I thought how funny it would be if this film was made at the time. CNN: What were you looking to accomplish? Burns: I wanted to contrast the old with the new. CNN: What kind of reaction have you received? Burns: Within an hour of the trailer going up, I went to work on the edit. Within four hours, my edit was finished and up on the Internet. The reaction has been great! It's awesome to see so many people enjoying what I made. Take a look at the fan trailer below:.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\n(Billboard)Considering the Academy of Country Music Awards celebrated its 50th anniversary on Sunday night at the Dallas Cowboys stadium, it was bound to be bigger than any previous year's ACMs. Plus, as hosts Blake Shelton and Luke Bryan were quick to point out, everything is bigger in Texas. Billboard: 2015 ACM Awards: See All the Photos. But bigger isn't always better. Here's our breakdown of the 10 best and 5 worst moments at the 2015 ACMs. The Best. Eric Church & Keith Urban provide an opening wallop. With a full stadium and millions of home viewers watching, two of country's leading men successfully lit the fuse for the 50th annual ACM Awards with a slick joint kickoff performance. Eric Church's \"Pledge Allegiance To The Hag\" was a fine throwback, but Keith Urban's powerhouse \"Raise 'Em Up\" lived up to its title -- and then some. Setting a Guinness World Record. Not only was this the ACMs biggest audience ever, but the 2015 ACM Awards brought in the biggest audience for a live TV awards show ever. Now that's how you celebrate half a century. Reba McEntire demonstrates how it's done. During a night that found a couple performers sounding a little weak in the vocal department, Reba McEntire showed the entire Cowboys stadium -- and many younger singers who don't have half her energy -- how it's done. Reba is eternal. Taylor Swift singing in the audience. Whether it was during Eric Church or Martina McBride, T-Swift was heating up the audience by singing and swaying along to country staples. Taylor might have gone pop for \"1989,\" but she was deep in the heart of Texas for this annual country extravaganza. Billboard: 2015 ACM Awards: And the Winners Are... Garth Brooks' All-American salute. During Brooks' performance of \"All-American Kid,\" the country giant welcomed a slew of U.S. military representatives into AT&T Stadium, in an emotional moment that put the red, white and blue front and center. Brooks ended the performance by saluting the U.S. armed forces \"who are here and are all around the world for protecting our freedom,\" and also shouted out his home state of Oklahoma, who are grieving 20 years after the Oklahoma City bombing on Sunday. A truly classy moment from one of the best ever. Taylor Swift's mom makes an appearance. Sure, Andrea Swift's presentation of a special award for her daughter came with a fun origin tale about the creation of \"Love Story\" and some lovely words about the 25-year-old superstar. But the sight of the elder Swift -- just days after Taylor confirmed that her mother had been diagnosed with cancer -- walking to the podium was more than enough to yield one of the night's most poignant moments. Christina Aguilera joins Rascal Flatts. Aguilera is far from country, but with a voice as malleable as hers, she can pass for a song or two. After singing a bit of the tune she did while guesting on Nashville, Xtina joined longtime hitmakers Rascal Flatts for \"Riot\" from their recent album \"Rewind.\" Aguilera and Gary LeVox trading vocals was the rare unexpected artist pairing that actually worked. Miranda Lambert domination. In addition to kicking ass during her \"Mama's Broken Heart\"/\"Little Red Wagon\" medley, Lambert justly owned the night when it came to awards. If there's one thing the country community loves more than Miranda Lambert, it's giving Miranda Lambert awards. Billboard: Watch Little Big Town Bring Provocative 'Girl Crush' to ACMs. Little Big Town don't back down. Despite some mild controversy over their song \"Girl Crush,\" Little Big Town brought the poignant ballad to the awards show, giving the ACMs one of its more melancholy moments. Jason Aldean comes on strong. For a night featuring some shaky vocals, Aldean brought his silky yet powerful country croon to the ACMs during a massive medley. It's hard to see an audience get weak in the knees when you're watching at home, but it's fair to assume that's what happened during his performance. The Worst. Tony Romo. The Dallas Cowboys QB was understandably a little stiff on the mic (athletes usually aren't the most charismatic public speakers) but the whole gag with Shelton asking Romo to toss Bryan a pass went on waaaaay too long. On the plus side, Bryan caught the pass. On the other hand, there was a tired play on words about balls. The length. Three hours for the 50th ACMs? Sure, why not. Three and a half hours? That's pushing it. They could have shaved off the last half hour by cutting a couple of the performers who only sang half a song, and shortened a few of the massive commercial breaks. All of the Milestone Awards. Taylor Swift was given an extended honor at this year's ACM Awards, but some of the Milestone Awards -- especially those given to Reba McEntire, Kenny Chesney and George Strait -- seemed rushed for the country giants they were saluting. It's understandable since 2015 is the 50th anniversary of the ACMs, but sometimes, less (recipients) is more. Steven Tyler's facial hair. See link. Twitter calling out Taylor Swift. Plenty of country fans went after T-Swizzle on Twitter, berating her for attending the ACMs after \"abandoning\" country music for pop. The truth is, Swift has just as many country classics under her belt as any other artist in her age range. She might have moved to pop, but don't underplay her importance to the genre that birthed her. ©2015 Billboard. All Rights Reserved.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "The 2015 Academy of Country Music Awards celebrated its 50th anniversary with a bigger-than-ever event at the Dallas Cowboys stadium. The night was filled with memorable moments, both good and bad. Some highlights included Eric Church and Keith Urban's electrifying opening performance, Reba McEntire's energetic rendition of her hits, and Garth Brooks' emotional tribute to the U.S. military and Oklahoma. Taylor Swift's mother made a poignant appearance, and Christina Aguilera's unexpected collaboration with Rascal Flatts was a standout. Miranda Lambert dominated the awards, taking home multiple statuettes. However, the show had its low points, such as Tony Romo's lengthy introduction and some drawn-out Milestone Awards. Steven Tyler's facial hair and criticism of Taylor Swift on social media also caused a stir. Overall, the 2015 ACM Awards were a mix of triumphs and missteps, but the country community came together to celebrate 50 years of music.",

With just weeks until his box-office victory lap for \"Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" Joss Whedon is now facing a lawsuit accusing him of stealing the idea for the 2012 meta-horror movie The Cabin in the Woods. Whedon produced and co-wrote the script for Cabin with director Drew Goddard, a writer on Whedon's \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and a fanboy favorite in his own right, with credits that include Netflix's \"Daredevil\" (and reportedly may soon include Sony's upcoming Spider-Man projects). Whedon and Goddard are named as defendants, along with Lionsgate and Whedon's Mutant Enemy production company, in the complaint filed Monday in California federal court. Joss Whedon Slams 'Jurassic World' Clip as \"'70s-Era Sexist\" In the complaint, Peter Gallagher (no, not that Peter Gallagher) claims Whedon and Goddard took the idea for \"The Cabin in the Woods\" from his 2006 novel \"The Little White Trip: A Night In the Pines.\" He's suing for copyright infringement and wants $10 million in damages. Gallagher is basing his claim on the works' similar premises: Both feature a group of young people terrorized by monsters while staying at a cabin in what is revealed to be (spoiler alert) a horror-film scenario designed by mysterious operators. Read the full complaint. Gallagher also alleges similarities between the characters' names and personalities -- his book's blond Julie and shy Dura and the film's Jules (Anna Hutchison) and Dana (Kristen Connolly), and handsome and scatterbrained men in both works -- and certain scenes involving the characters finding strange items in their respective cabins and discovering hidden cameras. 'Age of Ultron': Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch Are \"Massively Important,\" Says Joss Whedon (Video) In the complaint, Gallagher describes how he self-published the novel and \"began grassroots efforts\" to sell it on the Venice Beach boardwalk and on Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade. \"[The defendants] currently reside and operate out of Santa Monica, California, a short distance from where the Book was sold,\" the lawsuit claims. Gallagher alleges that he \"was contacted by multiple credited entertainment industry producers who expressed interest in the Book,\" but he doesn't specify Lionsgate or Mutant Enemy.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 199 words:\nSaudi Arabia has executed a second Indonesian maid despite protests from Jakarta, which is itself facing fierce criticism for its failure to heed calls for clemency for a number of foreigners on death row. The Indonesian government summoned the Saudi ambassador to the foreign ministry on Thursday after learning that 37-year-old Karni Bt. Medi Tarsim had been beheaded, without official warning. Karni was sentenced to death in March 2013 for killing her employer's four-year-old child. She was the second Indonesian domestic worker executed by the Saudis this week, following the death of Siti Zaenab Bt. Duhri Rupa on Tuesday -- the execution again carried out with Indonesian officials receiving no prior warning. \"That is our main issue. It's not that suddenly there was an execution. We didn't know when it would take place. Still, we took over a hundred steps to try to free (Siti) from execution,\" said Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesman for Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Siti, 47, was convicted of killing her employer's wife in 1999, but the death penalty was delayed until the youngest of the victim's sons reached puberty and was old enough to consider requesting her pardon. He didn't. Rights groups say they suspect Siti was mentally ill and cast aspersions on claims she had confessed to the crime. Amnesty International also said reports suggested she had been abused while working in the victim's home. \"Imposing the death penalty and executing someone with a suspected mental illness smacks of a basic lack of humanity,\" said Philip Luther, Middle East and North Africa Programme Director at Amnesty International. In a statement, the Indonesian government said the protection of its citizens abroad was a \"priority\" and listed the attempts it had made to help Siti, including providing legal aid, writing letters to the Saudi King and \"continuous efforts... to ask for forgiveness from the family.\" Indonesia said in many cases its efforts had worked. From July 2011 to the end of March this year, it said it had \"successfully freed\" 238 of its citizens from the death penalty. One of those was Satinah Binti Jumadi Ahmad who was sentenced to death in 2011 after reportedly admitting to killing her 70-year-old employer and stealing $10,000. Satinah claimed she acted in self-dense. Days before her scheduled execution, the Indonesian government stepped in with so-called \"blood money\" of 7 million Saudi riyals -- at the time worth about $1.8 million. Satinah was spared. Indonesia's efforts to save its own citizens does not sit well with advocates who are seeking the same mercy for foreigners languishing on Indonesia's death row. Two of the most high profile cases are Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, Australians convicted of attempting to smuggle heroin from Bali to Australia in 2005. Friday marks the 10-year anniversary of their arrest with seven other people -- members of the so-called \"Bali Nine\" -- who are currently serving lengthy sentences in Indonesian prisons. As the alleged ringleaders, Chan and Sukumaran were sentenced to death, and denied clemency from President Jokowi Widodo, a decision being challenged through the country's Constitutional Court. \"If Indonesia wants to effectively protect Indonesians from the death penalty abroad, Indonesia should also abolish the death penalty here,\" said Todung Mulya Lubis, one of the men's lawyers. Chan, 31, and Sukumaran -- who also turns 34 on Friday -- are currently incarcerated on Nusakambangan Island in preparation for their execution but no date has been set. Human Rights Watch called on Widodo to suspend all planned executions in Indonesia -- as the previous government did between 2008 and 2013.  No executions were carried out in 2014, but earlier this year, six people -- including five foreigners -- faced the firing squad. \"The executions of two Indonesian citizens in Saudi Arabia in a single week should be a turning point on the subject of death penalty in Indonesia,\" said Andreas Harsono, the Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch. \"Please stop the lecture of sovereignty. It is so old fashioned.\" Before news of the second execution emerged on Thursday,  the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a press briefing to denounce the Saudi action. When asked whether Jakarta's complaints smacked of hypocrisy, given the country's refusal to spare foreigners on death row, spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir said: \"If you read our constitution, it is the job, the role of the government to protect its citizens, right? So it's not a double standard.\" \"On the issue of death penalty, we can have a long debate whether it is against human rights or it is morally wrong or right. That's a whole other discussion, that's a whole other argument, but what we're saying now here is we are implementing our laws and we are adhering to our constitution that we have to protect our citizens abroad.\"\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "Saudi Arabia executed a 47-year-old and a 37-year-old Indonesian maid this week despite protests from Jakarta. Karni Bt. Medi Tarsim was beheaded on Thursday for killing her employer's child in 2013, while Siti Zaenab Bt. Duhri Rupa was executed on Tuesday for a crime committed in 1999. The Indonesian government summoned the Saudi ambassador and expressed concern over the lack of prior warning. Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesman for Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated that Indonesia took over a hundred steps to prevent Siti's execution. Rights groups suspect Siti was mentally ill and allege she was abused while working in the victim's home. Indonesia has successfully freed 238 citizens from the death penalty since 10011, including Satinah Binti Jumadi Ahmad in 2011, who was sentenced to death for killing her employer and stealing $10,000. The Indonesian government provided \"blood money\" to spare her life. Critics argue that Indonesia's efforts to save its citizens contradict its refusal to grant clemency to foreigners on death row, such as Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who have been denied clemency since 2",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 154 words:\nLondon (CNN)A Polish Prince has challenged populist British politician Nigel Farage to a duel  in London's Hyde Park over his immigration policy. Farage, the leader of  the UK Independence Party (UKIP), complains that Britain's membership of the European Union means it is powerless to stop a flow of foreign immigrants, many from impoverished Eastern Europe, into his \"small island\" nation. In a video posted on YouTube, Prince Jan Zylinski said he was fed up with discrimination against Poles living in Britain. \"The most idiotic example I've heard of has been Mr. Nigel Farage blaming migrants for traffic jams on the M40,\" Zylinksi said. Holding a sword that had belonged to his father -- a  World War II war hero -- the prince laid down a verbal gauntlet. \"Enough is enough, Mr. Farage. So what I'd like to do, Mr. Farage, is to challenge you to a duel,\" he said. \"I would like us to meet in Hyde Park one morning with our swords and resolve this matter in the way that an 18th century Polish aristocrat and an English gentleman would traditionally do. \"Are you up for it Mr. Farage?\" Farage -- who is on the campaign trail ahead of Britain's general elections on May 7 -- said he did not intend to cross swords with the prince. \"It is an impressive sword. I don't have one but I'm sure we could find one if we had to. But I'm not intending to accept the offer,\" a spokesman quoted him as saying. \"I would have thought that a Polish prince with a long Polish lineage would rather agree with me that it's a complete tragedy for Poland that it's lost so many of its brightest and best young people.\" UKIP wants Britain to leave the European Union. It says it would not seek to remain a party to the region's free trade or economic treaties \"while those treaties maintain a principle of free movement of labor, which prevents the UK managing its own borders.\" It has also pledged to cut the country's £9 billion ($12.4B) annual foreign aid budget. Another UKIP politician appeared to back his party leader's chances in a duel, tweeting an image of a medieval knight sliced in two, with the comment: \"This is what Nigel would do to him.\" But there was no word on whether Farage would even accept the prince's less life-threatening back-up challenge. \"Alternatively, if you don't agree or if your sword is a little bit rusty, Mr. Farage, we can meet for a different kind of duel -- a duel with words in a TV studio in the run-up to the elections,\" Zylinski suggested. \"I'm up for it, it would be really nice, hopefully you will agree.\" Zylinski posted a separate video on YouTube entitled \"7 reasons why the British should love the Poles,\" in which he pointed to a Times newspaper headline from March reading: \"We need more migrants ... they are the best workers in Britain.\" The headline, he said, applied \"principally\" to the Poles. \"What I cannot accept is the amount of hostility and in some cases hatred towards the Poles. Enough is enough, I say, this has got to stop.\" Zylinski pointed to Polish contributions to Britain including  those made by Polish RAF pilots during the Battle of Britain, what he said was a \"wonderful work ethic\" and easy integration into the community. \"We are often more loyal to Britain than many British people I know,\" he said. \"We are very grateful to be here. We would like you to be grateful too. Please stop knocking the Poles. We love this country we would like British to love us too.\"\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nWashington (CNN)Early Clinton campaign calculations, the favored way for one of her opponents to channel his concerns, a GOP ticket for the generations, and Republican calendar concerns filled our Sunday trip around the \"Inside Politics\" table. 1. Watch the volume as O'Malley uses YouTube to test Clinton pokes. Slowly but clearly, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is intensifying his criticism of overwhelming Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. How aggressive will he get? Stay tuned -- literally. CNN's Jeff Zeleny says O'Malley enjoys using YouTube videos as a quick way to spread his opinion -- and question moves by Clinton, like her reversal on the question of whether she supports allowing undocumented workers to obtain driver's licenses. \"Every time Hillary Clinton sort of adjusts her positioning from '08 to '16 -- her statement on the drivers' licenses that we discussed and other things -- Martin O'Malley has been releasing a YouTube video showing a speech where he has done something different, so watch for that to continue,\" said Zeleny. \"Those YouTube videos on his channel will be a key part of the race --the liberals love them.\" 2. The \"Obama Factor\": Clinton finds a lot to love, and some distance. Hillary Clinton is a big fan of President Obama's health care law, but not so much of a booster when it comes to his presidential leadership style. So reports AP's Lisa Lerer, who was in Iowa this past week for the Clinton campaign rollout, and who analyzes one of the most fascinating balancing acts for the onetime Obama 2008 rival who, of course, went on to serve loyally as his secretary of state. \"She embraced key portions of his legacy -- coming out strong for the health care law, for his push for immigration legislation -- but it wasn't all sunshine and light,\" said Lerer. \"She also took subtle digs at his leadership style— she said America was on the wrong track-- I can't believe I'm saying this but at times she sounded almost like a Republican.\" 3. In big policy choice, Clinton signals an important campaign focus. In Democratic politics, Kamala is the Harris sister who gets the most national buzz. But Maya Harris is about to play a big role in the question of how Hillary Clinton plots her path to 270 electoral votes. Kamala Harris is the California attorney general and a 2016 Senate candidate, for the seat being vacated by Democrat Barbara Boxer. Maya Harris just signed on for a top policy role in the Clinton campaign -- and CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson reports it is a hiring with a clear message. \"One clue, I think, is Maya Harris,\" said Henderson. \"Her resume is really a liberal's dream.  She has worked at the Center for American Progress, ACLU, she's also done work on community policing and police reforming, and she also has a very interesting paper that looks at the importance of women of color to the electorate.\" \"So I think this hire is going to be really interesting in what it means for the kind of policy initiatives that Hillary Clinton rolls out and the sort of appeals she makes to women of color, who are so crucial to getting the Obama coalition back together again.\" 4. Walker-Rubio? Rubio-Walker? A general contrast with some GOP buzz. Marco Rubio drew a direct generational contrast with Hillary Clinton when he officially joined the GOP 2106 race, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also often talks of his hope Republicans will look for a next-generation leader as their next presidential nominee. In political circles -- meaning among junkies and strategists -- there is constant debate about potential tickets -- at this stage of the process a hypothetical and then some because neither man has been tested on the trail. But Jonathan Martin of The New York Times says his recent travels suggest the talk about a Walker-Rubio pairing is not limited to inside the Beltway chatter. \"They both would offer that kind of generational dynamic in the same way that Clinton and Gore did ... in 1992,\" said Martin. \"But what's interesting is, in New Hampshire over the weekend, I was there for the big cattle call of all the candidates, for the first time from an actual activist -- not an operative but an activist -- I heard somebody float the idea of a Walker-Rubio race in 2016.\" 5. Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and then? Heading into the 2016 cycle, the Republican National Committee used its muscle to make some changes to the presidential nominating process, including fewer sanctioned debates and a primary calendar that was less front-loaded. Now, some big GOP establishment figures are worried the changes could help candidates who make the establishment cringe -- especially Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina keep their traditional slots at the front end of the calendar. Florida is usually the next big contest, but it could be eclipsed by -- sports fans will get this -- what is becoming known as the \"SEC primary.\" It is important to note the exact calendar is still a work in progress. But what worries the establishment is the likelihood of a Super Tuesday -- or maybe back-to-back Tuesdays -- in early March that include a number of conservative Southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas, Georgia, maybe Louisiana. The shift is one reason former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee thinks the 2016 environment could be more favorable to him than 2008. Ditto for Rick Santorum. They did well in the South, but it didn't matter much because John McCain and Mitt Romney, respectively, were well on their way to the nomination by the time those bruises were inflicted. Again, there might yet be more changes. But more and more leading establishment figures are grumbling changes designed with the best of intentions might end up hurting their favorites -- people like Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio -- and helping those with strong evangelical connections -- like Huckabee and Cruz.\n\noutput:",

Last week, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found guilty on all 30 charges he faced related to the bombings at the 2013 race and the dramatic violence that dragged out for days afterward. A look at all of the charges. The sentencing phase begins Tuesday, a day after this year's edition of the landmark race. It is expected to last four weeks. The 13th Juror: Now it gets real. In a front-page opinion piece in The Boston Globe, Bill and Denise Richard wrote about the toll taken on their family after the death of their 8-year-old son, Martin. Their daughter, Jane, also was severely injured. \"Our family has grieved, buried our young son, battled injuries, and endured numerous surgeries -- all while trying to rebuild lives that will never be the same,\" they said in the Globe column titled \"To end the anguish, drop the death penalty.\" \"We sat in the courtroom, day after day, bearing witness to overwhelming evidence that included graphic video and photographs, replicated bombs, and even the clothes our son wore his last day alive.\" They said they understood the \"heinousness and brutality of the crimes committed.\" \"We were there. We lived it. The defendant murdered our 8-year-old son, maimed our 7-year-old daughter, and stole part of our soul.\" But now the Richards are urging the Justice Department to bring the case to a close. \"We are in favor of and would support the Department of Justice in taking the death penalty off the table in exchange for the defendant spending the rest of his life in prison without any possibility of release and waiving all of his rights to appeal,\" they wrote. They go on to say: \"We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives. We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring.\" Martin Richard and two others were killed and more 200 people wounded when a pair of bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other at the finish line on April 15, 2013. Tsarnaev was convicted last week, while his brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a shootout with police two years ago. The Richards never mention Tsarnaev by name. They stress that they were only speaking for themselves when they argue against the death penalty. \"We believe that now is the time to turn the page, end the anguish, and look toward a better future -- for us, for Boston, and for the country,\" they wrote.\n\noutput:",

The aircraft went down overnight Monday about 2 miles east of the Central Illinois Regional Airport in Bloomington, McLean County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Bill Tate said. That's about 5 miles from the campus of Illinois State, where Ward and Leetch both worked. It was not immediately known who else was on the aircraft, which the National Transportation Safety Board tweeted was a Cessna 414. The plane was coming back from the NCAA Final Four championship game in Indianapolis, according to Illinois State athletics spokesman John Twork. \"The ISU community is reeling from the loss,\" Twork said. The last post from a Twitter account that purportedly belongs to Ward features pictures from Lucas Oil Stadium, where Duke beat Wisconsin in the title game. There's also a picture of a small plane with the words, \"My ride to the game wasn't bad #indy2015f4.\" In a statement, Illinois State University President Larry Dietz remembered Ward and Leetch as \"well-respected and much-loved colleagues in our athletics department\" in the crash near Bloomington. \"Words cannot fully express the grief that is felt in the wake of such a tragedy,\" Dietz said. \"We move between shock and profound sadness.\" A standout player at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in his hometown between 1996 and 2000, Ward played professionally in China alongside Yao Ming before getting into coaching. He was part of the staffs at Jacksonsville State University, the University of Mississippi and, for one year, in China before coming to Illinois State as an assistant prior to the 2012 season. He was promoted to associate head coach in May 2014, according to his official bio. Coming from Arkansas State University, Leetch joined ISU in 2005 as an athletic director for development before assuming a number of other roles through 2011, his bio notes. Leetch left the Illinois school to serve as director of athletics at Whitworth University in Spokane, Washington, then came back in June 2013 as ISU's deputy director of athletics. He was in charge of the Redbirds' athletics communications and video production units, and had a hands-on role in its football, men's basketball, golf and baseball programs. Athletic Director Larry Lyons described Leetch as \"a shining star in the business,\" while lauding Ward as \"a talented coach and recruiter\" with a big personality who was loved by fans. \"There is no play in the playbook for times like these,\" Lyons said. \"We will miss Aaron and Torrey deeply, and we will support their families in any way that we can.\" People we've lost in 2015.\n\noutput:",

Coltrane on TV's \"The Dukes of Hazzard,\" died Monday after a brief illness. He was 88. Best died in hospice in Hickory, North Carolina, of complications from pneumonia, said Steve Latshaw, a longtime friend and Hollywood colleague. Although he'd been a busy actor for decades in theater and in Hollywood, Best didn't become famous until 1979, when \"The Dukes of Hazzard's\" cornpone charms began beaming into millions of American homes almost every Friday night. For seven seasons, Best's Rosco P. Coltrane chased the moonshine-running Duke boys back and forth across the back roads of fictitious Hazzard County, Georgia, although his \"hot pursuit\" usually ended with him crashing his patrol car. Although Rosco was slow-witted and corrupt, Best gave him a childlike enthusiasm that got laughs and made him endearing. His character became known for his distinctive \"kew-kew-kew\" chuckle and for goofy catchphrases such as \"cuff 'em and stuff 'em!\" upon making an arrest. Among the most popular shows on TV in the early '80s, \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" ran until 1985 and spawned TV movies, an animated series and video games. Several of Best's \"Hazzard\" co-stars paid tribute to the late actor on social media. \"I laughed and learned more from Jimmie in one hour than from anyone else in a whole year,\" co-star John Schneider, who played Bo Duke, said on Twitter. \"Give Uncle Jesse my love when you see him dear friend.\" \"Jimmy Best was the most constantly creative person I have ever known,\" said Ben Jones, who played mechanic Cooter on the show, in a Facebook post. \"Every minute of his long life was spent acting, writing, producing, painting, teaching, fishing, or involved in another of his life's many passions.\" Born Jewel Guy on July 26, 1926, in Powderly, Kentucky, Best was orphaned at 3 and adopted by Armen and Essa Best, who renamed him James and raised him in rural Indiana. Best served in the Army during World War II before launching his acting career. In the 1950s and 1960s, he accumulated scores of credits, playing a range of colorful supporting characters in such TV shows as \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"Bonanza,\" \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and \"Gunsmoke.\" He later appeared in a handful of Burt Reynolds' movies, including \"Hooper\" and \"The End.\" But Best will always be best known for his \"Hazzard\" role, which lives on in reruns. \"Jimmie was my teacher, mentor, close friend and collaborator for 26 years,\" Latshaw said. \"I directed two of his feature films, including the recent 'Return of the Killer Shrews,' a sequel he co-wrote and was quite proud of as he had made the first one more than 50 years earlier.\" People we've lost in 2015.

Best began his acting career after serving in the Army during World War II and accumulated numerous credits in the 1950s and 1960s on shows like \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"Bonanza,\" \"The Andy Griffith Show,\" and \"Gunsmoke.\" He later worked with Burt Reynolds in films such as \"Hooper\" and \"The End.\" Best is survived by his longtime friend and Hollywood colleague, Steve Latshaw, who described him as a constantly creative person. Best will be remembered for his iconic role on \"The Dukes of Hazzard.\"",

About 4,500 people have been isolated by flood waters as \"the roads are cut off and we won't be able to reach them for a few days,\" Michael Langley, spokesman for the New South Wales State Emergency Service said. Devastating winds lashed cars and homes. The storm system also brought destructive flooding that washed away houses and brought down trees onto streets and buildings. The emergency services have been slammed with 13,000 calls for help due to flooding and have carried out 144 rescue tasks. The powerful storm has already claimed four lives, according to New South Wales Police. The dangerous conditions have prompted the police department to issue pleas on social media for people to not attempt driving through flooded areas. The heavy flooding prompted school and college closures and disruptions to public transportation. The adverse weather was caused by an intense low pressure system, said Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. The strongest wind gusts peaked at 135 km/h (85 mph) and it was estimated that about 200 millimeters (7.87 inches) of rainfall fell in the area on Tuesday. Transport NSW, which provides public transportation throughout the New South Wales area, issued a warning that many public services across the region have been disrupted because of the weather. It also posted a video on its Facebook page showing CCTV footage of a flood waters rising in a train station. Samantha Mancuso was driving in her neighborhood of Liverpool, a suburb in Sydney on Wednesday, when she noticed gallons of water pouring into the streets. She said Joe Broad Reserve, a nearby park, was flooded. The severe weather caused a local creek to break its banks and now the flooding is seeping into the neighborhood. Water levels at the park reached 2.6 meters (8.5 feet) earlier in the morning, but have slightly receded, she said.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nOfficer Michael Slager's five-year career with the North Charleston Police Department in South Carolina ended after he resorted to deadly force following a routine traffic stop. Slager, 33, has been fired, officials said Wednesday. His wife is eight months' pregnant and the city will continue paying for her medical insurance until the baby is born, North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey told reporters. He also has two stepchildren. His mother was interviewed by ABC News on Thursday. She told ABC her son loved being a police officer. \"I can't imagine him doing something that. ... It's not like him. That's just not his character,\" Karen Sharpe said. She told ABC she hasn't watched the video of the shooting. Slager initially told investigators that he used a Taser in a confrontation Saturday with Walter Scott, who was pulled over for a busted taillight. But Scott went for the Taser, according to Slager. A widely circulated video of the shooting death of the 50-year-old unarmed African-American man by the white police officer tells another story: Scott attempts to run. His back is to Slager, who, from a few yards away, raises his gun and fires. Slager is now charged with murder. The FBI is involved in the investigation of the slaying of the father of four. \"Shots fired and the subject is down,\" Slager said moments after the shooting, according to reports. \"He took my Taser.\" Slager was proficient with the nonlethal Taser. According to personnel records, he scored 50 out of 50 on a Taser certification exam in 2011. Before the officer starts firing at Scott, the video shows a dark object falling behind him and hitting the ground. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when Slager approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. Again, it's not clear whether that's the Taser. It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. Slager was named in a police complaint in 2013 after he allegedly \"tased a man for no reason\" before slamming him to the ground and dragging him, according to the North Charleston Police Department. At the time, Slager was searching for a suspect who was described as being 5-feet-5-inches tall. The African-American man he confronted was 6-feet-3 inches tall. A lawyer for the man who filed the complaint, Mario Givens, said his client plans to file a lawsuit. \"The citizens of North Charleston shouldn't have to live in the fear,\" the lawyer, Eduardo Curry, told reporters Thursday. Givens said Slager came to his door, ordered him out of the house and then tased him. \"It was painful,\" he said. \"I fell. I have a couple bruises.\" Slager was later cleared in that incident. \"I was upset,\" Givens said. \"They took a real long time to even investigate the case.\" In another complaint in January, Slager was cited for failing to file a report after an African-American woman called police because her children were being harassed. Slager had worked as a waiter before joining the military, records show. He served in the U.S. Coast Guard from 2003 to 2009, according to a job application filed with the North Charleston Police Department. That application, filed in January 2009, said Slager had not been convicted of a felony in the past seven years. Personnel documents describe Slager as \"enthused\" when he joined the force and said he demonstrated \"great officer safety tactics\" in dealing with suspects. South Carolina senators, governor condemn police shooting. Slager's annual in-service mandatory training included a range of topics from first aid to firearms and Taser use. Slager passed his certifications. In August, Slager passed a firearms qualification. From 2009 to 2014, Slager qualified in the use of his Glock firearm. He received and passed yearly training in \"bias based profiling\" and \"ethics,\" the documents said. He also was certified by the S.C. Criminal Justice Academy in March 2013 as having \"met and successfully completed the in-service requirements\" as a law enforcement officer. Slager completed a separate 10-hour \"active shooter incident response training\" course in December 2013. According to the documents, Slager was involved in a \"nonpreventable\" traffic accident last year when a motorist with his car in reverse struck the officer's patrol car.  The driver fled the scene. Since graduating from the police academy in 2010, a supervisor twice noted in training reports that he \"spoke with (Slager) in reference to certain procedures in reference to conducting motor vehicle stops and citizen contacts.\" No other details were provided. Slager signed his oath of office with the police force on March 1, 2010, pledging to \"faithfully serve the citizens of this city\" and \"never abuse my authority either by words or acts.\" \"I will enforce the law courteously and appropriately without fear or favor, malice or ill will, never employing unnecessary force or violence,\" the oath said. Who was Walter Scott? CNN's John Newsome contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nDid former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez kill Odin Lloyd, a man who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee and might have become his future brother-in-law? Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder and two weapons charges, setting the stage for his trial in Fall River, Massachusetts, that began in January. He's accused of orchestrating  the shooting death of Lloyd. During closing arguments, Prosecutor William McCauley called the football player the trigger man. Jury deliberations began Tuesday. Even after closing arguments, the motive is still unclear but not legally required to get a conviction. Still, jurors like to know a motive. Evidence collected in Lloyd's death led to two more murder charges against Hernandez in a separate case in Boston. It's scheduled to begin in May, but officials say it will be pushed back. The trial has involved a complicated cast of characters, including two sisters who played important roles in the lives of Hernandez and Lloyd. Here is a primer:. Inside the case against Aaron Hernandez. Odin Lloyd. Odin Lloyd was a 27-year-old semi-pro football player for the Boston Bandits.  He was found dead on June 17, 2013, less than a mile from Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. He had been shot six times. Lloyd met Hernandez while dating Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. Hernandez is charged with orchestrating Lloyd's execution. Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado were killed outside a Boston nightclub on July 16, 2012. Earlier that evening, prosecutors say, de Abreu accidentally bumped into Hernandez, spilling a drink.  Later that night, Hernandez was driving an SUV and allegedly pulled up alongside de Abreu and Furtado's car near the nightclub and fired a .38-caliber revolver at them, killing them. The trial judge in the Lloyd case barred any mention of the Boston deaths, ruling it would be prejudicial. Alexander Bradley. Authorities say  Alexander Bradley is Hernandez's former right hand man  who was allegedly with Hernandez  on the night de Abreu and Furtado were killed. He is not facing any charges in that case, but he is jailed on unrelated charges. He is suing Hernandez for allegedly shooting him in the face in February 2013, four months before Lloyd's death. Bradley says Hernandez accused him of \"disrespecting him\" over a cell phone left in a Miami strip club.  Bradley testified against Hernandez in Lloyd's death, telling jurors he saw Hernandez handling what appeared to be a Glock semi-automatic pistol during a trip to Florida. The trial barred him from saying he accused Hernandez of shooting him in the face. Carlos Ortiz. Carlos Ortiz, nicknamed Charlie Boy, is also charged with murder in the death of Lloyd and has pleaded not guilty. A law enforcement source says he cooperated with police and described the night of Lloyd's death. Ernest Wallace. Ernest Wallace is also charged with murder in the death of Lloyd. He has pleaded not guilty and is being tried separately.  Prosecutors call him the \"muscle man\" for Hernandez. They say he was in the car with Hernandez, Lloyd, and Carlos Ortiz an hour before the car is seen on video heading to the industrial park where Lloyd was killed. Shayanna Jenkins. Shayanna Jenkins is Hernandez's fiancee and the mother of their daughter. She is charged with perjury, accused of lying to a grand jury about guns in their home. She has pleaded not guilty. Her sister, Shaneah, was dating Lloyd at the time of his death. Shaneah Jenkins. Shaneah Jenkins is the girlfriend of Lloyd. Her sister is Hernandez's fiancée. In court, the two sisters sit on opposite sides, Shayanna with the defense and Shaneah with the prosecution. Tanya Cummings-Singleton. Tanya Cummings-Singleton is a cousin of Hernandez. In her garage, police found the SUV allegedly driven by Hernandez and linked to the 2012 Boston double homicide. She was twice charged with contempt of court for refusing to testify before two grand juries despite immunity offers. She has pleaded guilty to obstruction in the Lloyd case. She is also suffering from cancer. Thaddeus Singleton. Thaddeus Singleton, husband of Tanya Cummings-Singleton, was killed in a car accident after Lloyd's slaying. Police say his speeding car went airborne and crashed. A source says police planned to interview him about his relationship with Hernandez. Shaquilla Thibou. Shaquilla Thibou is the sister of Lloyd. At trial she testified she saw her brother get into a car with three men who turned out to be Hernandez, Wallace and Ortiz before he was killed. Prosecutors say she received a final text from her brother that night minutes before he was shot telling her he was with \"Nfl,\" adding, \"just so u know.\" The judge has ruled that text inadmissible at trial, saying there is no proof it meant Lloyd feared for his life. Terri Hernandez. Terri Hernandez is Aaron Hernandez's mother. She is a school secretary. Dennis Hernandez. Dennis Hernandez was Aaron Hernandez's father. He had a close relationship with his sons and was deeply involved in their sports training. He died unexpectedly after hernia surgery when Hernandez was 16. DJ Hernandez. DJ Hernandez is Aaron Hernandez's older brother. He was a star high school athlete. He also was a standout athlete at the University of Connecticut and is an assistant coach at the University of Iowa. The prosecution. District Attorney Samuel Sutter, who had been leading the prosecution against Hernandez, is the newly elected mayor of Fall River, where the trial is being held. Assistant District Attorneys William McCauley and Patrick Bomberg are on the team leading the case against Hernandez.  \"Probably my career ... will be defined more by this case than all of the other things we've done,\" Sutter has said. The defense. Attorneys James Sultan, Michael Fee and Charles Rankin are handling Hernandez's defense. In opening statements, Fee said Hernandez \"was planning a future, not a murder.\"  Before trial, Rankin said he is confident Hernandez will be exonerated.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nI don't always talk about news events with my daughters, but there was something about the story of ESPN reporter Britt McHenry and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up. One of the main things I preach to my girls, ages 7 and 9, is the importance of respecting other people, no matter who you are and what you go on to accomplish. It's something that my husband and I just do -- we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the President of the United States. Let me say right here that I have lost my cool from time to time, whether it's been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant. In those cases, when I feel like I'm going to pop, I keep saying, \"This is unacceptable, This is unacceptable,\" and either hang up in disgust or storm off. (Not perfect ways of handling these incidents, but at no time would I ever think to insult or demean the other person in these situations.) Some of McHenry's comments, such as how she's \"on television,\" imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she, by dint of her career, education and income, is better than people who don't get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities. McHenry showed that she either forgot those \"golden rule\" lessons from childhood or that she hasn't really lived her life with that mantra. McHenry has since apologized on Twitter, saying she said \"some insulting and regrettable things,\" and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in Virginia,  she should \"always choose to be respectful and take the high road.\" But it's not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker. \"I see this Britt McHenry video, and think: it's not just about how a celebrity shouldn't act in public, it's how all of us shouldn't act,\" wrote \"Cait\" on Twitter. Said \"Shannon,\" also on Twittter, \"I had no idea who Britt McHenry was before but ... now I know she's the kind of woman I hope I've taught my daughters not to be.\" \"Her language and disdain brings shame on her, her profession, and her employer. People don't all of sudden have such a vile tirade. This comes after years of practice and a pattern of similar behaviors. Let's let her be an example to others,\" wrote C Cooper on a Change.org petition asking McHenry's employers to fire her. The McHenry story seemed to strike a chord in our household because my older daughter asked what was going to happen to her. This morning, I told her McHenry was suspended for a week by ESPN, and that led to another conversation. My kids seemed to get it and many celebrities also seem to remember to \"treat other people the way you would want them to treat you\" even in uncomfortable moments. Celebrity apologies: The good, bad and uncomfortable. So, Britt McHenry, check out these examples of how the rich, famous and powerful handled stressful situations with grace and dignity. After British journalist Katie Hopkins seriously fat-shamed pop music star Kelly Clarkson, saying a host of insulting things about the singer's weight, Clarkson won praise for her graceful response. \"That's because she doesn't know me. I'm awesome. It doesn't bother me. It's a free world. Say what you will. I've just never cared what people think,\" she said. A college baseball player gets suspended for calling Little League baseball phenom Mo'ne Davis a \"slut.\" Her response? She emailed Bloomsburg University asking that the college reinstate him. \"Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance,\" Davis, the first girl to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in Little League World Series history, told ESPN. \"... I know right now he's really hurt and I know how hard he worked to get where he is. I mean, I was pretty hurt on my part but I know he's hurting even more.\" When an Argentinian journalist wrote an open letter to Pope Francis expressing concern about the pontiff meeting with the country's president ahead of the general election in October and possibly influencing the outcome, what did the Pope do? Well, he picked up the phone and gave the journalist a call. Wish we could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation! The pope appears to have been more than graceful, because after the conversation, the journalist pledged to learn how to pray. When Queen Bey faced immense criticism after allegedly lip-synching the national anthem in honor of President Obama's inauguration in 2013, she didn't come out swinging. Instead, she admitted to singing along with her \"pre-recorded track\" at the inauguration but only after she opened her news conference with what was described as a stirring, a cappella rendition of the national anthem. Finally, Reese Witherspoon may be the closest example for McHenry to consider when it comes to overcoming a very offensive episode. When Witherspoon and her husband were pulled over in 2013 for suspicion of driving under the influence, the Academy Award winning actress was recorded making comments to the officer such as, \"Do you know who I am?\" and \"You're about to find out who I am.\" She ultimately issued an apologetic statement, and then went on morning television to apologize some more. \"We went out to dinner in Atlanta, and we had one too many glasses of wine, and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not,\" she said on \"Good Morning America.\" \"It's completely unacceptable, and we are so sorry and embarrassed. We know better, and we shouldn't have done that.\" And, she added, \"When a police officer tells you to stay in the car, you stay in the car. I learned that for sure,\" she told the GMA host . Now, did McHenry learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry, you never berate them for their weight, job, appearance and income? Let's hope so. Can you think of other examples where the rich and powerful responded to a stressful situation with grace instead of disrespect? Share your thoughts with Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.\n\noutput:",

The two former friends have enjoyed, or rather endured, a heated rivalry since falling out last season and Rosberg's annoyance at Hamilton's last ditch success was obvious. The German appeared upset as he left his car and refused to shake Hamilton's hand. He did, however, find time to congratulate fellow German driver Sebastian Vettel, who will start in third after the Ferrari driver surprisingly won the Malaysian GP two weeks ago. \"I don't actually mind him having more (poles),\" a nonplussed Hamilton told AFP after the session. \"He can have the trophy for most poles. As long as I have the trophy for winning -- that's all that matters. Ultimately qualifying is not the end of the world.\" \"I am frustrated\" In the post qualifying press conference Rosberg appeared more magnanimous, but still shocked by Hamilton's last minute burst of speed. \"I was frustrated, I am frustrated, yeah,\" Rosberg admitted. \"It's so close and of course I would have wanted to have pole today... It's just four hundredths and that makes it even more annoying because it's just very, very close. A lap is never 100 per cent perfect and four hundredths is really the blink of an eye.\" Kimi Raikkonen will join his teammate Vettel on the second row and will be looking for a repeat of Ferrari's performance in Malaysia, which shocked Mercedes and Hamilton in particular. Huge support. But Hamilton has been quickest all weekend and will enjoy a surprising amount of support in Shanghai, a track the British driver has always thrived on. \"Have you seen the banners that I have here?\" he told the assembled press when asked why he liked racing at Shanghai so much. \"The support I have here's pretty unreal.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nOn the stage of a TV studio in Phnom Penh, Cambodian-American Ly Sivhong is telling an engrossed audience a tragic, but familiar, story. On April 17, 1975 -- 40 years ago today -- life as Ly knew it was shattered when her hometown, the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, fell to the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime of the Communist Party of Kampuchea. Ly, then 13, was separated from her mother and two of her sisters who, along with virtually the entire population of Phnom Penh -- about two million people -- were sent on a forced march into the countryside to work. Ly never saw them again, nor learned what happened to them. But about 20,000 people died from execution, starvation or exhaustion during this exodus at gunpoint, according to war crimes prosecutors; the others were subjected to slave labor in rural camps once they reached their destination, where many met similar fates. The urban evacuation marked the first phase in the Khmer Rouge's revolutionary program of social engineering, intended to establish a new order -- free of money, family ties, religion, education, property and foreign influence. Aimed at creating an agrarian utopia, it would instead prove one of the worst genocides of the modern era, resulting in the deaths of at least 1.7 million Cambodians -- about a quarter of the country's population -- over the next four years. Ly remained in the capital with her father and four other siblings, three of whom would succumb to starvation and disease in the following years, before her father was shot to death before her eyes in 1979. His killing prompted Ly to leave her sole remaining family member, youngest sister Bo, in the care of a local couple. She set out on her own, making her way to a refugee camp and eventually to the United States. For more than 30 years she has wondered what happened to her baby sister. \"I think she was the only family member to survive,\" she says, with tears in her eyes. As she finishes her story, the producers usher a woman on the stage. It's Bo. Ly embraces her sister and both women sob. \"I missed you so much,\" Ly says. \"I've always searched for you,\" Bo tells her. Since production began five years ago, the television show, \"It's Not A Dream,\" has reunited members of 54 Cambodian families shattered by the genocide. More than 1,500 have sought its help. The series is just one example of the ways in which Cambodia's traumatized society is beginning to undertake the fraught, painful business of reckoning with their history. \"The scars of the Khmer Rouge are very deep and physical and present in modern Cambodia,\" said Theary Seng, a human rights lawyer whose parents were killed by the regime, and who moved to the U.S. as a refugee before returning to her homeland as an adult. She described the country as a \"land of orphans.\" For decades after the Khmer Rouge were driven from Phnom Penh by Soviet-backed Vietnamese forces in January 1979, the regime's crimes were seldom spoken about, let alone attempts made to seek redress for victims. In large part, this was because people remained scared, say experts. Far from being snuffed out by the Vietnamese invasion, the Khmer Rouge existed for another two decades. After fleeing the capital in 1979, Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot and his supporters established a stronghold in the west. They continued as an insurgent guerrilla force and became part of a government-in-exile that, until 1990, was recognized by the U.N. as the country's only legitimate representative. \"In many villages, people have been living side by side with the executioners for decades,\" said Krisna Uk, executive director of the Center for Khmer Studies. Craig Etcheson, a Cambodia expert at the School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution at George Mason University, said that \"for many years, there was a virtual taboo on even speaking of the Khmer Rouge, as if the very words were ... a malevolent spirit lurking in the corner of every room.\" The silence was also due to the fact that Cambodians, in Seng's words, \"lacked the vocabulary\" of therapy and healing to process a crime of the magnitude of the one perpetrated against their society. The Khmer Rouge's attempts to reboot society at \"Year Zero\" had involved a concentrated effort to exterminate the country's educated classes -- doctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers, merchants and clergy. \"Nearly two generations of young Cambodian men grew up learning little more than how to kill,\" said Etcheson. \"When it was finally time to rebuild, there were effectively no bootstraps with which the country could pull itself up again.\" Even today, said Uk, young Cambodians are not taught about the genocide in high school. In an impoverished country -- one of Asia's poorest, albeit with 7% predicted economic growth this year -- most young people seemed to be focused on getting ahead than looking back, she said. Some were even skeptical that the Khmer Rouge's crimes -- the systematic butchery of the \"killing fields\" -- had really occurred, she added. The space for discussing, redressing and healing from the genocide only began to open up in the past decade with the establishment of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, said Seng. Founded in 2006, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) is a \"hybrid\" tribunal using both Cambodian and international judges and staff to investigate the Khmer Rouge's crimes against humanity and bring leading regime figures to justice. Intended as a southeast Asian equivalent of the Nuremberg trials, the tribunal, which has cost $232 million so far, initially enjoyed broad support. \"We had great hope for this process,\" said Seng. \"The presence of the international community raised the comfort level of the population to speak about the Khmer Rouge crimes.\" But the pace of proceedings has seemed glacial, given the advancing years of the suspected war criminals, two of whom have died while facing trial. Another was ruled mentally unfit to stand trial. (The Khmer Rouge's top leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998, having never faced charges.) This, coupled with persistent accusations of political interference from the Cambodian government, has soured attitudes towards the court. Seng, who once appeared as a civil party in proceedings, today regards it as a \"sham.\" For many victims, it is \"too little, too late.\" OPINION: An ongoing struggle for justice after the Khmer Rouge. In the first case heard, Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Comrade Duch -- commandant of the notorious Tuol Sleng prison where more than 14,000 people were killed -- received a life sentence for war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder and torture. The court's only other verdicts, delivered in August last year, sentenced Non Chea, the regime's \"Brother Number Two,\" and Khieu Samphan, \"Brother Number Four,\" to life. Both men have appealed their convictions. In a separate case, the pair are on trial on additional charges of crimes against humanity and genocide. Evidence is expected to continue being heard into 2016, ECCC spokesman Lars Olsen said. Two further, and highly controversial cases, known as 003 and 004, are also currently under investigation. Three people were charged last month in relation to those cases: former Khmer Rouge navy commander Meas Muth; Im Chaem, a former district commander accused of leading a labor camp; and Ao An, a former deputy accused of overseeing massacres at detention centers. Two other suspects are being investigated. Olsen said no further cases would be pursued after 003 and 004. Prime Minister Hun Sen, Cambodia's strongman leader for decades, has long been a vocal opponent of 003 and 004, claiming that pursuing the cases could push the country towards civil war. Hun Sen himself is a former Khmer Rouge battalion commander, who defected to the Vietnamese side; his perceived political interference is viewed by critics like Seng as an attempt to shield political allies from the tribunal. Others are more forgiving of the tribunal's shortcomings. Etcheson, a former investigator for the tribunal, has described it as an \"imperfect vessel\" for delivering justice, but says Cambodia's leaders must strike a balance between two imperatives: delivering justice for victims, and completing the reintegration of former Khmer Rouge into society. He said the most important aspects of the tribunal's work are those that take place outside the courtroom -- triggering changes in Cambodian society. \"In that respect, the proceedings ... may be shaping up to be more successful than anyone could have hoped,\" he added. Undoubtedly, Cambodians today have overcome the fear of talking about the genocide -- to the extent that even the perpetrators feel emboldened to say their piece. Krisna Uk said the country has seen a wave of Khmer Rouge memoirs, written by former cadres wanting to argue their case before they die. \"There's a lot of people who want to tell the world they've been fooled by a grand idea of a revolution which went bad,\" she said. Khieu Samphan, \"Brother Number Four,\" published one such effort ahead of his trial, while Sikoeun Suong, a Sorbonne-educated former diplomat for the Khmer Rouge regime, published his \"Journey of a Khmer Rouge Intellectual\" in French in 2013. He told an interviewer from France's Le Monde last year that he believed that Khmer Rouge dictator Pol Pot's prescriptions for Cambodia were sound. \"I remain convinced that the Marxist analysis made by Pol Pot of the socioeconomic situation of Cambodia, a poor and sparsely populated country, was correct,\" he said. For survivors, these self-serving justifications for crimes gone unpunished must be hard to take. But for a few of them, at least, Cambodia's opening up about the genocide has finally brought about the prospect of some healing, however bittersweet. On the stage of the \"It's Not a Dream\" studio, as Ly hugs her long-lost sister, footage of an even older woman is projected on a screen. \"Do you know the person in the video?\" the show's host asks. \"Yes,\" Ly says. \"She is my mother.\" Moments later, Te Souymoy, 77, is brought up on stage. \"Where have you two been?\" Te asks. \"I always worried about you two.\" \"I thought you died,\" Ly says. The three women cry and embrace. \"It is very miserable for all of us,\" the old woman says.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "On April 17, 1975, Cambodian-American Ly Sivhong, then 13, experienced the devastating fall of Phnom Penh to the Khmer Rouge regime, resulting in the forced evacuation of about two million people. During this exodus, approximately 20,000 people died from execution, starvation, or exhaustion. The Khmer Rouge's revolutionary program aimed to create an agrarian utopia but instead led to the deaths of at least 1.7 million Cambodians over the next four years. Ly, who lost her mother and two sisters during this period, has been searching for her baby sister, Bo, for over 2006. The television show \"It's Not A Dream\" has reunited 54 Cambodian families and helped over 2006 people. The Khmer Rouge's crimes were long silenced due to fear and the regime's continued existence as an insurgent force until 2006. The Khmer Rouge Tribunal was established in 2006 to investigate and prosecute Khmer Rouge crimes against humanity and genocide. The tribunal has faced criticism for its slow progress and perceived political interference from the Cambodian government. Despite these challenges, the tribunal's impact extends beyond the courtroom, shaping Cambodian society",

The 2013 attack, known as \"Dark Seoul,\" paralyzed an estimated 48,000 computers at a number of major banks and broadcasters, disrupting network systems and wiping their hard disks clean. \"It would try to delete essentially all your files... then restart the system. You would come back up and nothing would be there,\" Joshua James, a digital forensic expert, told CNN. \"If it infected more financial systems, it could have deleted all financial data in Korea. I mean, it is dangerous,\" the visiting professor at Chuncheon's Hallym University added. Live footage of the breaches showed computer screens at the media companies completely down, while bank customers were unable to make withdrawals, or transfer money online. \"Dark Seoul\" happened shortly after the North Korean government announced it would end the armistice agreement that brought the three-year Korean War to an end in July 1953 amid growing tensions with its neighbor. The latest high-profile digital incursion, in December, attempted to steal data from South Korea's nuclear operator, including plant blueprints and personnel information. Though investigators said no critical data was stolen, the attack raised serious concerns about the safety and security of the 23 nuclear power plants it runs. The attack itself was described by James as a \"spear-fishing\" exercise where unsuspecting victims -- retired and current employees of the nuclear operator -- were prompted to open up a disguised document in their email. \"As soon as you double click on it, it starts running in the background of your computer where you can't see ... it's also trying to open up your computer -- what we call a back door -- to give access to the infected system by the attacker,\" he told CNN. The attack, which James said was simpler than \"Dark Seoul,\" came just a few days after Sony Pictures said their systems has been \"hacked,\" another attack the South Korean authorities blamed on North Korea. \"From a law enforcement or investigation side, we're trying to actually trace back to who did it,\" said James. Seoul announced in mid-March that some of the IP addresses used in December incursion could be traced back to Shenyang, China, which can be easily accessed from the North Korean border. Codes used in the attack were said to be similar in pattern to those used by the North Koreans, South Korean authorities said. \"The malicious codes used in the attack were same in composition and working methods as \"Kimsuky\" codes known to be used by North Korea,\" the prosecutor's office that leads 17 other government agencies and Internet companies in the investigation said in the statement in March. Pyongyang has dismissed the claims it launched these attacks, calling them a \"plot and fabrication that can never win over the truth.\" But many experts say North Korea appears to be investing more in cyberwarfare because it is cheaper than spending on conventional weapons and can cause significant economic damage to its southern rival. Indeed South Korea's Defense Ministry estimates that North Korea is operating a \"cyberarmy\" of 6,000 workers as it focuses on strengthening its asymmetrical warfare capability. \"Hacks are going on all the time, constantly -- though how many actually make the news is a very small amount,\" said James. \"How many are detected in general? I think the average person would have no clue they've been hacked. \"Organizations need to invest the same amount that hackers are investing to protect themselves and right now they're not,\" he added. Many in South Korea believe not enough effort is being put into defending against cyberattacks. A report by the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade, a government-funded think tank, estimates that \"Dark Seoul\" caused about $820 million worth of damage. Its report, published in 2014, predicted that by 2020, South Korea could be exposed to hacking attacks causing up to $25 billion in economic damage.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nBoston (CNN)When the bomb went off, Steve Woolfenden thought he was still standing. That was because, as he lay on the ground, he was still holding the handles of his son's stroller. He pulled back the stroller's cover and saw that his son, Leo, 3, was conscious but bleeding from the left side of his head. Woolfenden checked Leo for other injuries and thought, \"Let's get out of here.\" That was before he noticed his Achilles tendon, which resembled transparent tape covered in blood, and his left tibia protruding from his boot. The boot was next to his left stump, he testified before a federal jury Thursday, the third day in which survivors and family members of those killed in the Boston Marathon bombing shared their stories -- often gruesome and heartbreaking -- in the sentencing phase for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The prosecution rested Thursday afternoon after attempting to convince jurors that Tsarnaev was cold-hearted and remorseless. The defense, led by famed death penalty opponent Judy Clarke, is expected to try to soften that portrayal by calling witnesses to explain Tsarnaev's difficult upbringing. Clarke will begin those efforts Monday. A group of Tsarnaev's relatives arrived at Boston's Logan International Airport on Thursday, CNN affiliate WHDH reported, but it's not clear if they plan to testify. The jury must decide whether the 21-year-old, who has been found guilty of perpetrating the attack with his now-deceased brother, will die for his crimes or spend his life in prison. Woolfenden, a biomedical researcher for the Novartis Institutes, recalled using his belt as a tourniquet on his leg and trying to comfort Leo. The boy cried, \"Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy!\" he testified. Amid the stench of \"burning hair, blood, sulfur,\" a good Samaritan emerged. He gave Woolfenden another tourniquet and rushed Leo to safety. \"I was completely terrified because I didn't know if I was ever going to see my son again. There was blood all over the sidewalk, all around me,\" he said. Dr. David King, a trauma surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, spent 14 years in the U.S. Army as a combat surgeon and served in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. He has treated and operated on hundreds of troops injured by improvised explosive devices, he testified, and what he saw in Boston that day wasn't much different from the carnage he witnessed in war zones. \"I arrived just as the first wave of casualties had shown up,\" he said. \"I looked across the patients and I knew immediately, without anyone having to tell me, exactly what the wounding mechanism was.\" Heather Abbott had no such experience, so when one of the two bombs exploded, sending her through the doors of a restaurant and into a \"puddle of chaos and blood and glass,\" her instinct was to run. But she couldn't. Her foot felt like it was on fire, she testified. Two women helped her as she overheard someone saying a Hail Mary. She called for her husband. He picked her up and carried her out of the restaurant. \"I saw blood pouring out of my foot,\" she said. She finally got to a hospital, and after three attempts to save her foot, which was missing its entire heel, a doctor told her she had a decision: She could keep her leg and risk a life of excruciating pain or have it amputated below the knee. She chose the latter. \"It was probably the hardest decision I've had to make,\" she testified. Another marathon attendee rendered an amputee by the Tsarnaev brothers' attack, Marc Fucarile, recounted the two bombs going off. \"I stepped back, and the next thing I remember was looking up at the sky,\" he testified, adding that he remembered \"a lot of yelling, a lot of screaming, people crying out for tourniquets.\" A nurse was sitting on his chest, and someone said, \"Oh, s***, he's on fire!\" He tried to undo his belt and got a third-degree burn because the buckle was so hot. A firefighter would later tell Fucarile that he handed his own right leg to the firefighter. He doesn't remember that. In addition to treating him for severe burns over much of his body, doctors had to cut off a bone and stretch muscle over the stub so that a prosthetic would fit. He still gets blisters. \"So where the prosthetic attaches on your butt, it rubs and breaks down and creates open wounds,\" he said. And though his left leg survived, it was severely burned, his calf muscle was blown off and his heel was shattered, he said. He hopes to save the left leg, he testified, but it's likely that it will have to be amputated above the knee. He takes more than 70 pills -- 24 pills in morning, 22 in afternoon, 26 at night -- to cope with his injuries, he said. One of the most dramatic points in Thursday's testimony involved the death of young Martin Richard. The prosecution showed close-up video of the 8-year-old, who was only 3½ feet from one of the bombs, according to the FBI's re-creation of the crime scene. His parents, Bill and Denise, are opposed to Tsarnaev receiving the death penalty and did not participate in the penalty phase, though Bill Richard did testify during the guilt phase. Dr. King told the court that Martin was especially vulnerable to the blast because he was so small and close to the ground, meaning the shrapnel more easily reached his head and torso. It's highly unlikely the boy died instantly, King said. Explaining that Martin died of rapid blood loss, King testified, \"Receptors are generally not responsive to cutting. If you happen to be awake and someone cuts your bowel or liver, it generally does not hurt. What hurts is the stretching and twisting. ... Intestines were pulled and twisted; that would have caused visceral type pain.\" Woolfenden, the biomedical researcher, recalled seeing Martin and his mother shortly after the good Samaritan took Woolfenden's son, Leo, to safety. \"I saw Martin's face, and I could see a boy that looked like he was fatally injured,\" he said,. Martin's hair was singed, his eyes had rolled back into his head and his mouth was agape. As for Martin's torso, \"I saw an immense amount of blood. I was really, really terrified,\" Woolfenden said. He recalled Denise Richard pleading with her son, saying, \"please\" and \"Martin\" over and over. Woolfenden placed his hand on Denise Richard's back, he said. She turned to ask Woolfenden if he was OK. He said he was, and she turned her attention back to Martin. But no response came. According to testimony, Martin's aorta was nearly severed and he was eviscerated by shrapnel from the blast. He bled to death on the sidewalk, and the last thing he probably felt was excruciating pain from the force of the blast twisting his internal organs. CNN's Patrick Cornell contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 178 words:\nAtlanta (CNN)Federal marshals have arrested Scott Kelley, a fugitive accused of kidnapping who was featured on CNN's \"The Hunt.\" Kelley, 50, was taken into custody at the Atlanta airport Wednesday after arriving on a flight from Costa Rica, Deputy U.S. Marshal Jamie Berry said. \"It was time to come home,\" Kelley told People magazine about his decision to return to the United States. Kelley has been wanted since 2004, accused of noncustodial kidnapping and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. His wife, Genevieve Kelley, who's charged with the same crimes, turned herself in to authorities last year, just a few months after the case was featured on CNN's \"The Hunt.\" Her trial is scheduled to start next month. The couple is accused of leaving New Hampshire, kidnapping Genevieve Kelley's daughter, Mary Nunes, and beginning a life on the lam when she was 8 years old. At the time, the child's father, Mark Nunes, had full custody rights. The search for the three spanned the United States, Canada and Central and South America. It ended on Monday, when Scott Kelley and Mary Nunes entered the U.S. Consulate in Costa Rica and requested passports so they could return to the United States. The consulate notified U.S. Marshals, Berry said, and when Kelley and Nunes flew to Atlanta on Wednesday investigators were waiting for them. Mary Nunes, now 19, was interviewed by investigators at the Atlanta airport to ensure her health and safety and then allowed to continue to her final destination, Berry said. Previously, authorities had said her whereabouts were unknown. CNN New Hampshire affiliate WMUR reported that the daughter plans to testify at her mother's trial. In a statement released through a private investigator he's hired in the case, her father said that he was thrilled to learn Mary is safe. \"We love Mary and are overjoyed that she is alive and back in the US. Our hearts and home are open to her, and we will do everything we can to insure she remains safe and healthy,\" Mark Nunes said in a statement. \"We remain concerned about her emotional and physical well-being. We look forward to the day our family is finally reunited.\" Kelley's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Before allegedly fleeing the country, Genevieve Kelley had accused her ex-husband of abusing their child. Investigators found no basis for the accusations and no charges were filed. On a Facebook page defending her, supporters of the mother say she did what any parent would do under the same circumstances. Photos on the page show her standing with friends holding signs that say, \"Justice for Gen! Children need protection.\" Wayne Rioux, who was then the police chief of Whitefield, New Hampshire, told \"The Hunt\" that a video Genevieve and Scott Kelley made, intended to prove their abuse allegations, aroused his suspicions. Rioux watched the tape for \"any evidence of wrongdoing by Mark Nunes.\" \"But throughout the tape all I saw was this bizarre, strange conduct by the mother,\" Rioux said, \"who was absolutely brainwashing the daughter and trying to get the daughter to say things against her daddy.\" Attorney Alan Rosenfeld has argued that Genevieve Kelley had no other option than running away with her daughter, after a court-appointed guardian and social service agencies had said they didn't believe the abuse allegations. \"Simply put, there was no lawful alternative to provide safety for this child,\" he said earlier this year, according to WMUR. Earlier this year, Brazilian police tracked down Victor Arden Barnard, another fugitive who'd been featured on \"The Hunt.\" The 53-year-old American pastor is accused of dozens of sexual assaults in Minnesota. Last year, the same day Genevieve Kelley was arrested, authorities in Texas announced that in an unrelated case, remains found were confirmed to be those of another fugitive featured on the program, Kevin Patrick Stoeser. Stoeser, a U.S. soldier who was dishonorably discharged, pleaded guilty in 2003 to child sexual assault and child pornography charges and was sentenced to 13 years behind bars. Remains of Shane Miller, another suspect featured on the \"The Hunt,\" were found last year. And Charles Mozdir, another suspect who was profiled on the show, was killed in a gunbattle with authorities. CNN's Tricia Escobedo and Slma Shelbayah contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nBoston (CNN)Adrianne Haslet-Davis and her husband, Adam Davis, were standing near the finish line on the day of the Boston Marathon bombing. Her feet were sore from wearing 4.5-inch heels. Still, they walked to Boylston Street to watch the runners. \"We were so in love and happy together,\" she told a federal jury Wednesday. It was the second day the Boston jury heard a procession of heartbreaking loss -- the survivors and families of those killed when twin bombs planted by the pair of brothers named Tsarnaev exploded near the finish line. The jury must decide whether bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. Haslet-Davis and Davis, who had just returned from a tour in Afghanistan with the Air Force, were steps away from the explosion near the Forum restaurant. She recalled the force of the blast that killed three people and injured over 200 that April day in 2013. She knew right away it was a terrorist attack. Screams and heavy smoke filled the air. She couldn't hear her own screams. She thought she was dead. When her husband, who also was injured, lifted her leg, he too let out a scream. She said she thought he was in shock. She rolled over onto her stomach and crawled over broken glass, shredding her arms. She dragged herself to the Forum. \"I saw all five of my toes, but I saw a lot of blood,\" she said. \"I didn't see my ankle.\" A ballroom dancer, Haslet-Davis' left leg would later be amputated below the knee. Inside the Forum, Haslet-Davis begged for whiskey. \"I just wanted the pain to go away. I only begged for the whiskey when I thought I was going to die.\" When someone removed Adam's shoe, an artery was spurting blood. His face got whiter and whiter, she said. His eye rolled back. She thought he was dead. At a hospital, she called her parents on her cellphone. She told them she was in a terrorist attack. \"I don't think I have a left foot anymore,\" she told her father. \"I'm in really bad shape and I really need to talk to you because this might be it.\" Her father told her he was driving and it was illegal to pull over. \"I don't care if it's illegal. I need to talk to you because these might be our last words. I said I was in a terrorist attack at the Boston Marathon and Adam is dead and this might be it for me.\" Haslet-Davis told the jury that, at the Forum, her husband kept telling her he was sorry. \"That was all he could say. That he loved me. He was so sorry.\" Her husband, she said, has since \"bravely admitted himself into a mental facility at the VA hospital.\" After her testimony, Haslet-Davis walked slowly off the stand. She appeared to glare at Tsarnaev, who did not look at her. Earlier this week, prosecutors showed jurors an image of Tsarnaev taken when he was in a holding cell. It was dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a gesture that Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said showed a young man who was \"unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged.\" On Wednesday, Tsarnaev's lawyer, Miriam Conrad, sought to discredit the use of the image. She suggested the gesture had been presented to the jury out of context. On cross-examination of a deputy U.S. marshal, Conrad showed the jury security footage from which the image was taken. In it, Tsarnaev is seen looking into the camera touching his hair. Moments before, he has two fingers up, forming what Conrad called a \"V sign,\" before raising his middle finger. Gary Olivera, a deputy U.S. Marshal for 14 years, admitted that the camera was encased in a reflective surface and Tsarnaev could have been using it as a mirror. \"A lot of times people do that to get our attention,\" Olivera said. Also Wednesday, Jinyan Zhao told the jury about her niece, Lingzi Lu, a \"beautiful nerd\" and graduate student at Boston University who was killed in the bombing. Lingzi Lu was originally from China but was buried in Boston. \"How she died, and why she died, it just felt like she is part of Boston, part of city,\" her aunt said. \"The thinking is she should just be here.\" The family, Zhao said, put a music box and some books in her casket. Her mother put a bracelet on her wrist and touched her hand. Later, her mother described her beautiful hand. Zhao recalled what Lu's mother said to her: \" 'No matter what I don't want to believe it is her hand.' \" The brother and stepfather of Sean Collier also took the stand Wednesday. Collier was the MIT police officer who was shot in his patrol car, another victim of the Tsarnaev brothers as they tried to evade capture. Sean Collier always wanted to be a cop, said his brother. He was a child who viewed life in terms of right and wrong. Either you did it or you didn't. \"We thought it was typical little boy stuff, but he never grew out of it,\" Andrew Collier told the jury. \"Sean was always the one to spill the beans,\" said Joe Rodgers, 59, who married Collier's mother, Kelly, in 1993. \"He was a cop from an early age.\" On a Thursday night in April 2013, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Officer Sean Collier lay bleeding in his patrol car after being ambushed and shot in the head. His car door was open, and his foot was lodged between the gas and brake pedals. The officer who found Collier testified at trial that he had wounds to the temple, neck and head. He was bleeding out as officers tried to revive him. Collier would become the fourth victim of the Tsarnaev brothers. The night still feels like a dream for Rodgers. \"He had a hole in the middle of his head,\" Rodgers said. \"He was shot to pieces. He was just laying there. My wife was touching him, and his blood was coming up in her hands.\" Prosecution shows what it calls Tsarnaev's defiant message to U.S. Prosecutors said the brothers killed Collier because they wanted his gun. But their efforts to take it were thwarted by a safety holster. Tamerlan, 26, was killed in a chase and gunbattle with police that began with reports of an \"officer down\" at MIT. Less than two weeks after Tsarneav was found guilty on every count, the jury deciding his punishment is hearing about the lasting impact of his deeds. Earlier, MIT Police Chief John DiFava told the jury that he hired Collier, who fit in \"perfectly\" because of his policing style and engaging personality. The MIT police, who are designated as special officers by the Massachusetts State Police, patrol the sprawling campus in Cambridge. \"The atmosphere of the department changed since April 18, 2013,\" he said. \"There is sadness and a sense of loss. I think that it will be there for as long as that generation of officers remains. It was remarkable the amount of support we got from the community, but Sean's death hangs like a weight.\" DiFava has come to question whether he wants to continue on the force. \"Policing is the only thing I've done in my life, and I've always tried to be good at what I do,\" he said. \"I lost one of my own. I have children at home and I've always thought I would have been very, very proud for them to wear the uniform. Now I'm not so sure.\" Rodgers said it took his wife, Kelly, months to gain the strength to climb out of bed after losing her son. Saturday was the second anniversary of the bombing. She cried all weekend. \"She was very strong,\" he said. \"She was a happy person. She was a good mother. Since Sean's death, she's very scared of anything that might happen to any of the other children.\" Kelly became pregnant with Sean after losing a baby that lived for a day or two, Rodgers said. His birth lifted her out of depression. \"He was special,\" he said, adding that Sean is now buried alongside the baby. Rodgers said he still feels beat down two years later. \"There's something missing,\" he said. \"Thanksgiving and Christmas will never be the same.\" Collier's brother Andrew said, \"Even when we're having fun, there's always a cloud over us. I miss Sean. I miss everything about him.\" The prosecution is expected to rest Friday, according to an official with insight into the prosecutor's plans. Poll: 53% say Tsarnaev should face death penalty. Ann O'Neill and Aaron Cooper reported from Boston, Ray Sanchez wrote in New York.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 133 words:\nIt's clear from Hillary Clinton's campaign rollout -- a video announcement/campaign ad/short film that debuted Sunday afternoon -- that she will make women and being a woman central to her outreach. In case you're skeptical, Vox has posted a handy \"by the numbers\" for her campaign video, and there are 38 people besides Clinton in the two-minute ad. Twenty of them are women. There are three separate mentions of motherhood. This is all fine and good (and predictable) if you acknowledge that the proportion of women who vote has exceeded the proportion of men who vote in every presidential election since 1980. And let's not overlook the fact that Clinton is in fact a woman, and that's a fine thing to celebrate. But in reality, she doesn't have to wonder if a woman-centered campaign is the best strategy. She can simply look back to the most recent elections to see that overplaying to one half of the eligible-voting population failed spectacularly all over the country, in red and blue states, when that strategy was employed by both male and female candidates. As I've previously written, the 2014 midterm elections saw the death of a political meme: the \"war on women.\" Granted, that's not because Republicans convinced the country that they were the party of women. But it is noteworthy that Democrats who overtly pandered to women at the expense of real issues (and men) crashed and burned. To wit:. In Colorado, Sen. Mark Udall was nicknamed \"Mark Uterus\" for all the time he spent fear-mongering on women's reproductive issues, only to end up, according to exit polls, eight points ahead among women. His opponent, Cory Gardner, finished 17 points ahead among men. In New York, a Democratic candidate for Congress, Martha Robertson, drew laughs from the audience during a debate for accusing her opponent of engaging in a \"war on women.\" To repeat, she was a woman, a Democrat, in New York. In Louisiana, Sen. Mary Landrieu sought to give her ailing campaign a boost in by part blaming sexism for Democrats' lack of popularity in the South. Not surprisingly, Southerners voted for her opponent, Bill Cassidy. In Texas, where liberal Wendy Davis ran almost entirely on an abortion-rights platform, she accused Republicans of sexism for daring to scrutinize her inaccurate biography. Her opponent, Greg Abbott, won by 20 points, and Davis only ended up with 47% of the women vote. Whether in Texas or Colorado, New York or Louisiana, voters made it clear they cared about more than just reproductive issues and weren't going to be bullied into voting Democratic by false cries of sexism. But while Democrats were screaming about the Republicans' \"war on women,\" few in the media acknowledged that the Democrats' deficit among men was actually greater than the Republicans' deficit among women. Exit polls in 2014 showed that men voted for Republicans over Democrats by a 16-point margin, and women voted for Democrats by only a four-point margin. Regardless of whom Republicans run for president, Hillary Clinton will most likely get the women vote. What she needs are men. So instead of running a woman-centered campaign, she might want to figure out a way to court the other sex.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "In the 2014 elections, Democratic candidates who heavily focused on women's issues and overtly pandered to women at the expense of addressing real issues and appealing to men suffered electoral losses, as seen in the cases of Mark Udall in Colorado, Martha Robertson in New York, Mary Landrieu in Louisiana, and Wendy Davis in Texas. Exit polls revealed that men voted for Republicans over Democrats by a larger margin (16 points) than women voted for Democrats (4 points) in 2014. While Hillary Clinton is expected to secure the women's vote in the upcoming presidential election, it is crucial for her campaign to focus on appealing to men as well.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 181 words:\nRobert Bates, 73, shot and killed a man while playing cops and robbers with real police. Bates was a reserve deputy sheriff, which allowed him to \"work full time jobs in the community and volunteer ... time in a myriad of events such as the Special Olympics and Tulsa State Fair,\" according to the Tulsa County Sheriff Office's website. But Bates wasn't limited to crowd control at sporting events for the disabled. He had taken part in more than 100 operations with the violent crimes task force, according to his lawyer.  On April 2, Bates thought he was going to use a Taser on Eric Harris, who deputies had just tackled after he sold an undercover officer a Lugar pistol and then took off running. But Bates wasn't holding a Taser. He was holding his gun. He fired one shot and killed Harris. From a policing perspective, there wasn't even good reason to use a Taser against Harris. Cops were on scene. Harris wasn't getting the upper hand. He wasn't going anywhere. And despite what Bates would later claim, Harris was not running like a man with a gun. In fact, Harris was running fast and his arms were pumping very much like a man who is not protecting a gun in his waistband. What was Bates, an insurance company CEO, doing there in the first place? It certainly looks like Bates was given special access to \"real\" policing. Harris had given $2,500 to Sheriff Stanley Glanz's re-election campaign. He donated cars to the department. He gave equipment. So it would be noteworthy if Bates ends up being convicted based on evidence provided by \"sunglass cameras\" that he may have purchased for the department. A Tulsa police official said the agency has 130 reserve deputies, many of them wealthy people who make donations to the police. \"That's not unusual at all,\" he told the Tulsa World. Maybe Bates could have been a reserve deputy without donating anything. But I doubt there are many volunteer septuagenarians working with the violent crimes task force. He was too old to be policing the streets. Tulsa police said that Bates had served a year in 1964 as a police officer. Most police departments have mandatory retirement ages. Federal law-enforcement officers, for instance, retire at 57. How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? Police officers generally look with a skeptical eye toward volunteers. For one thing, it makes it tougher to push for a pay raise when people are offering to do your job for free. But departments also know that you get what you pay for. What is the point of background checks, psychological tests and the professional training police undergo if a person can donate a few grand and go out on patrol? Some people are a little too eager to be police officers. These people perhaps buy a police-like car for their personal car. Maybe they put in a police light or two. Some have actually made car stops. Police departments hate cop impersonators (it's illegal, by the way) and try and weed them during the hiring process. You want workers who like the job, but not too much; there's a fine line between passion and fanaticism. That said, there are good volunteer police officers. New York City, for example, has auxiliary police. These officers received more limited training and they help with neighborhood events and other nonenforcement activities. They wear an NYPD uniform but do not carry a gun. Auxiliary police and similar programs reinforce the notion that the police are the public and the public are the police. Volunteers remind us all that policing is a noble public calling, and most police work does not have to be done by overly militarized SWAT officers. An auxiliary program also allows young recruits a way to dip their foot into the police world before taking the plunge. It can be a great benefit to everybody when potential officers discover the job isn't for them before they are locked into a 20-year commitment. What happened in Tulsa County is a disgrace to police professionalism, and the fallout from this disaster may push police departments to end these kinds of programs. That would be a mistake. Police departments should encourage more productive interactions between police and the public. But a line does need to be drawn.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "On April 2, 2015, 73-year-old Robert Bates, a reserve deputy sheriff in Tulsa County, shot and killed Eric Harris during a sting operation, mistaking his gun for a Taser. Bates, an insurance company CEO, had volunteered with the sheriff's office since 2000, participating in over 100 operations with the violent crimes task force. He was known for his community involvement, including work at the Special Olympics and Tulsa State Fair. However, questions have arisen about Bates' special access to \"real\" policing due to his financial contributions to the sheriff's re-election campaign and equipment donations to the department. The incident raises concerns about the role of volunteers in law enforcement and the potential for conflicts of interest. The Tulsa Police Department has 130 reserve deputies, many of whom are wealthy donors. Despite the controversy, some argue that volunteer police programs can foster positive interactions between the public and law enforcement. New York City's auxiliary police, for example, wear uniforms but do not carry guns and help with non-enforcement activities. The Tulsa County incident highlights the need for clear guidelines and oversight in volunteer police programs.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nLondon (CNN)British police investigating a spectacular heist in the heart of London's jewelry district said Friday they knew a burglar alarm went off but didn't respond. Southern Monitoring Alarm Company called the Metropolitan Police Service, also known as Scotland Yard, at 12:21 a.m. April 3 to report that the burglar alarm had been activated at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd., MPS said in a prepared statement. \"The call was recorded and transferred to the police's CAD (computer-aided dispatch) system,\" the statement said. \"A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required. We are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call. This investigation is being carried out locally. \"It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident.\" The theft was so big that police haven't come up with a value for what was stolen. Over the four-day Easter holiday, thieves broke into the vault of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. and might have been able to take as long as four days to rifle through the boxes. A former police official in London has speculated that the loss could run to £200 million, or $300 million, in a remark widely reported by news media. Numerous British news organizations put the value of the loss in the hundreds of thousands of pounds. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the London Metropolitan Police Flying Squad said police were still identifying the owners of ransacked safe deposit boxes and trying to contact them to learn what had been lost. The British tabloid The Daily Mirror claimed Friday to have obtained closed-circuit TV footage that captured the robbery being carried out. The video showed people inside the building dressed like utility workers with their faces covered. They carried large bags, what looked like drill equipment and other tools, then exited with trash bins. Toward the end of the video, a white van can be seen on a street during daytime with individuals loading back their gear and the trash bins. British police told CNN they have not released any video of the heist. When asked about the video published by the Daily Mirror, police said they could not confirm that it was footage from the Hatton Garden robbery and that officers have not seen that particular video. The Daily Mirror published time-stamped images it said showed that the thieves had been -- as was feared -- in the vault for days. The Mirror's time stamps, which CNN has not been able to independently verify, show employees locking up for the weekend at 9:19 p.m. on Thursday. If the footage, and its interpretation by the newspaper are correct, at least six people were involved in the heist. Just four minutes later, the first of the thieves, nicknamed \"Mr. Ginger\" by the newspaper for his red hair, appears in the building holding a black bag. He goes downstairs toward the vault. At 9:27 p.m., a street camera shows a white Ford Transit van pulling up to an alley beside the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit building. Men are seen dragging trash bins down the alley before the van drives away, leaving the men behind. Inside the building, at 9:30p.m., the camera records a thief nicknamed \"The Gent\" for his natty clothing -- though he also wears a hard-hat and a high-visibility jacket labeled \"Gas\" on the back. A minute later, \"Mr. Strong\" appears, wearing a builder's hat and carrying steel supports, which the newspaper speculates could have been used to support the diamond-tipped drill used to smash through the wall of the vault. At 9:36 p.m., Mr. Strong and a thief nicknamed Mr. Montana for the logo on his hooded sweatshirt roll in trash bins, one of which might have contained, according the Mirror, the 77-pound drill that bored through the reinforced seven-foot concrete wall to reach the vault. It is unclear, but the thieves may have spent the night in the basement in or near the vault. At any rate, according to the Daily Mirror, no more activity is seen above ground until Friday morning, shortly before 8:00. The white van returns, is loaded in two minutes, and drives off again. On Saturday evening, Mr. Ginger returns, two days after he was first seen. The newspaper says is wearing latex gloves and carrying a black sack. He goes downstairs toward the vault. Saturday evening also marked the first appearance of the Tall Man, who helped carry some of the loot out of the building. Early Sunday, Mr Ginger, the Tall Man and a robber nicknamed the Old Man are seen to be active. The Tall Man and the Old Man struggle to move a bin before they drag it outside. The Old Man leans on the bin, struggling for breath, and reveals the side of his face to the camera. A white van arrives by the alley and the men start loading equipment on it, including several trash bins. Three men get into the white van and, at 6:44 a.m. they are gone. The heist would not be reported to police for two more days, on Tuesday morning when employees of the company arrived for work. Police said Thursday there was no sign of forced entry. Johnson said the thieves appeared to have gained access to the vault through the shaft of an elevator that is used by several businesses in the building. The thieves disabled the elevator on the second floor of the building -- which would be called the third floor in the United States -- then climbed down the elevator shaft into the basement, he said. Once there, he said, they used a drill to bore through a 6-foot-thick wall and gain access to the vault where the safe deposit boxes were. People with knowledge of the area have speculated that cash and jewels were probably taken. Some jewelry businesses reportedly stored some of their jewels in the boxes rather than leaving it in their stores over the holiday weekend. Johnson said the scene in the vault remained chaotic as police continued their forensic examination. He said the floor was covered with dust and littered with safe deposit boxes and power tools. WATCH: Top five jewelry heists. Johnson called the crime sophisticated and said there were a limited number of people in the United Kingdom capable of pulling it off. He said he had no idea whether the thieves were still in the country. Although there was no sign of forced entry to the building, the detective said, \"whether that involves inside knowledge will form part of the investigation.\" Hatton Garden is a storied area in London and the heart of the city's diamond trade. The area's promotional website says it is home to \"the largest and most concentrated cluster of jewellery retailers in the UK\" and has been for quite some time. \"History tells us that the old City of London had certain streets -- or quarters -- dedicated to specific types of business,\" the website says. \"The Hatton Garden area has been the epicentre of London's jewellery trade since medieval times. \"Today, it maintains its international reputation as the centre of London's diamond trade. It is one of the finest and most renowned jewellery locations in the world.\" How was $4.8 million in gold swiped from a North Carolina highway? The website of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. says the company was founded in 1954 and offers a \"secure and cost-effective solution to store and protect important and irreplaceable personal belongings.\"\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nLos Angeles (CNN)She's one of the hottest and most successful Latinas in Hollywood, but now Sofia Vergara is playing defense in a legal battle initiated by her ex-fiance: He wants to keep the two frozen embryos from their relationship, both female. The 42-year-old actress and star of the hit TV sitcom \"Modern Family\" split from businessman Nick Loeb in May 2014. Loeb is suing the Colombian-born actress in Los Angeles to prevent Vergara from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization in November 2013, according to published reports by New York Daily News and In Touch magazine. The lawsuit cited by the two publications, however, lists the plaintiff as \"Joe Doe\" and the defendant as \"Jane Doe.\" The suit doesn't identify the names of the actual litigants. Instead, the suit asks the court to advance the matter anonymously to protect the two individuals' privacy. The two publications cited unidentified sources in their reports. On Tuesday, Loeb's attorney Abram Moore confirmed in a statement that Loeb filed the lawsuit. Representatives for Vergara declined to comment. Court papers allege the couple created the embryos while they were engaged, and their plan was to eventually have children together. On \"Modern Family,\" Vergara plays Gloria Delgado Pritchett, an eccentric and voluptuous Colombian immigrant who in recent episodes had a baby. But the sitcom make-believe is far from what Vergara is dealing with now. The lawsuit states the embryos should not be destroyed under any circumstances by Jane Doe until both parties reach an agreement. The suit also names as a defendant the clinic where the embryos are being held, the Art Reproductive Center in Beverly Hills. The center didn't respond to a message seeking comment Friday. According to the legal paperwork, the ex-couple had already used two surrogate mothers, one being a close friend of Jane Doe's, in an attempt to have children. However, neither of the implantations was successful. In his own statement, Loeb said he wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term, but he doesn't want any money from the egg donor. His statement doesn't directly identify Vergara as the donor, other than referring to his \"ex.\" \"I have previously offered to waive any parental or financial responsibilities or obligations on the part of my ex, and to even give her the opportunity to be involved with the child in the future, should she change her mind,\" Loeb said. He believes that \"life begins at fertilization,\" he said. \"Creating an embryo in the natural way can lead to parenthood obligations, even where a man doesn't want to become a father. Where a man does want to become a father, and wants to impose no obligations on the other party, he should have that corresponding right.  However life comes to be created, it should have no determination on either the rights of wanting to be or the requirements of having to be a parent,\" Loeb said. In an interview with ABC in April 2013, while the couple was still engaged, Vergara spoke of how she helped create embryos and what motivated her to do it. \"We just wanted to plan ahead. My boyfriend Nick is three years younger than me and he's never had a son. I have my son, Manolo, so it's not that import(ant)... you know, it's not like an emergency for me to have another kid. For Nick, yes, because he's never had a baby,\" Vergara said. During the interview she seemed excited about wanting children with Loeb. \"I already froze some eggs so, you know, I wanted to take advantage of science. Why not?\" Vergara said. The ABC anchor asked Vergara how far along she was in the process, to which the actress replied: \"I took them out already. They're in a refrigerator.\" Laughing, she added, \"Hopefully they'll be fresh by the time I use them.\" The case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos. Typically, a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority, said fertility specialist Dr. David Tourgeman, who's not involved in this case. \"Usually when embryos are created, whether the couple is married or just consenting adults, there's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos, if they are frozen for future use,\" he said. In most cases, the mother or the origin of the egg is given power of attorney, although anyone can make a request, Tourgeman said. If there's a disagreement, the courts usually get involved to decide who legally owns the embryos, he said. \"The documents that were signed during the fertility process will probably only apply in the case of death of one of the partners,\" he said. \"In the scenario where there's a disagreement as to who these embryos belong to, it will usually be decided by a court of law.\" But experts say this lawsuit is bringing up a lot of interesting issues. \"Religious, moral issues, to legal and contract issues. When does life begin? Are these embryos alive?\" said California attorney Vance Owen. \"To Catholics, for example, conception marks the beginning of life. To abortion advocates, the child has to be in a more advanced state, perhaps the third trimester, so it's a very interesting time to be discussing these life issues,\" Owen said. Owen said Loeb has a case because no court in California will allow the destruction of the embryos if both parties disagree. \"This case is a gray area of law because it's new,\" Owen said. \"It's developing as we speak,\" he said. \"It's a question, I think, of whether to decide if these frozen (embryos)are human beings or whether they are property. Since they are unborn, some states in the United States look at these (embryos) not as life, but as property.\" Owen said the lawsuit reportedly filed by Loeb will now open new issues, and a California court will have to decide to whom the embryos belong. \"These embryos are not inside her body,\" he said. \"They are in a nitrogen tank in a clinic in Beverly Hills, so there the Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri vs. Danforth case cannot be used by the Sofia Vergara team to allege that the (embryos) would present some danger to her health as they did in that case.\" In that case, the U.S. Supreme Court declared a statute that requires parental and spousal consent for abortions to be unconstitutional. The lawsuit comes as Vergara promotes her new movie, \"Hot Pursuit,\" with co-star Reese Witherspoon. Vergara is now reportedly engaged to actor Joe Manganiello. CNN's Krecyte Villarreal and Stella Chan contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nThis week, Hillary Clinton surprised the world yet again — not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it. She sure pushed the envelope. With her video, new logo and road trip, she opened a long communications campaign not only to \"rebrand\" herself but to completely reframe who she is, what she stands for and how she intends to run. We'll find out over the next year and a half whether it will work. Many in the press and on late-night television scratched their heads this week; others were scathing. Ruth Marcus --  a  columnist for the Washington Post -- dismissed her launch video as a \"relentlessly, insultingly vapid\" effort of \"demographic box-checking.\" Jon Stewart lampooned it as a \"State Farm commercial gone viral\" and also \"boring as s---.\" Since the media will likely be the stand-in primary opponent for Hillary, their belief in her authenticity is a critical factor in whether she can reframe herself in voter's eyes. But from a marketing perspective, her launch may have been much more successful than critics think. The YouTube announcement video took on the central strategic challenge for the campaign and candidate: To flip Clinton's message from self-absorbed \"I\" to empathetic \"we.\" While critics may sneer, it is hard to deny that the image it projects of Hillary is more confident, fresher, simpler and forward-looking, with even a bit of the upstart feel of two of the most successful product launch companies, Nike and Apple. Clinton's team may have begun to create an empathetic relationship with voters that has eluded her in the past, most crucially when she lost the nomination fight to Barack Obama in 2008. In marketing terms, rebranding is a strategy to bring a new name, term, symbol or design to an established brand with the aim of developing a new identity in the minds of consumers. Reframing is a strategy that goes further: it seeks to change how a consumer (or voter) emotionally experiences an established brand. A rebrand may change how you think about a brand; a reframe may change how you feel about it.  In the Apple case, the company at one time fell on its face when it unveiled the original Macintosh; some thought the company was headed for oblivion. But when Steve Jobs returned as CEO, he went back to the drawing board and soon unveiled the iPod, which not only changed the way consumers thought about Apple, but how they experienced it. Not only a rebrand -- but a reframe. Take Hillary's road trip to Iowa in the van nicknamed Scooby. The press lampooned her, but I would bet that for many others, her unscripted and anonymous stop at Chipotle reinforced the \"everyday Americans\" campaign theme. Hillary stood in line to order, an everyday customer among everyday people at an everyday fast-food chain. Also introduced last week was what will come to be the single most-ubiquitous element of her campaign: Clinton's new and controversial  campaign logo. It is a brilliant, iconic expression of the emotional connection she wants people to have with her, her message and her movement.  In fact, her logo is all about movement. Simple, confident, high tech and shorthand to a much younger set of voters, the bold red arrow moving left to right in front of the strong blue H says it all: You are the important ones. I'm here to support you with everything I've got. Let me help you move forward. Taken together, all the pieces of Clinton's announcement -- as well as the unconventional media she used to deliver them -- bring her back on stage not as a leader from yesterday but, surprisingly, as one for the future. Coincidentally, the way Marco Rubio announced his run for the Republican nomination most likely amplified the impact of Clinton's reframing. For all his posturing about being the new generation, Rubio followed to a \"T\" the most traditional script for announcing a candidacy: traditional stage and podium, dark suit, bright tie, wife and kids on camera, a live speech, all about himself, timed for the evening news. Rubio's logo, the signature of his image, drew immediate criticism for being amateurish and unconsidered, even leaving Alaska and Hawaii off the map of America. In stark contrast, Hillary showed the confidence and finesse to buck tradition on every front. It was Hillary who pulled the ultimate jiu-jitsu. There are those, of course, who will be alienated, if not disgusted, by the way her campaign has unfurled such a sophisticated marketing plan. In a day when voters are yearning for authenticity, how do we know this is the real Hillary or a candidate in a mask?  Fair question. But for better or worse, mass marketing has become the staple of presidential campaigns -- that's where most campaign dollars go. Both sides know how to play, sometimes brilliantly.  Remember the Reagan advertisements of 1984, proclaiming \"Morning in America\"? What we know is that over time, voters see a lot of unscripted moments of a candidate where the real character comes through. And if they spot hypocrisy between ads and the candidate, that campaign will get into trouble fast. That's why the key to Hillary Clinton's success in reframing her message and movement will be consistency.  She must not only take the essence of a humble, empathic relationship with voters and integrate it into all elements of her communication, she must also live it every day. Otherwise there will be messaging \"schizophrenia,\" the solid start with flashes of brilliance will peter out and she'll be facing the same voter perceptions that doomed her race in 2008. In the meantime, one can imagine Clinton getting a huge, satisfying belly laugh out of the early returns on her efforts.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 139 words:\nEvery morning, Sissa Abu Dahou puts on traditional male dress, known as a jalabiya, and heads into the streets of the Egyptian city of Luxor for a day of hard work. But this man of the house is actually a woman. The grandmother of two has dressed as a man for 43 years to avoid oppression and eek out a living in the conservative Muslim state. \"Why did you do this mother?\" her daughter asked during a recorded interview with Egyptian television network CBC. \"Your father died and I was six months pregnant with you.\" she replied. \"None of my siblings helped me. I raised you and sent you to school. Without money I could not have gotten you an education.\" A widow at just 21, Dahou was forced to fend for herself in Egypt's patriarchal south, where decades ago it was unheard of for women to earn their own living. Even in recent years, women make up barely 24% of Egypt's workforce, according to the World Bank. \"It is considered wrong that I dressed as a man but no one can judge. Not you or anyone else. Only God can judge me,\" Dahou said, \"People talked but I said I decided to be a man so I can take care of my small daughter.\" The breadwinner worked as a brick maker for just 25 piasters, the equivalent of a few cents, until she saved up enough money to buy a shoeshine kit.  She found a place for her wooden box, painted with red hearts and the Egyptian flag, alongside the all-male shoe shiners of her community. \"If it wasn't for my mother, I would have been on the streets\" Houda, her daughter, told TV host Mona al-Shazly through tears. \"Honestly I would have been in the streets. I did not find a home except with my mother. And even today my children rely on her.\" The years of sun and sand weathered and darkened Dahou's face and left her with a voice so deep and raspy she can easily be mistaken for a man. Her only child, Houda, eventually married and had two children of her own. Through the years the one-time housewife dreamed of owning her own business one day, a small street stand to sell snacks and cigarettes.  After her interview on CBC television, the governor of Luxor province offered Dahou a kiosk and a cash advance. The maverick had one requirement- she would only agree to meet with the governor in male attire. \"Even if I die, I will not take it off,\" Dahou said as she pulled on the male jalabiya in front of a TV camera, \"When I had to dress in a woman's jalabiya when I went to Cairo I felt suffocated. No, I thank God. I don't want anyone to look at me or look at my daughter.\" Now the 65-year-old who earned respect as a man has gained praise as a woman. Egypt's President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, crowned her as one of Egypt's ideal mothers in an official ceremony last month. \"If I was really a man, I would not have done this,\" Dahou told her daughter, \"I would have gotten remarried. I would have left you who knows where. You would have been treated without dignity or left homeless. Thank God I was able to protect you.\"\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "Sissa Abu Dahou, a 65-year-old Egyptian grandmother, has been dressing as a man for 43 years to survive in the conservative Muslim city of Luxor. Widowed at 21 with a young daughter to raise, she donned male attire to earn a living and provide for her family in a patriarchal society where women make up only 24% of the workforce. Dahou worked as a brick maker and later a shoeshiner, saving enough money to buy a kiosk where she now sells snacks and cigarettes. Despite facing societal stigma, she refused to reveal her true identity until a recent interview with Egyptian television network CBC. Moved by her story, the governor of Luxor offered her a permanent kiosk and a cash advance, which she accepted while wearing male attire. Egypt's President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, honored her as one of Egypt's ideal mothers. Dahou explained to her daughter, \"If I was really a man, I would not have done this. I would have gotten remarried and left you without dignity or homeless. Thank God I was able to protect you.\"",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nSo now the real trial is underway: What does the surviving Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, deserve and why?  What's he likely to get and why? Let's start where the penalty phase starts, with the prosecution's case. Prosecutors have listed, as they must, the aggravating circumstances that make this horrific mass murderer deserve the harshest punishment. The killing was \"heinous, cruel and depraved.\"   He placed a bomb in a crowd, set it to kill and maim children and adults indiscriminately -- if that's not heinous, cruel and depraved, what is? Cruelty classically consists of a desire to cause pain and suffering in innocent victims, or, at the opposite extreme, it reflects a cold, callous indifference. Tsarnaev displayed both. Cruelty really provides us a lens into the worst of the worst of the worst. The number of dead from the bombing (three) and injured (260), including dozens maimed, also elevate these murders.  The victims were vulnerable -- no one more so than 8-year-old Martin Richard.  For 2,500 years, we have proclaimed that all human beings are equally valuable, yet we identify certain victims as especially worthy, and those who prey on them as especially culpable. The prosecution's emphasis: The killings involved \"substantial planning and premeditation\" and a betrayal of the United States -- the very country that gave Tsarnaev shelter and citizenship. And then there's the selection of the site, the Boston Marathon, an \"iconic\" event. And then there's Tsarnaev's lack of remorse -- opening day, the prosecutor's final shot of Tsarnaev locked up, giving the security camera the finger.  From his blood-scrawled justification in the boat after the bombing to this day, the message has been: Screw you, society. Tsarnaev may take the stand to beg for mercy, but only if he now feels or at least can fake remorse. And don't confuse regret with remorse.  No doubt Tsarnaev regrets his present predicament, regrets the negative publicity he's brought his friends and family and most poignantly regrets running over and killing his older brother while trying to escape.  But that's a far cry from genuine remorse for the victims he's killed and maimed. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was the lesser of two evils, the defense will insist over and over. Tamerlan was the source of his younger brother's malicious intent.  As the prisoners inside Washington D.C.'s now defunct Lorton Central Prison once described the street code to me:  No snitching, but if someone dies, then \"the dead guy did everything.\" So the defense will claim that Dzhokhar was not fully responsible because he could not be.  After all, he was only 19.  Biologists teach us our brains don't fully develop until we're 25.  Thus, their argument goes, a 19-year-old simply can't be the worst of the worst. In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty for those younger than 18 when they killed, repeatedly quoting an article by psychologists Laurence Steinberg and Elizabeth Scott.  But in the same article, these leading developmental psychologists themselves characterized it as an \"open question whether under real-world conditions the decision making of mid-adolescents is truly comparable with that of adults.\" And they were talking about 17-year-olds. To the best of my knowledge, science has not and cannot establish a definitive connection between organic brain development and moral responsibility. Think about it:  When a 19-year-old bravely dashes into a burning building, risking his life to save children inside, we celebrate this heroism. We do not, nor should we, dismiss this bravery as the product of an impulsive not-yet-fully-formed personality.  If we can fully celebrate good character and heroic acts of our best young adults, why can't we fully condemn the cowardly viciousness of our worst? What outcome would I predict in the Tsarnaev case? Confronted by surviving victims and images of their dead loved ones, hearing offsetting pleas to \"move on,\" balancing the real suffering in the courtroom against the  imagined punishment of life that awaits Tsarnaev, I expect the jury will vote 10-2 (or 9-3) for death. But they must be unanimous for death; a lopsided but divided jury would result in a life sentence. Worse, the historical record and headlines in the next day's anti-death penalty news organizations will probably proclaim:  \"Jury Chooses Life for the Marathon Bomber\" -- even if overwhelmingly the people's representatives were to vote for death as the more appropriate punishment. Requiring a unanimous verdict for death gives the defense an enormous advantage -- one of many.  Why? Because in the end, we would much prefer that 1 or 10 or 20 convicted murderers who deserve to die instead live out their lives in the relatively nonpunitive condition of prison than one person who deserves to live be wrongly killed at the hands of the people. And yet, if we really commit ourselves to having the punishment fit the crime, if we rightly reserve the death penalty for the most heinous crimes and criminals, surely the Boston Marathon bomber stands among the worst of the worst.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "The Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is currently on trial for the 2005 Boston Marathon bombing that resulted in three deaths and 2005 injuries, including 176 people who were maimed. Prosecutors argue that Tsarnaev's actions were heinous, cruel, and depraved, as he placed bombs in a crowded area with the intention of killing and maiming innocent victims. Tsarnaev displayed both a desire to cause pain and suffering and a cold, callous indifference towards his victims. The prosecution emphasizes that the killings involved substantial planning and premeditation, a betrayal of the United States, and the selection of the iconic Boston Marathon as the site of the attack. Tsarnaev is unlikely to show genuine remorse for his actions, and the defense may argue that he was only 19 at the time of the crime and his brain was not fully developed. The defense may also claim that Tsarnaev was influenced by his older brother, Tamerlan. The jury must be unanimous in their decision for the death penalty, which gives the defense an advantage and may result in Tsarnaev receiving a life sentence instead.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 190 words:\nAfter deliberating for more than 35 hours over parts of seven days, listening intently to the testimony of more than 130 witnesses and reviewing more than 400 pieces of evidence, the teary-eyed men and women of the jury exchanged embraces. Since late January, their work in the Massachusetts murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez had consumed their lives. It was nothing like \"Law & Order.\" The days were long and tedious. Now it was over. \"It's been an incredibly emotional toll on all of us,\" Lesa Strachan told CNN's Anderson Cooper Thursday in the first nationally televised interview with members of the jury. A day earlier, Strachan, the jury foreperson, announced the first-degree murder conviction in the 2013 shooting death of Hernandez's onetime friend Odin Lloyd. Strachan said she was struck by the viciousness of multiple gunshots. \"You shot him once but you kept going and you shot him six times. There's no need for that and there's no need to use a gun. Period.\" Before the trial, at least one juror -- Rosalie Oliver -- hadn't heard of the 25-year-old defendant who has now gone from a $40 million pro-football contract to a term of life without parole in a maximum-security prison. But Kelly Dorsey watches the Patriots every Sunday during the football season. She said so on her jury questionnaire. \"I knew of him as a football player, not a person,\" she said. It didn't affect her vote to convict, she said. It didn't matter that he was a football player, she said. Nor did it matter whether he actually pulled the trigger in the murder. \"To leave your friend on the ground, knowing that he's not there anymore -- he's either dead or he's going to die -- that's indifference,\" Dorsey said of Hernandez. \"He didn't need to pull the trigger.\" That word -- \"indifference\" -- was used multiple times by members of the jury. Jon Carlson said he was struck by testimony and video evidence that Hernandez and two co-defendants were sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying, drinking smoothies. Hernandez at times left his then-8-month-old daughter with the two men. That indifference \"surprised a lot of us,\" Carlson said. He stressed the fact that Hernandez played football for a living didn't influence the jury's decision. \"It doesn't matter how much money you have or how much money you make. We're all people, and we're all equal, and we all deserve the same fair trial, and that's what we wanted to make sure we gave him,\" Carlson said. Lloyd was seen June 17, 2013, around 2:30 a.m. with Hernandez and Hernandez's friends, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, in a rented silver Nissan Altima. Later that day, a jogger found his body. He had been shot six times, according to prosecutors. Wallace and Ortiz, who were also charged with murder, have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. What's next for Aaron Hernandez? Rosalie Oliver -- the juror who hadn't heard of Hernandez before the trial -- said that, for her, the first shot was enough. \"There was no need for the other five,\" she said. \"One shot for me is cruelty.\" Oliver and other jurors said they were surprised to receive calls from friends congratulating them after the verdict. \"Who won?\" she asked \"Odin Lloyd didn't win. (His mother) didn't bring back her son. Did Mr. Hernandez win? No, because he's going to serve the rest of his life in jail and he's 25 years old. The worst part for me is: How about that little girl that's never going to see her father again?\" What prison life will be like for Aaron Hernandez. Oliver recalled making eye contact with Hernandez at one point during the months-long trial. \"He actually nodded to me one time,\" she said. \"You come in that room every day and you see this person and it's hard to come to that decision at the end because -- like three months with them -- it's almost like they're part of you. And then, all of a sudden now, you've got to make that decision to either put him away or let him go.\" The jurors declined to talk about the dynamics inside the jury room, choosing instead to keep the focus on the evidence presented during trial. They conveyed a sense of gravity about their task. \"You see, you know, 'Law & Order' and all these different TV shows and it's just nothing like that at all. It's just very serious,\" Carlson said. 5 things to know about the jury.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 134 words:\nLarry Johnson remembers the fear and feeling of helplessness from being on the SkyWest Airlines flight that made an emergency landing in Buffalo, New York. \"I thought we were done,\" he said Thursday, one day later. \"There was no doubt in my mind that we weren't going to land.\" Johnson was flying with his brother, his girlfriend and his 8-month-old son when he says a flight attendant came over the speaker asking for someone who was medically trained to help with a sick passenger. Minutes later, Johnson says, the attendant announced there was a pressurization problem and told passengers to prepare for the emergency landing. \"You're going to feel dizzy and woozy and lightheaded, and you're not going to be able to breathe,\" Johnson recalled the flight attendant saying. The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday initially reported a pressurization problem with SkyWest Flight 5622, and said it would investigate. It later issued a statement that did not reference any pressurization issues. \"It was like being trapped and you couldn't do anything. You have no control over it. Your body just felt pressured,\" Johnson said. Johnson said his girlfriend was seeing spots and that \"when I was blinking, it was really bright. I could barely see.\" According to Marissa Snow, spokeswoman for SkyWest, three passengers reported a loss of consciousness while on the flight. Fifteen passengers were examined by medical personnel at the Buffalo airport, but no one was transported to the hospital, she said. The spokeswoman said that maintenance personnel found no indication of a pressurization problem with the aircraft, an Embraer E170, and that the airline continues to investigate the cause. An official with the National Transportation Safety Board told CNN that the agency is in communication with the FAA and SkyWest to gather information on the incident to better understand what took place. Mary Cunningham was the nurse on board who attended to the first sick passenger. \"There was a woman, very lethargic, very nauseous, turning gray, just not looking good,\" Cunningham said. After administering oxygen to the woman, Cunningham, a nurse at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut, returned to her seat. Soon after, Cunningham said, she was called up again by the flight attendant after another women near the first started to lose consciousness. \"It was something that was affecting oxygen in that area,\" which was near the middle of the plane, she said. Cunningham said she had to return to her seat after feeling lightheaded. There were 84 passengers on board the plane, including nine crew members. Flight 5622 was originally scheduled to fly from Chicago to Hartford, Connecticut. The plane descended 28,000 feet in three minutes. \"It would feel like a roller coaster -- when you're coming over the top and you're going down,\" CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said, describing how such a descent would feel. \"You know that these pilots knew they were in a very grave and very serious situation.\" Johnson, flying to visit his parents with their only grandchild, was glad that roller coaster ride ended safely. \"It was a shaky ride. It wasn't anything I would like to experience again,\" he said. CNN's Jean Casarez, Josh Gaynor, Dana Ford and Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 168 words:\nGiovanni Lo Porto put himself in harm's way to help, heading to Pakistan to work on a much needed reconstruction project following deadly flooding there. His work and his life, as he knew it then, came to a halt on January 19, 2012. That's when, according to Italy's state-run ANSA news agency, four armed men burst into the building where Lo Porto lived and abducted him along with colleague Bernd Muehlenbeck. Two years later, Lo Porto was dead -- killed accidentally by a U.S. drone strike, according to American authorities. The native of the Sicilian city of Palermo died along with a fellow al Qaeda hostage, American Warren Weinstein. That same counterterrorism operation in a border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan killed at least one al Qaeda leader, Ahmed Farouq, who was also a U.S. citizen. His family members, including his four brothers, called him Giancarlo. Lo Porto grew up in Sicily and then studied at London Metropolitan University, getting his undergraduate degree there in Peace and Conflict Studies in 2010, according to the school. A professor there remembers him as \"passionate, friendly (and) open-minded,\" according to an ANSA report. And the university, in a statement, described him as \"a popular student who was committed to helping others.\" \"We are tremendously proud of him and the humanitarian work he did,\" the school said. At the time he was taken captive, Lo Porto worked with the German aid organization Welthungerlife, a 53-year-old group dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty worldwide. Such work means going to places where the need is most -- places like Multan in Pakistan. That community was one of many in Pakistan devastated by major flooding in 2010, which covered about one-fifth of the country and left more than 1,500 people dead. These conditions are all too common in the South Asian nation, as evidenced by flooding one year later that forced upwards of 660,000 into refugee camps and killed more than 430 people, about a quarter of whom were children. \"He told me, 'I'm pleased to have returned to Asia and Pakistan, I love the people, culture and food in this part of the world,' \" said the London Metropolitan University professor. Specifically, Lo Porto was a project manager with Welthungerlife's clean water and sanitation program, working with 8 to 10 fellow international staffers and 100 to 200 locals starting in October 2011, according to Simone Pott, a spokeswoman for the aid group. Pott described Lo Porto as a lively, very positive man who made friends all over the world. Some of those friends in Italy, England and beyond pressed for Lo Porto's release after he was taken captive, urging Italy's government and newspaper editors to get his story out, ANSA reported. The same story said that al Qaeda (after first claiming he was being held) denied abducting Lo Porto, as did the Pakistani Taliban. Muehlenbeck, a German national, was freed last October, at which time he said that he and his colleague had been separated, according to ANSA. But Lo Porto never got the chance to savor freedom again, like his German counterpart. Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said his country's government \"carried out every effort possible to trace and try to return Giovanni to his loved ones.\" \"Unfortunately, the conclusion is now different (than we wanted) because of the tragic and fatal mistake of our American allies, which has been recognized by President Obama,\" Gentiloni said. \"The responsibility of his death and (that) of Warren Weinstein ... is that of the terrorists.\" On Thursday, after the U.S. government reported Lo Porto's death, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi expressed his \"deepest sorrow for the death of an Italian who dedicated his life to the service of others.\" Lo Porto's death left those at his former charity Welthungerlife speechless and confused, Pott said. And then there are his family members like his mother, who ANSA reports became \"another person\" after her son's kidnapping. \"Her only hope was to embrace Giovanni,\" a neighbor said. CNN's Hadia Messia contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

On Thursday night's \"Grey's Anatomy,\" Dr. Derek Shepherd -- the hunky character played by Patrick Dempsey -- died. He wasn't shot down over the Sea of Japan, nor did a helicopter fall on his head. Instead, he died following a car crash -- after helping victims of another accident. \"Derek Shepherd is and will always be an incredibly important character -- for Meredith (Grey), for me and for the fans,\" show creator Shonda Rhimes said in a statement, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \"I absolutely never imagined saying goodbye to our 'McDreamy.' Patrick Dempsey's performance shaped Derek in a way that I know we both hope became a meaningful example -- happy, sad, romantic, painful and always true -- of what young women should demand from modern love. His loss will be felt by all.\" Intriguingly, Dempsey still has a year left on his contract. His character's death leaves his TV wife, Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), as the show's mainstay as it concludes its 11th season in May. \"It's been a remarkable ride,\" Dempsey told TVLine. \"The worldwide impact has been extraordinary. It is incredible how devoted and passionate the fans are, and I will forever be grateful and humbled by the experience.\" \"Grey's\" fans are still in shock. People magazine ran an obituary for the character. #McDreamyForever was a trending hashtag on Twitter. Tweets from \"Grey's Anatomy's\" official account were filled with emoji of crying faces and broken hearts, as well as tearful images from the show. Some chose to remember the good times, but for others, there was a big sense of betrayal. But the show will very much continue -- not only does it have a few weeks before the 11th season is over, Pompeo is also signed through season 12. The theme of this season, Rhimes had said, was Grey's ability to stand on her own. Now without her husband -- who was already devoting his life to separate concerns as a presidential aide -- she'll truly have to do so. \"Grey's Anatomy,\" though not the powerhouse it was when it premiered in 2005, still does well in the ratings. For the week ending April 19, the most recent available, it was 20th in overall viewers and 12th among the desirable adults 18-49 demographic. And Dempsey, who also races cars, isn't going anywhere. He has a development deal with ABC Studios, \"Grey's\" producers.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 172 words:\nIslamabad, Pakistan (CNN)Her second floor cafe on a dusty industrial road was painted with dashes of psychedelic colors.  And Sabeen Mahmud surrounded herself there with books, people, and discussions on technology, human rights and women's entrepreneurship. Introducing others to Jimi Hendrix, street art, and talking politics was not supposed to get her killed. But in Pakistan, free speech is dangerous, and Mahmud's exuberant exercise of it made her stick out nationwide. Two gunman shot her dead at point-blank range late Friday after she locked up The Second Floor cafe in Karachi for the night, police said. Mahmud died from five bullet wounds. The gunmen also shot her mother. She is in a hospital but is expected to be released on time for her daughter's funeral. Mahmud's killing broke hearts beating for non-violence and progressive values across the country. She freely said what she thought in a place where many people are too afraid to and by doing so spoke for many more people than just herself. She had become a Pakistani figurehead for humanism, love and tolerance. \"She took that torch into the dark forest and so many people followed. She really, truly was a success story of the heart,\" said close friend and BBC journalist Ziad Zafar. No one has claimed responsibility for her shooting, and police have not named any motive. But Mahmud had just finished leading a discussion group on a topic that many want silenced, when the shots fell. In the province of Baluchistan, where separatists have fought a virulent insurgency for years, people have been disappearing regularly. There have been steady allegations of mass abduction. The Lahore University of Management Sciences planned to host the discussion on the topic, with human rights activist Mama Qadeer Baloch, but authorities shut it down. Mahmud would not hear of it not going on. \"Despite the plurality of opinion, very little space seems to be given to the discussion in Pakistani mainstream media or academia; the debate seems to be shut down before it can even begin,\" she posted on Facebook. \"What is the reality? Has the media been silenced on Balochistan? What makes it dangerous for us to talk about Pakistan's largest province at one of our most celebrated universities?\" She invited the discussion to The Second Floor, also known by the shorthand T2F.  She said she knew it was a potentially dangerous move, and she had received death threats in the past when she handled the topic before. \"She was the bravest woman in the world, she really was, she was a brave heart; my God, she was a brave, brave girl,\" Zafar said. Even in its secluded, humble location, T2F was a magnet to those seeking secular wisdom. They found it in a homey setting, musingly decorated like a small town college bookstore. The walls outside its entrance are sprayed with socially critical graffiti -- dusky red hearts float across gray walls. Mahmud waited to greet visitors, many of them young Pakistanis seeking freedom of thought, with a hug, a mug and encouragement for Pakistan's future. \"She hoped the same thing we all hoped for, a place that is fair with liberty and justice for all,\" Zafar said. Grief over her death and gratefulness for her work poured out on social media and via email. \"Thanks for giving us the room to breathe when fog pressed heavy on our shoulders. It's only been a few hours, Sabeen, and the city is already gasping for air,\" a group of illustrators called From Karachi with Love wrote. An artist drew Mahmud puttering off on a Vespa scooter wearing pants, a blouse and sandals. Her tightly coiffed short hair and angular glasses framed her bright-eyed features. Missing was a head scarf. On a wall in T2F is a spray painted Technicolor image of Marilyn Monroe from \"the Seven Year Itch,\" her white dress replaced by a traditional outfit of mustard, ocher and  green. But it still flew up over her hips, revealing her alabaster legs, a daringly sexy and satirical image. The artistic expression sticks out and triggers passions, like many things Mahmud said and did.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 193 words:\nWe want our killers to be kind. To walk into court and show remorse, tell us that they are really nice people who only did it because they feared for their lives, or they were temporarily insane. Even though those things may not be true, too often they are accepted as legitimate excuses for murder. Well, Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end and now convicted murderer, made none of those excuses. He walked into court with an air of bravado, his head held high like the $40 million, NFL superstar he was just a couple of years ago. Several times he was even caught winking at his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, during the trial. And we didn't like his swagger. Hernandez didn't offer a plausible alibi. He didn't look ashamed or remorseful. He never wept. His own attorney, James Sultan, admitted that Hernandez \"witnessed\" the killing of Odin Lloyd, \"committed by somebody he knew,\" but said his client did not commit the crime. Even before the guilty verdict came down Wednesday, for many -- at least those covering the trial -- audacity seemed to be the defendant's biggest crime. \"The Arrogance of Aaron Hernandez,\" a New Yorker headline accused. I don't get it. What does it matter that Hernandez was arrogant in court, or walked with too much swagger, or even smiled at his girl? Like it or not, that is who he is. The evidence is what matters. And for once, this time it appears the jury carefully considered the damning mountain of circumstantial evidence against this defendant and came to the right decision: guilty of first-degree murder in the 2013 slaying of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, 25, was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. He was also found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition. It was the right decision. Still, it's hard not to feel sadness over such a senseless waste of life for both Lloyd and now Hernandez, who were once friends. Football was the best thing Hernandez ever had, especially after he father died suddenly after a routine hernia surgery in 2006. Hernandez was 16. After that his life got complicated. At 17, Hernandez went off to the University of Florida and seemed headed for greatness. There he won the John Mackey Award as the nation's best tight end and led the team in receiving during its 2009 Bowl Championship Series win. But off the field, his life was to beginning to unravel. Trouble started: bar fights, reports of marijuana use and failed drug tests. He was even questioned in relation to a shooting after a fight at a Gainesville, Florida, nightclub. By the time he was drafted in 2010 by the New England Patriots, Hernandez had already been labeled a \"troubled player.\" But neither the Patriots nor the NFL has anything to be ashamed of in how they handled the Hernandez case. They did everything right this time. Hours after Hernandez was charged with murder, he was let go from the team. And his coaches didn't spend any time trying to convince the public that their star tight end was a decent, family-loving guy, as the league has done too many times in the past when its players got in trouble. This time justice worked. There's no reason to second-guess what went wrong, to ask \"How could a star NFLer be a murderer?\" The NFL for the most part does a great job vetting its players, and certainly Hernandez is an anomaly in the league, where despite the ugly headlines, the overwhelming majority of players are upstanding, law-abiding citizens. And Patriots bashers (me included) would be mistaken to try to find fault with the team for drafting Hernandez despite his troubled past. No one really knows what evil lurks in the hearts of others, even those closest to us. Not the mothers whose sons go off and commit schoolyard killing sprees, or wives whose husbands gun down innocent people, and certainly not employers who are mostly concerned about performance on the job. There was no way to predict Hernandez would end up a murderer. He was a guy who had all the talent and opportunity in the world, but he still went wrong. Hernandez himself may have explained it best as he was being taken out of the courtroom:. According to a law enforcement source close to the case, Hernandez told officers escorting him, \"'Hey man, I'm going to miss you guys. ... I don't need any luck any more.' He gave you the impression, 'It's kinda like no big deal. ... It is what it is.' \"\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end, was convicted of first-degree murder in the 250-word news article. Despite the lack of remorse or plausible alibi, Hernandez maintained his composure during the trial, even winking at his fiancée. His arrogance and swagger were criticized, but the evidence, including circumstantial evidence, was the focus. Hernandez, 25, was sentenced to life without parole for the 17-year-old Odin Lloyd's murder in 173 words. He was also found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. Hernandez's life began to unravel after his father's sudden death in 167 words. Trouble started in college, including bar fights, marijuana use, and failed drug tests. Despite his troubled past, the Patriots did the right thing by releasing him hours after his arrest. The NFL did not attempt to defend Hernandez's character, unlike in past cases. Hernandez, who had all the talent and opportunity in the world, still went wrong, according to a law enforcement source. He told officers, \"It's kinda like no big deal. ... It is what it is.\"",

Trey -- a star on Eastern High School's basketball team in Louisville, Kentucky, who's headed to play college ball next year at Ball State -- was originally going to take his girlfriend to Eastern's prom. So why is he taking Ellie instead? \"She's great... she listens and she's easy to talk to\" he said. Trey made the prom-posal (yes, that's what they are calling invites to prom these days) in the gym during Ellie's P.E. class. Trina Helson, a teacher at Eastern, alerted the school's newspaper staff to the prom-posal and posted photos of Trey and Ellie on Twitter that have gone viral. She wasn't surpristed by Trey's actions. \"That's the kind of person Trey is,\" she said. To help make sure she said yes, Trey entered the gym armed with flowers and a poster that read \"Let's Party Like it's 1989,\" a reference to the latest album by Taylor Swift, Ellie's favorite singer. Trey also got the OK from Ellie's parents the night before via text. They were thrilled. \"You just feel numb to those moments raising a special needs child,\"  said Darla Meredith, Ellie's mom. \"You first feel the need to protect and then to overprotect.\" Darla Meredith said Ellie has struggled with friendships since elementary school, but a special program at Eastern called Best Buddies had made things easier for her. She said Best Buddies cultivates friendships between students with and without developmental disabilities and prevents students like Ellie from feeling isolated and left out of social functions. \"I guess around middle school is when kids started to care about what others thought,\" she said, but \"this school, this year has been a relief.\" Trey's future coach at Ball State, James Whitford, said he felt great about the prom-posal, noting that Trey, whom he's known for a long time, often works with other kids. Trey's mother, Shelly Moses, was also proud of her son. \"It's exciting to bring awareness to a good cause,\" she said. \"Trey has worked pretty hard, and he's a good son.\" Both Trey and Ellie have a lot of planning to do. Trey is looking to take up special education as a college major, in addition to playing basketball in the fall. As for Ellie, she can't stop thinking about prom. \"Ellie can't wait to go dress shopping\" her mother said. \"Because I've only told about a million people!\" Ellie interjected.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nNorfolk, Virginia (CNN)The second mate of the Houston Express probably couldn't believe what he was seeing. Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. At first it looked abandoned. It was in bad shape, listing to one side. The crew of the 1,000-foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. Incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. \"He was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition,\" Capt. Thomas Grenz told CNN by phone Friday. That man, Louis Jordan, 37, had an amazing story. He'd been drifting on the 35-foot Pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving Conway, South Carolina, to fish in the ocean. Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn't fix the boat right away. Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. \"It took so long,\" Jordan said.  \"It moved so slowly.\" The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. His father, Frank Jordan, told CNN's Jim Sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different. \"He looked good. Hadn't lost too much weight. He wasn't badly sunburned like I thought he probably would be,\" he said. Lost at sea for 66 days. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the Carolinas during the time he was missing. The precipitation came at night during harsh conditions. \"I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,\" Jordan said.  \"The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. \"Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket.\" Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jordan came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital about 7:30 p.m. Coast Guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt Jordan's incredible story. They noted that his father contacted them January 29 to report his son and his boat missing. Frank Jordan addressed the skepticism about his son's appearance, saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time. His son spent most of his days in the cabin, out of the sun. Frank Jordan said it was obvious when the Jordans met at the hospital Friday morning that his normally low-key and private son had been through an ordeal. \"I know he went through what he went through,\" Frank Jordan said. Jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in Conway. He had free rent and free food in the river, he said. But when it became difficult to catch dinner, he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. \"He's got a very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,\" Frank Jordan said. \"And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal.\" Rescue swimmer Kyle McCollum was the first to care for Jordan on the flight back to land. \"You would expect sunburns, severe sunburn, blisters maybe ... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him,\" he said. \"But for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing.\" Grenz was also surprised by Jordan's condition, physically and mentally. The rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was, remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days. Jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry. \"We took him to a rescue boat,\" the container ship captain said. \"He was given water and pea soup to gain some power again.\" Derriel Morris, a neighbor at the Bucksport Plantation Marina & RV Resort called Jordan a nice guy who loved his 47-year-old boat, named \"Angel.\" Morris said: \"It was immaculate, it was gorgeous, beautifully painted. I mean it looked like a brand new sailboat.\" Morris told CNN affiliate WPDE that one day in January he was going to the store and Jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer. But when he returned to the marina, Jordan had slipped away. \"There was no shore line, no hose; it was like he was never there,\" Morris told the station. After he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony. The marina's manager, Jeff Weeks, told WPDE that Jordan is expected to be back at Buscksport next week. Tales of people who cheated death after days, weeks adrift.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "A man named Louis Jordan, 37, was rescued after drifting at sea for 29 days on a 25-foot sailboat named \"Angel\" off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia. The second mate of the container ship, Houston Express, discovered Jordan's boat, which was in bad shape and listing to one side, with Jordan signaling for help. Jordan had left Conway, South Carolina, two months prior to fish in the ocean but encountered a storm that capsized his boat and broke his shoulder. He was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but progress was slow due to strong currents and numerous storms. Jordan survived by collecting rainwater and catching fish that were attracted to his laundry. His father, Frank Jordan, was skeptical about his son's appearance but was relieved to find him in good condition upon their reunion at the hospital. Jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in Conway. The marina community held a candlelight ceremony when he went missing, and he is expected to return there upon his release from the hospital. Coast Guard officials have confirmed Jordan's story, noting that his father reported him missing on January 29.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 185 words:\nOn May 28, 2014, some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. But they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event. Instead, the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits. Armed soldiers guarded the exits. In the patently unfair, open air trial that followed, 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed. Three were sentenced to death. The public mass sentencing was part a China's \"Strike Hard\" campaign against unrest in Xinjiang, a campaign the government claims was launched to combat \"terrorism\" and \"separatism.\" But it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Today, Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide.  Much of it makes for grim reading. In Pakistan, the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows.  Iran and Iraq executed people for \"terrorism,\" and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes. In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before, governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism. Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates. Jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in December, putting 11 murder convicts to death, with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime.  In Indonesia, authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety \"national emergency.\" Six people have already been executed this year. A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool.  The rise was largely because of developments in Egypt and Nigeria, where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict. The simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both. There is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence, as United Nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed. It is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough. At Amnesty International, we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades. Thankfully, most of the world now appears to agree with us. The numbers speak for themselves. In 1945 when the United Nations was founded, only eight countries had abolished the death penalty. Today, 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice. Last year, we recorded executions in 22 countries, down by almost a half from 20 years ago. Despite the troubling developments we recorded last year, there was still much good news to be found. The number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year, from 778 to 607. This number does not include China, where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together, but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret, the true figure is impossible to determine. Executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Equatorial Guinea, Somalia and Sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter. The Americas continued to be execution-free, apart from the United States. Those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history. They must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment. Fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task, but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment. With determination, I know that we can achieve this goal.\n\noutput:",

Threes were sentenced to death as part of China's \"Strike Hard\" campaign against unrest. Amnesty International's 607-word annual report reveals that in 607 countries, including Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq, governments used the death penalty to tackle crime and terrorism.

The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting \"We are not afraid. We stand together,\"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. \"You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' \" Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a \"cowardly act.\" \"To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,\" Larry Moneta said Wednesday.

A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. \"Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,\" Mellado said, according to WSU News. \"She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life.\" Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog's treatment, but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care. She's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target, inspired by Theia's tale of survival against the odds. On the fundraising page, Mellado writes, \"She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw. I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home.\" She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs, Mellado adds, and wants to \"make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!\" Any additional funds raised will be \"paid forward\" to help other animals. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in Tampa, Florida, found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society.\n\noutput:",

Three days later, she managed to crawl to a nearby farm and was taken to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at Washington State University for care. Theia, a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix, suffered from dislocated jaw, leg injuries, and a caved-in sinus cavity. She requires surgery to help her breathe and has set up a fundraising page for her medical expenses, which have already surpassed the $10,000 target. A cat in Tampa, Florida, also survived after being buried by its owner five days after being hit by a car. Both animals have defied the odds and continue to receive care and support from their rescuers.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 175 words:\nIf you've been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \"Long live Zarif,\" crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \"polished\" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \"jovial.\" An Internet search for \"Mohammad Javad Zarif\" and \"jovial\" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six:. In September 2013, Zarif tweeted \"Happy Rosh Hashanah,\" referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: \"Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir.\" And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. \"Iran never denied it,\" Zarif tweeted back. \"The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\" The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that \"due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.\" That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was \"born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.\" Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961. So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled \"Mr. Ambassador\" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 155 words:\nWashington (CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the deal six world powers struck to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions, saying he sees better options than \"this bad deal or war.\" \"I think there's a third alternative, and that is standing firm, ratcheting up the pressure until you get a better deal,\" Netanyahu told CNN's Jim Acosta Sunday on \"State of the Union.\" His comments come as Democrats and Republicans spar over the framework announced last week to lift Western sanctions on Iran in exchange for the country dropping from 19,000 to 5,060 active centrifuges, limiting its highly enriched uranium, and increasing inspections. President Barack Obama endorsed the deal, saying it was better than the alternatives. But GOP contenders for the party's 2016 presidential nomination lambasted it, saying it gave Iran too much flexibility. On Sunday, the sparring continued. One Senate Democrat said Netanyahu needs to \"contain himself.\" And a top Republican said almost any of Obama's successors as president \"could do better.\" Netanyahu's most recent argument against the Iran nuclear deal was similar to the one he'd made in a March trip to Washington, when he addressed a joint session of Congress -- fueling a Republican push to have the deal sent to Congress before it's implemented. \"It does not roll back Iran's nuclear program. It keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place. Not a single centrifuge is destroyed. Not a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that they built illicitly. Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium,\" Netanyahu said Sunday. \"That's a very bad deal. \" Netanyahu said Iran is a country of \"congenital cheating\" and that it can't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal, which lasts 10 years with some provisions extending well beyond that. He said his opposition has little to do with his frosty relationship with Obama. \"I think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this, because I think Iran has shown to be completely distrustful,\" Netanyahu said. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, meanwhile, said she wishes Netanyahu \"would contain himself.\" The top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said negotiators working on the deal -- from Iran and the United States, as well as Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- are \"on the cusp of something that can be workable.\" \"It's a framework. It has to be wrapped into a final agreement. There still can be some changes,\" Feinstein said. \"But I don't think it's helpful for Israel to come out and oppose this one opportunity to change a major dynamic -- which is downhill, a downhill dynamic in this part of the world.\" Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz defended the deal in an appearance on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, saying it would extend from two months to one year the \"breakout\" time period -- the length of time it would take Iran to build a nuclear bomb. He said it also allows for the \"almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal.\" \"We have blocked all of these pathways to a bomb,\" he said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said on \"Face the Nation\" that the best option for the United States is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a \"new crack at it with a new president that doesn't have the baggage of Obama.\" And he said the alternatives to Obama on both sides -- with the exception of Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who's called for a less active U.S. role overseas -- would likely strike a better deal. \"Hillary Clinton would do better. I think everybody on our side, except, maybe, Rand Paul, could do better,\" Graham said.\n\noutput:",

Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told CNN that \"so far no videos were used in the crash investigation.\" He added, \"A person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators.\" Robin's comments follow claims by two magazines, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board Germanwings Flight 9525 as it crashed into the French Alps. All 150 on board were killed. Paris Match and Bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site. The two publications described the supposed video, but did not post it on their websites. The publications said that they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation. \"One can hear cries of 'My God' in several languages,\" Paris Match reported. \"Metallic banging can also be heard more than three times, perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object.  Towards the end, after a heavy shake, stronger than the others, the screaming intensifies. Then nothing.\" \"It is a very disturbing scene,\" said Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Bild online. An official with France's accident investigation agency, the BEA, said the agency is not aware of any such video. Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini, a French Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the Germanwings crash site, told CNN that the reports were \"completely wrong\" and \"unwarranted.\" Cell phones have been collected at the site, he said, but that they \"hadn't been exploited yet.\" Menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the Criminal Research Institute in Rosny sous-Bois, near Paris, in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators. But none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute, Menichini said. Asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media, Menichini answered with a categorical \"no.\" Reichelt told \"Erin Burnett: Outfront\" that he had watched the video and stood by the report, saying Bild and Paris Match are \"very confident\" that the clip is real. He noted that investigators only revealed they'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after Bild and Paris Match published their reports. \"That is something we did not know before. ... Overall we can say many things of the investigation weren't revealed by the investigation at the beginning,\" he said. What was mental state of Germanwings co-pilot? German airline Lufthansa confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525, which he's accused of deliberately crashing last week in the French Alps. Lubitz told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a \"previous episode of severe depression,\" the airline said Tuesday. Email correspondence between Lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation, Lufthansa said, included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training. The announcement indicates that Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, knew of Lubitz's battle with depression, allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit. Lufthansa, whose CEO Carsten Spohr previously said Lubitz was 100% fit to fly, described its statement Tuesday as a \"swift and seamless clarification\" and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors. Spohr traveled to the crash site Wednesday, where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside. He saw the crisis center set up in Seyne-les-Alpes, laid a wreath in the village of Le Vernet, closer to the crash site, where grieving families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial. Menichini told CNN late Tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching. French President Francois Hollande, speaking Tuesday, said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using DNA analysis by the end of the week, sooner than authorities had previously suggested. In the meantime, the recovery of the victims' personal belongings will start Wednesday, Menichini said. Among those personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the 144 passengers and six crew on board. Check out the latest from our correspondents. The details about Lubitz's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and Lubitz's possible motive for downing the jet. A Lufthansa spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday that Lubitz had a valid medical certificate, had passed all his examinations and \"held all the licenses required.\" Earlier, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Dusseldorf, Christoph Kumpa, said medical records reveal Lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot's license. Kumpa emphasized there's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash. Investigators are looking into whether Lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license, a European government official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Tuesday. While flying was \"a big part of his life,\" the source said, it's only one theory being considered. Another source, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, also told CNN that authorities believe the primary motive for Lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems. Lubitz's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist, both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues, the European government official said. But no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles, there's more to the story, said Brian Russell, a forensic psychologist. \"Psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they weren't going to keep doing their job and they're upset about that and so they're suicidal,\" he said. \"But there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person's problems.\" Germanwings crash compensation: What we know.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 181 words:\nThe FBI has confirmed that one of its most wanted terrorists, the Malaysian bomb maker known as Marwan, was killed in an otherwise disastrous raid in the Philippines in January. Marwan, whose real name is Zulkifli bin Hir, was believed by the FBI to a member of southeast Asian terror group Jemaah Islamiyah's central command. The FBI said in February that a DNA sample -- understood to be from a severed finger -- taken from a man killed in a raid in the southern Philippines showed a link with a known relative of Marwan. But the FBI now says tests have confirmed that the dead man was the wanted Islamic extremist. \"After a thorough review of forensic data and information obtained from our Philippine law enforcement partners, the FBI has assessed that terrorism subject, Zulkifli Abdhir ... is deceased and has been removed from the FBI's list of Most Wanted Terrorists,\" David Bowdich, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, told CNN in a statement. The FBI had been offering a $5 million reward for information leading to Marwan's capture in the wake of his 2007 indictment on terror charges in a California court. It accused him of being a supplier of IEDs to terrorist organizations, and having conducted bomb making training for terror groups, including the Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf. Marwan had previously been falsely reported dead after a raid by Philippine security forces in 2012. The Philippines has been fighting an insurgency in the predominantly Muslim south for years, and last year signed a peace agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the largest rebel group in the region. But in January it launched a surprise raid in pursuit of Marwan at Mamapasono, in the southern province of Maguindanao. The mission went disastrously awry. Forty-four members of the police's elite Special Action Force (SAF) unit were killed in the assault, targeting an area controlled by the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) -- a hardline splinter group which has rejected the peace deal with the Philippines government. According to a report released by the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) last month, the BIFF faction sheltering Marwan had sworn allegiance to ISIS. In the immediate aftermath of the assault, the SAF company charged with executing Marwan came under fire, before another SAF company stationed in nearby MILF territory as a \"blocking force\" became engaged in an eight-hour firefight with MILF fighters. According to the IPAC report, the SAF \"blocking\" company eventually ran out of ammunition and only one of their number survived,. Eighteen MILF fighters were killed and a number of BIFF fighters may also died. The clash shattered a three-year ceasefire with the MILF, authorities said. A national day of mourning was declared as the men were laid to rest. Bowdich expressed the FBI's \"sincere condolences to the brave officers of the Special Action Force who lost their lives while attempting to apprehend this dangerous fugitive.\" While an SAF superintendent said at a eulogy for the fallen commandos that their sacrifice had been worth it, controversy has dogged the botched mission in the Philippines. The IPAC report argued that the \"single-minded focus\" of authorities on killing Marwan has threatened the peace agreement with the MILF, which is yet to cross the final hurdle of being passed into law by the Philippines Congress. \"The best chance the southern Philippines has ever had for peace may now be in jeopardy,\" read the report, which argued that the Mamapasano fiasco was the result of a misguided emphasis on killing Marwan. The report argued that, although Marwan had aided terror attacks and provided funds and equipment to MILF and Abu Sayyaf, he was not \"the master bomber that his reputation suggested.\" Yet for the Philippines authorities and their U.S. allies, killing Marwan had become such a priority that security forces bypassed the mechanisms that had been established to alert the MILF to such operations, for fear of word leaking to their target. The report quoted an anonymous Indonesian associate of Marwan's who described the Malaysian as \"a little snake who has been blown up into a dragon.\" READ MORE: Dozens of Philippine police killed in raid on 'high value' bomb makers.

No other cars were involved in the crash, which occurred shortly before midnight. \"He was not restrained at the time of the crash,\" Tallent told CNN. The musician lived in northern Georgia. Burns was part of the genre-defining band's original lineup, which formed in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1965. Lead singer Ronnie Van Zant started Noble Five with Burns, guitarists Gary Rossington and Allen Collins and bassist Larry Junstrom in their hometown. It then made a name change in a reference to a high school gym teacher. Lynyrd Skynyrd changed members over the years as it produced rock anthems including \"Sweet Home Alabama\" and \"Freebird.\" Burns left the band before its third studio album, \"Nuthin Fancy,\" in 1975, \"exhausted by touring,\" according to the band's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame biography. He was not involved in the 1977 plane crash that killed three members, including Van Zant. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Lynyrd Skynyrd still tours with Rossington, the only original member still in the band. \"Today I'm at a loss for words but I just remember Bob being a funny guy,\" Rossington said on the band's official Facebook page. \"My heart goes out to his family and God bless him and them in this sad time.

He encapsulated the frustration and grief caused by a New York grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of a black man with a simple tweet: \"This one was on film.\" Now, he's stirring things up again with a series of tweets documenting three traffic stops in seven weeks. \"Stopped by the cops again wish me luck,\" he posted early Tuesday, along with a photo showing him behind the wheel of a car with what looks like blue police lights in the background. He posted similar photos in February. Many African-Americans have long bemoaned the phenomenon of being pulled over for no apparent reason, calling it \"driving while black.\" Blacks are about 30% more likely to be pulled over by police than whites, according to figures reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2013. And in amid increased conversation over race and policing after the high-profile deaths last year of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the issue is even more sensitive. Rock hasn't commented on the tweets and didn't say how the police stop turned out. He got lots of support on Twitter. \"My heart legit dropped, no kidding,\" one Twitter fan posted. Many praised him for documenting the stops. Some accused him of race-baiting. But one bit of advice in particular lit up social media. Actor Isaiah Washington urged Rock to \"#Adapt\" to avoid racial profiling. \"I sold my $90,000.00 Mercedes G500 and bought 3 Prius's, because I got tired of being pulled over by Police,\" Washington tweeted. Some saw that as a sell-out, saying Rock shouldn't have to take steps others might not have to as a way to avoid being pulled over. \"Let me guess..you also make sure your pants are pulled up as well?.\" Twitter user YeshaCallahan posted. Appearing on CNN, Washington defended the tweet, saying he wanted to \"excite a conversation.\" Years ago, Rock filmed a sketch for his \"Chris Rock\" show on HBO in which he detailed ways to avoid being beaten by police as a black man. Besides obeying the law, he suggested bringing a white friend along for the ride. He did just that last year in a segment of \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\" with Jerry Seinfeld. The two chat as Seinfeld drives an orange Lamborghini. And what happened? They get pulled over after Seinfeld goes a bit heavy on the gas. \"Here's the crazy thing,\" Rock tells Seinfeld as the police officer stops the duo. \"If you weren't here, I'd be scared.\"\n\noutput:",

After deliberating for 11½ hours, jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on Wednesday of all 30 counts he faced in the Boston Marathon bombing trial. Seventeen of the 30 counts were capital charges, meaning he is eligible for the death penalty. The trial will next move into a penalty phase, where the jury will hear testimony and arguments from both sides and ultimately be tasked with deciding whether Tsarnaev, 21, will be executed. A look at all of the charges. Jurors will be asked to weigh aggravating factors such as the heinousness of his crimes against mitigating factors such as his family and mental health history, as well as his relative youth. Tsarnaev was 19 at the time of the bombing. The start date of the penalty phase has not yet been set. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. \"He was there,\" Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but many say the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. Tsarnaev lawyer keeps hated criminals off death row. Clarke tried to convince jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. After the verdict, CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said Clarke now faces an uphill battle. \"Because No. 1, he (Tsarnaev) is almost functioning as an officer of a military organization attacking the United States -- the claim of course that he's an Islamic radical and that this is almost an army-like attack on civilians. \"And the second thing -- it was so well planned and so callously planned so that civilians would die, so that children would be maimed. And all of this, she has to get around and convince the jury he's not worthy of the death penalty. \"Boy, she's climbing the Mount Everest of death penalty cases in this case,\" Callan said about Clarke. Survivors react to the verdict. Ann O'Neill reported from Boston. Dana Ford reported from Atlanta.\n\noutput:",

In 1990, he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, finishing 17th. The following year he released an album titled \"I Made a Vow,\" which catapulted him to prominence. Though he recorded nearly 20 albums, that one would remain his most popular. His final album was released in 2007. Other artists recorded his material throughout his career. Videos available online show a vibrant performer with a thick shock of dark hair as he accompanies himself on guitar and croons in a clear tenor. Kayahan was best known for his love songs.

Most of the penalty amounts to forced spending on improving pipeline safety. Of the $1.6 billion, $850 million will go to \"gas transmission pipeline safety infrastructure improvements,\" the commission said. Another $50 million will go toward \"other remedies to enhance pipeline safety,\" according to the commission. \"PG&E failed to uphold the public's trust,\" commission President Michael Picker said. \"The CPUC failed to keep vigilant. Lives were lost. Numerous people were injured. Homes were destroyed. We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again.\" The company's chief executive officer said in a written statement that PG&E is working to become the safest energy company in the United States. \"Since the 2010 explosion of our natural gas transmission pipeline in San Bruno, we have worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno,\" Tony Earley said. \"We are deeply sorry for this tragic event, and we have dedicated ourselves to re-earning the trust of our customers and the communities we serve. The lessons of this tragic event will not be forgotten.\" On September 9, 2010, a section of PG&E pipeline exploded in San Bruno, killing eight people and injuring more than 50 others. The blast destroyed 37 homes. PG&E said it has paid more than $500 million in claims to the victims and victims' families in San Bruno, which is just south of San Francisco. The company also said it has already replaced more than 800 miles of pipe, installed new gas leak technology and implemented nine of 12 recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board. According to its website, PG&E has 5.4 million electric customers and 4.3 million natural gas customers. The Los Angeles Times reported the previous record penalty was a $146 million penalty against Southern California Edison Company in 2008 for falsifying customer and worker safety data.

Investigators are not expected to return to the crash site, said Capt. Yves Naffrechoux of the High Mountain Gendarmerie. The plane crashed March 24 in rugged terrain of the Alps about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the town of Seyne-les-Alpes. \"All the police investigators have left the (Germanwings) crash site,\" he said. \"There is only a private security company ensuring security around the crash site so that no one can go there.\" The security firm will guard the site until the remaining debris is collected and taken to secure locations for further analysis, if necessary, he said. The flight data recorder, or \"black box,\" was found Thursday by a member of the recovery team. The cockpit voice recorder was found days after the crash. In addition, out of more than 2,000 DNA samples collected from the crash site, lab workers have isolated 150 DNA profiles, said Brice Robin, Marseilles prosecutor. The crash killed all 150 people on board. Brice Robin, Marseilles prosecutor, said authorities have found 470 personnel effects at the site. That number includes 40 cell phones, though all those were badly damaged. Robin cast doubt that any useful information could be retrieved from those phones, given their condition. Authorities say the flight's co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, locked the captain out of the cockpit and engineered the plane's demise. Initial tests on the flight data recorder show that Lubitz purposely used the controls to speed up the plane's descent, according to the French air accident investigation agency, the BEA. It also has emerged that Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Flight 9525 and that he had concealed from his employer recent medical leave notes saying he was unfit for work. Calls for crash avoidance technology. CNN's Margot Haddad reported from Marseille, and Greg Botelho wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 192 words:\nThe nation's top stories will be unfolding Tuesday in courthouses and political arenas across the country. Massachusetts is hosting two of the highest-profile court trials in recent memory -- those of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez and Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Both lengthy trials are coming to a close. In Louisville, Kentucky, Sen. Rand Paul made the not-so-surprising announcement that he will run for president, while in Chicago, voters will head to the polls in a very surprising runoff between Mayor Rahm Emanuel and challenger Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia. And in Ferguson, Missouri, the shadow of Michael Brown and the protests over his shooting by Officer Darren Wilson will loom large over the city's elections. Here's a breakdown of what to expect today and how we got here:. Tsarnaev, who's accused of detonating a bomb at the 2013 Boston Marathon along with his now-deceased brother, faces the stiffest of penalties -- life in prison or the death penalty -- if he's found guilty on any of 17 capital counts against him, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. The 13th juror: What defense? On Monday, survivors and victims' families wept and Tsarnaev fidgeted at a defense table as jurors heard a prosecutor allege that the 21-year-old \"brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets.\" The jury on Tuesday morning began what is expected to be a lengthy deliberation process on 30 total charges, before the so-called penalty phase, should he be found guilty on any counts. It took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that Hernandez killed semi-pro player Odin Lloyd, yet on Monday, Hernandez's defense team wrapped up its witnesses in less than a day. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday, and the jury will begin deliberations soon thereafter. Jurors in Fall River, Massachusetts, will be asked to decide if Hernandez is culpable in the shooting death of Lloyd, whose body was found in a Massachusetts industrial park in the summer of 2013. Much of the evidence against Hernandez is circumstantial, and among the facts the jury will be asked to take into consideration are New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft's testimony, the testimony of Hernandez's fiancee, some grainy footage from Hernandez's home security system and a footprint left by a Nike Air Jordan shoe. Hernandez known for swagger, even in court. OK, sure, no one was floored when the Kentucky senator announced his bid for the Oval Office, but of course it was news when he made it official Tuesday. Paul is expected to hit the campaign trail visiting the all-important early voters in New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada. The physician rode a wave of tea party popularity into the Senate in 2010, where he carefully built a brand of mainstream libertarianism, and he is banking on a coalition of younger voters and traditional Republicans to usher him into the White House. Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz are the only declared candidates for the GOP nomination, though the field will certainly grow and could include the likes of Florida's Jeb Bush, New Jersey's Chris Christie, Wisconsin's Scott Walker, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham and Florida's Marco Rubio. Would Rand be here without Ron? It's the Windy City's first runoff for a citywide office, and it's being billed as a battle for the \"future of Chicago.\" In one corner, you have Emanuel, President Barack Obama's notoriously hard-charging former chief of staff, and in the other, you have Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, a county commissioner who has come to embody populist and liberal Democrats' frustrations with the Chicago incumbent. After Emanuel failed to snare half the vote in February's general election, he will go head-to-head with Garcia. The timing is interesting, too, as Easter, Passover and spring break appear to have spurred more than 142,000 early votes, up from about 90,000 before the first round of voting in February. Following Michael Brown's death, the national spotlight shone on Ferguson, particularly how the city's predominantly black population is woefully underrepresented in its police force and City Council. Yet with all the hubbub about the face of civic leadership, only four in 10 city residents hit the polls in November to cast ballots. Residents speak out ahead of vote. Tuesday's election will bring change, no matter how the ballots are cast: Two black men are running for one of the open seats, and the current lone black council member isn't up for re-election. In another ward, two black women and two white men are vying for an open seat. And a white protester is running for a third post.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nEyewitness video showing white North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager shooting to death an unarmed black man has exposed discrepancies in the reports of the first officers on the scene. Slager has been fired and charged with murder in the death of 50-year-old Walter Scott. A bystander's cell phone video, which began after an alleged struggle on the ground between Slager and Scott, shows the five-year police veteran shooting at Scott eight times as Scott runs away. Scott was hit five times. If words were exchanged between the men, they're are not audible on the tape. It's unclear what happened before Scott ran, or why he ran. The officer initially said that he used a Taser on Scott, who, Slager said, tried to take the weapon. Before Slager opens fire, the video shows a dark object falling behind Scott and hitting the ground. It's unclear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when Slager approaches Scott's body, Slager appears to drop a dark object near Scott. Slager is seen in the video handcuffing Scott after the shooting. Witness: I nearly erased shooting video out of fear. Feidin Santana, the witness who recorded the video, said he didn't see Scott grab Slager's Taser. His account contradicts what Slager told dispatchers. In two interviews with NBC, Santana said that he was walking to his job in North Charleston on Saturday morning when he saw Slager chase Scott, who had been pulled over for a broken taillight. Santana told NBC's Lester Holt on Wednesday that he saw the two men struggling on the ground. \"They were down on the (ground) ... before I started recording,\" Santana said. \"I remember the police (officer) had control of the situation. He had control of Scott.\" Santana said he heard the sound of a Taser being used. He believed Scott was trying to get away from it. But Scott never got the Taser or used it on the officer, Santana told NBC. Who was Walter Scott? A North Charleston Police report included brief statements from eight police officers, but not Slager. One officer, identified as Sgt. J. Gann, said in the report he was conducting a separate traffic stop about 9:30 a.m. Saturday when he heard -- apparently via radio -- Slager say he was \"in foot pursuit\" of another motorist. Gann said that while driving to the officer's location, \"Slager advised that he deployed his Taser and (requested) back up units.\" Seconds later, Gann reported, he heard Slager tell a dispatcher, \"Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser.\" Hours after the shooting, The Post and Courier of Charleston quoted a statement from police spokesman Spencer Pryor, who said Slager attempted to use his Taser to stop a fleeing suspect.  The men struggled over the device, with the suspect taking the Taser and attempting to use it against Slager, the newspaper reported. In the police report, another officer, J. Banias, said he was heading to the scene about 10 minutes after the initial call. Slager asked him to \"secure his vehicle at the site of the traffic stop.\" Banias said he spoke to a passenger in the car Scott was driving. \"The passenger was ... detained and placed in the back seat of my vehicle,\" the officer reported. The passenger's identity was not given in the report, but the officer said in the report that the passenger was detained. Scott family spokesman Ryan Julison confirmed to CNN that a man was with Scott and said he is not related to the family. The family declined to provide any more information. A timeline of events. The North Charleston Police Department is not providing additional information, citing an ongoing investigation of Scott's killing by the independent South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. Gann said when he arrived at the shooting scene, an officer identified only as Habersham \"was administering first aid\" to Scott. \"I exited my vehicle and assisted Officer Habersham with first aid and CPR to the driver,\" Gann said in the report. \"We continued to perform first aid and CPR until EMS arrived... When EMS and first responders arrived, EMS took care over providing care to the driver, who was pronounced deceased a short time later.\" Habersham, in his account, did not mention performing CPR. \"I attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and (directing) the best route for EMS and fire to get to the victim faster,\" he said in the report. An officer identified as Sgt. Webb said that he requested an ambulance. Webb said that at 9:41 a.m. he saw Habersham \"administering chest compression to the defendant.\" North Charleston Police Chief  Eddie Driggers was asked at a news conference this week whether CPR was performed on Scott. \"I do not know. I was told that life-saving ... that they tried to save his life,\" Driggers said. North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey added that not every North Charleston police officer is CPR certified. What we know about Officer Slager.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nCedar Falls, Iowa (CNN)As aides politely tried to rush Ted Cruz from an event in Cedar Falls to one in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Thursday, the presidential candidate continued shaking hands with anyone who wanted to meet him. Finally, after the selfies and conversations started to die down, his aides managed to move him closer to the door when a tall, burly man stopped him. \"Senator,\" he said, \"can I pray with you real quick?\" \"Yeah,\" Cruz said, as he clasped the man's upper arm and the two bowed their heads. It was one of the many moments when Cruz connected with voters on a religious level last week, as the senator from Texas hit the trail in Iowa for the first time as a presidential candidate. Being the only official contender in the race, Cruz drew large crowds during his two-day swing across the state. He's counting on Iowa, known for its vocal and active evangelical base, to propel him forward in what's expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of GOP candidates. Cruz, himself, displays a pastoral swagger when he is speaking on stage and working a room. The senator regularly avoids using a podium, instead favoring pacing the stage with a wireless microphone, a scene reminiscent of a Sunday morning sermon. When he meets with people after events, he embraces each one's hand with both of his, softens his usually theatric tone and looks people square in the eye -- a familiar interaction between churchgoing Christians and their pastors. The past two winners of Iowa's caucuses rose to victory with support from the Christian right, and Cruz, who announced his bid last month at the well-known Baptist school Liberty University, is aiming to energize that same base and claim the coveted state as his prize. Evangelicals make up a large segment of Iowa's Republican voter bloc. According to a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll from January, 44% of likely 2016 Republican caucus-goers said they were born-again or evangelical Christians. Cruz has built a brand as a stalwart conservative willing to buck GOP leadership on fiscal issues, but he showed in Iowa last week that he's also eager to champion social issues at a time when many Republicans are anxious to avoid them. He was one of the loudest defenders of the religious freedom law in Indiana, which came under fire last week for what critics called paving a path to discrimination against gays and lesbians. He described the outrage over the laws as \"shameful\" and an \"assault\" on First Amendment rights. \"There are a lot of people here in Iowa and across the country whose hearts are breaking, watching what has happened in the last two weeks,\" Cruz said Friday night at an event in Des Moines. \"We have seen a grossly unfair vilification of religious liberty.\" RELATED: Republican 2016 hopefuls back Indiana's 'religious freedom' law. He's more than comfortable talking about his own faith and telling the story of how his father became a Christian and a pastor. Rafael Cruz, who's become a celebrity among Christian conservatives, will frequently visit Iowa over the next year, Cruz told voters. And Cruz's Iowa director, Bryan English, is a former pastor. Cruz's first television ads are appearing this weekend during programs on Fox News and NBC that are pegged to Easter Sunday. In the ad, Cruz talks about the impact of the \"transformative love of Jesus Christ\" on his life. While neither Mike Huckabee, who won Iowa in 2008, nor Rick Santorum, who won in 2012, went on to win the nomination, their successes helped launch them into high-profile battles with the then-front-runners. And with both of them likely running again in 2016, the competition will be stiff. That's why, for Cruz, courting evangelicals is only a component of a three-pronged strategy to win the nomination that also includes dominating the tea party faction and competing for the libertarian base. His stump speech hits on elements that appeal to each faction. He received standing ovations last week for calling to abolish the IRS, and, in a knock against the National Security Agency, he frequently tells audiences to leave their cell phones on so President Obama \"can hear every word I have to say.\" Cruz argued Thursday that the Republican Party needs to bridge the gap between what he described as the Ron Paul-Rand Paul faction of the party -- young libertarian-minded voters -- and the Santorum base -- evangelicals. The two blocs, he said, are \"not necessarily the best of chums.\" \"If we're going to win, we've got to bring that coalition together,\" he said in Cedar Falls. \"And I think we can do that.\" Cruz frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels, when more than six in 10 evangelicals voted in the presidential election, a higher than normal turnout for the demographic. That number has waned slightly since 2004 -- but it's not too far off from the 56% of the overall population that voted in 2012. Still, his campaign believes that if it can tap into the group of evangelicals who've been staying home and get the demographic as a whole to overperform, then that could mean the difference of millions more at the polls. \"If you look at available places for the party to expand the vote, it doesn't exist in the middle, it exists in the evangelical vote,\" said Rick Tyler, a top Cruz adviser. \"It isn't a pond, it's an unfished ocean of available voters who are conservative.\" Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said he expects to see record turnout among evangelicals in 2016 no matter who the nominee is or what that person says. Moore points to hot-button topics like religious freedom issues in the U.S., as well as increased attention to the killing of minority Christians in the Middle East and rising anti-Semitism. \"I don't think a candidate is going to be able to get very far simply by using evangelical lingo or by pointing to his or her personal faith,\" Moore said. \"I think a candidate is going to have to explain how he or she would protect religious liberty and would appoint justices and judges who will maintain the common good.\" Later in April, voters in Iowa will see the bulk of the GOP field tackle these issues when they take the stage at an event hosted by the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition. While the past two winners of the Iowa caucuses -- Santorum and Huckabee -- are likely running for president again, Steve Scheffler, president of the group, argued that the field is wide open in terms of who's going to win favor among evangelicals. Jeb Bush, while not popular among conservative activists, was known for his staunch anti-abortion record as Florida governor and touts his Catholic faith as a big force behind his policy views. Scott Walker is the son of a pastor. Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, rose to fame in conservative circles after criticizing the Obama administration at a national prayer breakfast. And other likely candidates -- from Marco Rubio to Rick Perry to Rand Paul -- have made serious efforts to court the religious right. \"It's up for grabs. It's a clean slate regardless of if you've run before,\" Scheffler said. \"Naturally those two (Huckabee and Santorum) have the name recognition and database of people who supported them in the past, but by and large voters are going to say, 'Let me take a good look at all of these candidates.'\"\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nYou may know Mindy Kaling from Fox's cult hit comedy \"The Mindy Project,\" in which she plays Mindy Lahiri, a perky, quirky OB/GYN juggling her career and love life in New York. (Only in the Big Apple can a doctor not afford an apartment!) The show was a breakthrough for on-screen representation — the first network sitcom created by and starring a woman of color — and it looks likely to be renewed for the coming 2015-16 season. Recently, however, Kaling's brother Vijay Chokalingam unveiled a project of his own, and while it has been getting a lot of attention, it hasn't generated quite as many laughs — either from observers or from his famous sibling, who told him it brought \"shame upon their family.\" You see, Chokalingam revealed that, as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, he engaged in a daring (his view) or ridiculous and offensive (pretty much everyone else) scam: He applied to medical school claiming to be African-American. Chokalingam had spent his college years as a \"hard-partying frat boy,\" and achieved a less than stunning 3.1 GPA. Upon facing graduation and exploring his med school options, he realized that fellow Indian-Americans with his grades were getting turned down from the universities of his choice — but that \"black, Hispanic, and Native American applicants with my grades and test scores were much more likely to gain acceptance.\" This revelation led him to make the decision to pose as a black man, both to \"dramatically improve\" his chances of admission, and to illustrate the unfair advantage that blacks and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools. To accomplish this goal, Chokalingam shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks, trimmed his \"long Indian-American eyelashes,\" checked \"black\" under the optional race/ethnicity declaration and submitted his application to 14 schools under his childhood nickname \"JoJo.\" He received invitations for in-person interviews at 11 schools, results that he claims support the notion that African-Americans garner special privileges that are unavailable to whites or Asians. And now that the statute of limitations on his act of fraud has expired, he's looking to write a book on his experiences, titled \"Almost Black: The True Story of an Indian American Who Got Into Medical School Pretending to Be an African American.\" What's truly curious is that even if you agree with Chokalingam that affirmative action is merely a form of \"systematic racism,\" when all is said and done, it offers very little evidence of the \"privilege\" that he claims is accorded to black, Hispanic and Native American candidates. Chokalingam had mediocre grades and MCATs, but he graduated from one of the most prestigious schools in the nation. Yet even while representing himself as black, Chokalingam received only a single admission offer, to St. Louis University's School of Medicine, which falls somewhere between 57th and 67th in national rankings. Harvard, University of Pennsylvania, Columbia and all the higher ranked schools he applied to rejected him. Meanwhile, he admits, pretending to be black came with disadvantages. He found himself being accused of shoplifting by store clerks and harassed by cops — who would regularly stop him while driving and demand that he tell them how much his car cost, implying that he must have stolen it. These acts of very real prejudice, experienced regularly by blacks and Hispanics of all backgrounds — multimillionaire comedian Chris Rock has recently been tweeting pictures of the occasions when he is pulled over by police for no reason — didn't seem to dissuade Chokalingam from his adamant belief in the unfairness of a system that seeks to address the shockingly low numbers of minority health practitioners by providing some weight to race and ethnicity in decision-making. It's not just a matter of what individual applicants \"deserve.\" One-third of Americans are black, Hispanic or Native American; just one in 10 physicians are. Since minority medical practitioners are up to three times as likely to practice in their own communities, this lack of diversity has produced \"doctor deserts,\" in which urban and rural ethnic enclaves across the nation go without access to primary care physicians. Years ago, when I told my father — a doctor from a long line of doctors — that I didn't want to follow in his footsteps, he told me that was fine, because medicine is a service trade, and anyone not interested in serving should avoid the profession. A medical degree isn't a reward to be earned, he said, but a responsibility to be accepted. Which really cuts to the heart of what's so sad about Chokalingam's racial farce. Like others who've recently been exposed for falsely claiming racial identities — including putative presidential candidate Jeb Bush, who registered himself as \"Hispanic\" on a 2009 voter form, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was excoriated during her campaign for having claimed Native American ancestry in the past — Chokalingam wanted to claim the fruits of racial affiliation without having to carry black people's burden. Race isn't just about color or blood; it is about the collective experiences and inherited cultural context and present-day condition of a community of people. Many of the markers of race are persistently corrosive; others are deeply painful. Affirmative action programs are a means of redress for these awful realities of our nation's history; an imperfect one, but necessary. There are some fields where the imbalances might never correct themselves on their own. Industries like health care and Hollywood. Because what's most ironic about Chokalingam's decision to ride on his sister's coattails in telling his story: While Asians are well represented in medicine, our numbers are vanishingly low in the entertainment and media world, and until the recent breakthrough of modern pioneers like Mindy Kaling, it was impossible to imagine film and television that included our faces, voices and stories. Kaling's immense talent and charisma made her a star. But it was a quota-based affirmative action initiative -- NBC's Diversity Writers Program -- that gave her a start.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "Mindy Kaling, known for her role in the hit comedy \"The Mindy Project,\" may soon see her show renewed for another season. Her brother, Vijay Chokalingam, gained attention for his own project, but not for its comedic value. Chokalingam, a University of Chicago graduate with a 3.1 GPA, claimed that Indian-Americans with similar grades were being rejected from medical schools while underrepresented minorities were accepted. In response, he posed as an African-American applicant, shaving his head and checking \"black\" on applications. He received invitations to interview at 11 out of 14 schools, but faced discrimination and harassment as a black man. Despite his belief that affirmative action is \"systematic racism,\" Chokalingam's experiences offer little evidence of privilege, as he only received an offer from a lower-ranked medical school. His planned book, \"Almost Black,\" has sparked controversy, with critics arguing that his actions were offensive and damaging to the cause of racial equality. Kaling's success in Hollywood, which is notoriously underrepresentative of Asians, highlights the importance of affirmative action initiatives in creating opportunities for underrepresented groups.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 93 words:\nNew York (CNN)When Liana Barrientos was 23 years old, she got married in Westchester County, New York. A year later, she got married again in Westchester County, but to a different man and without divorcing her first husband.  Only 18 days after that marriage, she got hitched yet again. Then, Barrientos declared \"I do\" five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other. In 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her \"first and only\" marriage. Barrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of \"offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree,\" referring to her false statements on the 2010 marriage license application, according to court documents. Prosecutors said the marriages were part of an immigration scam. On Friday, she pleaded not guilty at State Supreme Court in the Bronx, according to her attorney, Christopher Wright, who declined to comment further. After leaving court, Barrientos was arrested and charged with theft of service and criminal trespass for allegedly sneaking into the New York subway through an emergency exit, said Detective Annette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. In total, Barrientos has been married 10 times, with nine of her marriages occurring between 1999 and 2002.  All occurred either in Westchester County, Long Island, New Jersey or the Bronx. She is believed to still be married to four men, and at one time, she was married to eight men at once, prosecutors say. Prosecutors said the immigration scam involved some of her husbands, who filed for permanent residence status shortly after the marriages.  Any divorces happened only after such filings were approved. It was unclear whether any of the men will be prosecuted. The case was referred to the Bronx District Attorney's Office by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security's Investigation Division. Seven of the men are from so-called \"red-flagged\" countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Georgia, Pakistan and Mali. Her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, was deported in 2006 to his native Pakistan after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. If convicted, Barrientos faces up to four years in prison.  Her next court appearance is scheduled for May 18.\n\noutput:",

After the movie performed poorly in its international engagements, The Weinstein Co., which first purchased U.S. distribution rights at the 2013 Berlin Film Festival, decided to sell it directly to Lifetime rather than book it into U.S. theaters, a source confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. THR: Grace of Monaco' Cannes review. The film, which was directed by Olivier Dahan and focuses on a period in the early '60s when Monaco was involved in a stand-off over taxes with France and Grace was contemplating a return to Hollywood, was originally scheduled for release in late 2013. Given the names involved, some handicappers had put it on their list of potential Oscar contenders. But when TWC pulled it out of awards contention and shifted its release to March 14, 2014, Dahan lashed out at TWC's Harvey Weinstein, over the movie's final cut, which the director was in the process of completing. \"There are two versions of the film for now, mine and his,\" Dahan complained, continuing, \"They want a commercial film smelling of daisies, taking out anything that exceeds that which is too abrupt, anything that makes it cinematic and breathe with life.\" That planned March release was then scrubbed, when Cannes expressed interest in debuting the director's version of the movie in May. Even before it screened, though, Grace's children blasted the picture as \"needlessly glamorized and historically inaccurate\" and boycotting the Cannes red carpet. THR: The Weinstein Co. nearing deal to keep 'Grace of Monaco' Weinstein didn't attend the movie's premiere either -- explaining that he had been visiting Syrian refugee camps in Jordan as part of a long-scheduled U.N.-sponsored trip. But TWC did strike a new distribution deal for the film in Cannes, agreeing to show Dahan's cut in the U.S., but acquiring rights for just $3 million upfront, a $2 million discount from its earlier contract.

The National Weather Service indicated a tornado may have touched down in the small town of Potosi, Missouri, about 70 miles from St. Louis. CNN affiliate KMOV reported that it had received reports of wind damage and flooding in the town. One Instagram user there posted a photo of a fallen tree. Aerial footage also showed damage to roofs and one street overtaken by water. Not far away from Potosi, Shyler and Christin Strube in Leadington posted an Instagram picture of some unusual dark clouds. And a Twitter user in Farmington got bad news when he went out to his car. \"They weren't kidding when they said baseball size (hail),\" Kevin Knox wrote.

The state trooper stopped the bus carrying Nelly and five other people on Interstate 40 in Putnam County on Saturday because it wasn't displaying U.S. Department of Transportation and International Fuel Tax Association stickers, according to Tennessee authorities. The trooper was about to conduct an inspection of the bus, a Prevost motor coach, when he \"noticed an odor of marijuana emitting from the vehicle,\" authorities said in a statement. Two troopers then searched the bus, finding \"five colored crystal-type rocks that tested positive for methamphetamine, as well as a small amount of marijuana and other drug paraphernalia,\" the statement said. The search also turned up several handguns and 100 small Ziploc bags, which the statement said are commonly used for selling drugs. The guns included a gold-plated .50-caliber Desert Eagle pistol, a .45-caliber Taurus pistol and a .500 Smith & Wesson magnum. Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Haynes, was taken to the Putnam County Jail along with another passenger. He later posted bond and left the jail, the Putnam County Sheriff's Office said.

Oliver Minatel, 22, said he was sleeping on Air Canada Flight 8623 from Toronto when he felt something around his neck. \"With a rope, something that he has, he just jumped on me. That's what happened,\" Minatel told CNN's Paula Newton moments after the incident. She was seated four rows behind Minatel, a professional soccer player traveling with his team. The incident occurred about a half-hour before the flight landed, after the pilots had begun their descent. \"I forced it (the cord) down and then other people came to help, and then I got out and he started saying that we were here to kill him,\" Minatel said. The man was not restrained for the rest of the trip, but the flight crew told him to stay seated with his seat belt on. The man kept trying to get out of his seat but other passengers yelled at him whenever he tried to stand up. The two-hour flight landed at Atlanta's Hartsfield airport at about 4:30 p.m.  where it was met by U.S. authorities.  The suspect was escorted off the plane. An FBI spokesman confirmed the agency responded to the incident. \"The passenger, however, was transported for medical/mental evaluation under the direction and coordination of the Atlanta Police Department,\" Special Agent Stephen Emmett said. \"While there are currently no federal charges pending, the facts of the matter are being relayed to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Atlanta.\" Minatel, a forward from Brazil, was traveling with his teammates from the Ottawa Fury Football Club of the second-division North American Soccer League.  They are scheduled to play the Atlanta Silverbacks on Saturday. \"We're very thankful to everyone who came to the aid of Oliver and relieved that he's O.K. and ready to play in our game,\" Fury FC Head Coach Marc Dos Santos said in a statement posted on the team's website. Several witnesses said they saw the suspect try to choke Minatel with the cord of his headphones. Kevin Kerr says he was seated next to the suspect. \"He was talking about how this soccer team was trying to kill him. I thought he was maybe a deranged fan,\" said Kerr. Kerr said he fell asleep and he awakened to see the suspect trying to choke Minatel. \"I assisted to make sure that didn't happen,\" Kerr said. The Canadian businessman said he and members of the soccer team kept a close eye on the suspect as the plane landed to make sure he did not threaten other passengers.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nChange is coming to Ferguson. In the next few weeks the Department of Justice (DOJ) will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department, which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination. It should not be forgotten that the DOJ review of the Ferguson Police Department was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer and by revelations about the town's dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups. Now, after a half year of unrest, and with citizens on Tuesday electing two new black city council members, change is beginning to come to Ferguson. The question is, what kind of change? The report from the Department of Justice offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens. Through illegal traffic stops and arrests, and the use of excessive force, the police department held town residents in bondage. The municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time. Court costs and fees constituted the second-largest sources of revenue for the town. Rather than a force for public safety, the Ferguson Police Department became, according to Attorney General Eric Holder, \"a collection agency\" -- one that preyed disproportionately on the town's African-American residents. The evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating. It included blatantly racist emails traded among officers, and evidence that African-Americans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department. But just a few weeks before the release of the report, the Ferguson police chief declared there were \"no racial issues\" in his department. Ferguson's ugly, racist emails released. The recommendations in the report, ranging from new training and supervision of police officers, addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system, will, if implemented, remake the law enforcement system in the town. (A grand jury that investigated the shooting of Brown by Officer Darren Wilson chose not to file charges against him and the Justice Department also didn't find reason to prosecute.) Without question, change is coming to the town's government. Town Manager John Shaw, Ferguson's most powerful official and, until the DOJ's blistering report, the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny, resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city's deputy manager. Three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and, on Tuesday, citizens elected two black candidates to the city council, changing its racial composition: Five of six members and the mayor were white. Now the council will be 50% black. Ferguson's hapless police Chief Thomas Jackson also finally resigned after holding on through a months-long display of astonishing incompetence. The department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests.  The appointment of a commander from the State Highway Patrol was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest. Jackson's departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command. And so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council, there will be a new police chief in Ferguson. But does that mean that fundamental change will come to Ferguson? Not necessarily. Not unless protest and activism during this critical period turns to influence the vitally important opportunities that lie ahead in the coming weeks. The Department of Justice's full-on negotiations with the leadership in Ferguson will determine the shape of the new Ferguson Police Department. Indeed, the DOJ report alludes to the possibility of disbanding the department in favor of a regional policing integration with St. Louis County. Many local activists have suggested just such a solution, but given ongoing problems with policing in the county -- including the role of county forces in some of the most controversial clashes with activists in Ferguson last fall -- community representatives will have to fight hard to ensure that the DOJ can fold St. Louis County Police into its monitoring and reform process. Equally important were the April 7 general elections. Turnout in municipal elections has been notoriously low in Ferguson, with white voters nearly three times more likely to turn out than African-Americans. But local groups had engaged in vigorous voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns.. The Mayor has two years left to his term and has defiantly insisted that he will not resign (although a petition for his recall has been circulating). That means that he will be a lead voice in negotiating with the DOJ to remake the police department. Has he committed to a clear set of principles that will guide his participation in those talks? Community activists and residents must ensure that Mayor James Knowles plans to represent their vision of new Ferguson Police Department. But there is an opportunity to begin thinking about even more ambitious structural change in Ferguson and throughout St. Louis County. Ferguson's governing structure, with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor, mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the United States. That form of governance might have been precisely what thriving, middle class white suburbanites wanted when they fled racial integration in cities like St. Louis. But working class suburbs like Ferguson with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents, may need a more robust form of governance. In any case, a system in which the elected officials have minimal power, but non-elected leaders, like the town manager and the chief of police, have inordinate power, is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable, non-representative government that controlled Ferguson's residents. Yet this precise form of government is in wide use across the country. Likewise, Missouri, like the vast majority of states, holds municipal elections in non-presidential election years, guaranteeing a significantly lower voter turnout -- although only a few states hold the primary and general election in March and April as Missouri law requires Ferguson to do. It's not that Ferguson is so different than towns across America. It's precisely because Ferguson holds up a mirror to flaws in our democratic system of government in towns across this country that the stakes are so high. Ferguson residents now have the opportunity to begin a movement for change in the other 89 jurisdictions in St. Louis County plagued by similar governance flaws, including those towns led by African-Americans. And Ferguson's example should provoke self-examination in working class suburbs across the country, where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population. Change is coming to Ferguson. But the scope and breadth of that change will depend upon the ambition and discipline of activists and residents, whose passion and tenacity have already transformed the trajectory of leadership in a typical American town.\n\noutput:",

The future of Ferguson's police department is uncertain, with the possibility of disbanding it and integrating it with St. Louis County's police force. The April 7 elections saw increased voter turnout, and community activists must ensure that the mayor represents their vision for the new police department. Additionally, Ferguson's governance structure and low voter turnout in municipal elections are issues that need addressing in other towns across the country. Change is coming to Ferguson, but its scope and breadth will depend on the ambition and discipline of activists and residents.",

That's what she said in a video posted to Facebook that shows her group packing up from their Alaska Airlines plane as it sat at the gate in Hawaii. \"You're taking me off the airplane because I don't have a doctor's note saying I can fly,\" a woman is heard saying. \"All these people are waiting, and I'm being removed as if  I'm a criminal or contagious, because I have cancer and no note to fly.\" Sedway did eventually get on a flight back to San Jose, California, although she didn't get home until late Tuesday night. And she got an apology. \"We regret the inconvenience Ms. Sedway experienced ... and are very sorry for how the situation was handled,\" Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Bobbie Egan said. \"... While our employee had the customer's well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.\" Her cancer fight notwithstanding, Sedway was in Hawaii in time to celebrate her 14th wedding anniversary. Still, on Monday, she was on a plane to head east. Then, according to her Facebook post, an airline employee who saw Sedway seated in the handicapped section asked her how she was doing. The second time she inquired, Sedway wrote that she responded by saying she sometimes felt weak. That was followed by a call to a doctor, then her removal from the plane. Egan, the Alaska Airlines spokeswoman, acknowledged that the carrier's policy when someone has a medical issue is to call MedLink, a group of ER nurses and doctors. The idea, she explained, is that \"it is better to address medical issues or concerns on the ground rather than in the air, especially on flights to or from Hawaii\" -- which in that case would last five-plus hours over open ocean. The decision to pull Sedway from the flight was done with \"the customer's well-being\" in mind, according to Egan. Still, that doesn't mean it was the right decision. Alaska Airlines since apologized to Sedway \"for the disruption this has caused,\" in addition to refunding her family's tickets and paying for their overnight accommodations.\" Even though she was stuck in Hawaii, Sedway made clear on Facebook that this was a real \"disruption.\" \"Because of this, I will miss my chemotherapy, my children will miss school and my husband will miss important meetings,\" she said.\n\noutput:",

They were World War I soldiers, four of almost 2,000, whose writings have recently been found underneath battlefields near Naours, France, about 120 miles north of Paris. Photographer Jeff Gusky, who has been chronicling details of the site, describes the inscriptions -- and the underground city in which they were found -- as \"breathtaking.\" \"This is a treasure trove,\" he said Monday night from his home in East Texas, where he works as an ER doctor. \"Even locally, no one realized what was there.\" Gusky, a National Geographic photographer, has chronicled the area in a portfolio he calls \"The Hidden World of WWI.\" The revelations of the underground city, which extends for miles in some directions, have come to light recently only because of a series of events, Gusky said. The underground city actually dates back centuries but was sealed up in the 18th century. It was rediscovered in the late 19th century. During World War I, soldiers would take refuge in the carved-out rooms and pathways. The front was sometimes mere miles away; the Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest in world history, was fought nearby in 1916. The land was privately owned for many years and generally off-limits to outsiders, said Gusky, but it changed hands in 2013. The rights to operate it were purchased by a consortium of villages that wanted to promote awareness of the area's history, he said. Researching the city is a painstaking task. For one thing, it's dark, so observers generally haven't realized what's in there until they've gone exploring. Moreover, the maze-like extensiveness of the site has made discovery a slow process. \"They go on and on and on. They're so elaborate in some places, there are maps carved into stone so the soldiers wouldn't get lost,\" he said. The graffiti looks like it was written yesterday, he added. Gusky has noted 1,821 names. About 40% are Australian, with most of the others identified as British. Fifty-five are Americans, and 662 have yet to be traced. For Gusky, the graffiti provides a human connection with men who lived a century ago. In many cases, they just wanted to be remembered, he said. \"Someone could be in this place one day and the next fighting at the front,\" he said. Leach, \"merely a private,\" was killed a month later in battle, Gusky observed. \"It could very well have been the last time he recorded his name as a living, breathing human being,\" he said. 7 things you didn't know about the man who started WWI.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "In a French chalk quarry near Naours, about 13 soldiers' graffiti from World War I have been discovered, dating back almost 1916. The inscriptions include names like HJ Leach, a private from Australia, and HA Deanate from the 184th Aero Squadron, USA. The site, an underground city, was rediscovered in the late 19th century and used by soldiers as shelter during the war. It extends for miles and was sealed up in the 18th century. The land was privately owned until 2013, when it was purchased by a consortium of villages to promote its historical significance. The graffiti, which numbers around 1916, provides a human connection to the past, with about 1916 being Australian and 1916 American. One inscription, \"HJ Leach. Merely a private. 1916-07-13.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nLondon (CNN)It wasn't messrs Clooney, Pitt and their nine accomplices who sailed down an elevator shaft and cracked open dozens of safety deposit boxes at a London vault during the Easter weekend. But last weekend's raid in the heart of the city's jewelry  district feels like it has been taken from a movie like \"Ocean 11\" given its daring and planning. Such robberies are rare: the gang didn't follow the current criminal trend of manipulating digits in cyber space but instead went back to basics and committed their burglary in a way not seen in London for more than 40 years. In September 1971, the staff of a bank in Baker Street, central London, arrived at work to find that thieves had dug a 40-yard tunnel from a shop they had rented, hauled in a thermic lance and explosives and opened the strong room. The gang got away with a haul worth around £30 million (the incident later formed the basis of the movie \"The Bank Job.\") But how are such heists organized? Roy Ramm, a former commander of specialist operations at London's Scotland Yard for 27 years, explains. In the UK burglaries and robberies are often committed by working-class people, people who would otherwise have blue collar jobs. In more than 25 years as a Scotland Yard detective, I never met a Raffles- or a Thomas Crown-style criminal from a middle-class background who had then turned to the hard side of crime. Sophisticated heists like the Hatton Garden raid are generally not a natural progression for burglars who began with smaller domestic break-ins. Many neighborhood criminals commit burglaries to feed drugs habits and acquire long strings of convictions that mean they are always on the police radar.  Occasionally, they steal things they can't sell and end up dumping valuable paintings or antiques when they are not able to sell them on quickly. More specialist criminals -- those, for example, who target museums or country houses -- will be very specific and steal only what they know they can quickly convert to untraceable cash. Many of those who commit the bigger crimes or run major criminal enterprises combine high IQs with a kind of raw street intelligence. One of their skills is the ability to recognize a criminal opportunity when it presents itself, possibly from a source of inside information. Probably the biggest difference between any heist you'll see in a movie and its real-life equivalent is the motive. I've never encountered any criminal who committed a high value crime just for the challenge or to prove that it could be done. The only reason has been for the money, often to support a certain lifestyle and to fund other criminal enterprises. Inside information is one way of identifying a criminal opportunity, using people who are able to provide that crucial detail or who will participate in some small way to facilitate the crime. The Brinks MAT robbery in 1983 -- a case which I was involved in at the time -- saw a criminal gang escape with gold bullion worth more than £28 million (around £88 million -- or $130million -- adjusting for inflation) from a warehouse at London's Heathrow Airport. The Knightsbridge safety deposit robbery of 1987 saw a gang make off with tens of millions of pounds in cash and valuables from an upscale London neighbourhood (the true amount will never be known). Both were made possible by inside information: it's an angle that London detectives investigating last weekend's heist will be looking at very closely. The planning behind the Hatton Garden raid will have been meticulous. The target will have been observed, perhaps for months, and the thieves will have decided on the right time to commit the crime.  A long weekend or a public holiday are occasions when more time may be available, also perhaps when regular staff are away. Sometimes the mastermind behind the raid will need a larger team of criminals to do a specific job. Usually they will already be known directly to each other, perhaps because they worked on other jobs together. Possibly a specialist can be brought in by another team member -- but they have to be able to trust each other and trust comes from understanding, so gangs in the UK tend to come from the same social and ethnic group, maybe even limited to one relatively small geographic area. Even though there is more diversity in society, it would be unusual to find a broad ethnic or social mix in the team put together for a major crime. Vehicles will have been obtained, stolen or purchased for cash and their identities cloned or changed. Equipment will have been sourced. Everything will have been cleaned, cleaned and cleaned again to remove forensic traces. They will plan routes that avoid CCTV and timings that attract the least attention. They will have untraceable disposable phones and an outside team to warn the inside men of any problems. They will have planned their getaway, their clean-up and how and when they are going to dispose of anything that might link them to the crime scene -- and of course how they are going to sell on the proceeds of their crime. What criminals steal doesn't vary that much. Cash is probably first choice, followed by anything that can quickly and easily be converted to cash, like gold, jewellery and watches. The conversion of stolen goods to cash is risky and expensive: the Brinks MAT bullion that was traced was because it had been clumsily smelted and then sold on. Fine paintings and rare antiques are less desirable for experienced criminals -- unless they are stealing to order -- because they are so identifiable and because the black market is so much smaller. A painting may sell at an international auction for millions of dollars but it will only fetch a fraction of its true value from a dishonest collector. London detectives investigating the Hatton Garden heist will be looking very closely at the possibility of inside involvement. But police enquiries won't stop there. They will look at every aspect of how the target business operates, then try to think like criminals to identify the weaknesses in physical and operational security that the gang may have been informed about or else spotted and then exploited. The forensic assault on the crime scene will be immense. In recent years forensic science has made major advances in identifying trace evidence and investigators will look for any scrap of evidence that might yield the DNA of a criminal. CCTV footage from street cameras and from inside private premises will be analyzed and vehicle movements logged and cross-checked. Rewards for information will be offered. Witnesses will interviewed. In the police's criminal intelligence branch, the movements of known criminals will be analyzed and the networks of sources -- informers -- will be tasked to report what they hear. The details of any identifiable goods which have been stolen will be circulated to known markets, both in the UK and internationally. The detectives investigating these major crimes in the UK see them as an exciting challenge to their professionalism. They don't admire the criminals but they have less contempt for a gang that builds a sophisticated plan and causes no personal harm to anyone than say for a violent robber. But the investigation will still be relentless.\n\noutput:",

Those are just a few of the stories that trended this week. 1. 'Star Wars' streaming. The Force is with the streaming device of your choice, thanks to this week's surprise announcement that the entire \"Star Wars\" saga (so far, anyway) would be released on digital HD at the end of the week. Between this and the release of \"Daredevil,\"  we imagine lots of nerds called in sick on Friday. 2. Mindy Kaling's brother: I faked being black to get into medical school. Actress Mindy Kaling's brother says that he posed as a black man years ago to get into medical school and that the experience opened his eyes to what he calls the hypocrisy of affirmative action. Among those who disapprove of the book he's planning to write about the whole thing: his sister. 3. Farewell, Rosco. \"Dukes of Hazzard\" fans mourned the loss of actor James Best, best known as Hazzard County's hapless sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane, this week. Others who passed on: \"L.A. Law\" actor Richard Dysart and frequent Clint Eastwood co-star Geoffrey Lewis. 4. When Burger met King, it was love. Joel Burger is set to marry Ashley King in July, and when fast food giant Burger King got wind of the nuptials, the couple scored a free wedding. 5. Michelle Obama broke it down (again) The first lady's Let's Move campaign has featured her dancing on more than one occasion, but she brought the (White) House down on Monday with the \"So You Think You Can Dance\" all-stars during the Easter egg roll. 6. \"The Vampire Diaries\" crisis. Not since Zayn Malik announced that he was quitting One Direction has Twitter had such a meltdown: \"Vampire Diaries\" star Nina Dobrev is leaving the CW series. \"Nothing will be the same again,\" one fan tweeted. Other things we loved:. More than 10 million people have seen Anne Hathaway's take on Miley Cyrus' \"Wrecking Ball,\" complete with props, from Spike's hit show \"Lip Sync Battle.\" Go, greased lightning! \"Late Late Show\" host and Tony winner James Corden put on \"Grease\" for Los Angeles drivers waiting in traffic. The cast of the movie \"Suicide Squad,\" including Will Smith and Margot Robbie, assembled for the first time this week in a Twitter photo from director David Ayer. And no worries, future Joker Jared Leto was taking the photo (in an image inspired by classic comic book \"The Killing Joke\"). The comments are the whole reason to read this \"Humans of New York\" post on a woman named Beyonce.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nDurham, North Carolina (CNN)President Obama's nomination of Loretta Lynch to become the country's first African-American woman attorney general is a historic pick.  Her confirmation, however, is now taking on new historical relevance as her wait for a confirmation vote by the full Senate drags into its sixth month. The period between the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote to confirm and the full Senate vote -- which in Lynch's case has not been scheduled -- has lasted longer for her than for any attorney general nominee in recent history. By the time the Senate returns from Easter recess on Monday, it'll have been longer than the eight previous nominees for the job -- combined. Lynch, currently the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, cleared the committee February 26 by a vote of 12-8, with Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona joining Democrats in sending the nomination to the full Senate. Obama nominated Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder on November 8, after Holder had announced plans to leave the post weeks earlier. Hundreds of miles from Washington, longtime residents of Durham, North Carolina, were beaming with pride.  Lynch's family moved to the city when she was a child.  Her parents, married for 60 years, still live there.  They watched the announcement on television. \"That was encouraging but I knew then that we had a fight on our hands,\" said Lynch's father, the Rev. Lorenzo Lynch.  \"I've been in politics most of my life. I know that nothing is certain, and I know that nothing is easy.\" Lorenzo Lynch, 82, is a retired Baptist preacher and was active in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.  He ran, unsuccessfully, for mayor of Durham in 1973. For the next round of his daughter's \"fight,\" he traveled to Washington in late January to attend his daughter's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee. \"I heard a lot at that hearing that I've heard since childhood.  That is the presupposition of the mindset,\" Lorenzo Lynch said.  \"The dual system or the dual treatment.\" When asked to provide specific examples, Lorenzo Lynch deferred to the state branch of the NAACP and E. Lavonia Allison, a Durham activist who has known Loretta Lynch since the family moved to Durham. \"I don't want to think about the epidermis, but some people are thinking that way,\" Allison said, suggesting that Lynch's confirmation vote has been delayed because Lynch is African-American. \"When it has taken so long, when it has been so different from any other person who has been nominated ... how else can we interpret that it is so different?\" Allison said. In March, Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-North Carolina, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said, \"I think race certainly can be considered as a major factor in the reason for this delay, but it's also the irrationality of the new Republicans.\" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, evoked imagery of the segregated South in criticism of Republicans, saying Lynch had been \"asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar.\" Durbin was harshly criticized by Arizona's Sen. John McCain. \"I deeply regret that the senator from Illinois chose to come here yesterday and question the integrity and motivation, mine and my Republican colleagues,\" McCain said on the Senate floor.  \"It was offensive and unnecessary, and I think he owes this body, Ms. Lynch and all Americans an apology,\" McCain added. \"I thought he should be commended,\" Lorenzo Lynch said.  \"I think that's a poetic description of what has happened and poetry, like most language, is limited but it does have wings ... to carry a point.\" Giuliani pushes for Lynch confirmation. Senate Republicans adamantly deny the delay in scheduling a vote on Lynch's nomination is because she is African-American. Many point out that Lynch, if confirmed, will be replacing the country's first African-American attorney general who was confirmed by an overwhelming margin. Instead, Republicans and Democrats say the delay is part of an ongoing partisan battle.  For some, it's part of a fight over a human trafficking bill that has stalled in the Senate.  For others, the delay is retaliation for President Obama's 2014 executive actions on immigration. On the eve of Holder's announcement of his plans to leave the Department of Justice, the political number crunchers at FiveThirtyEight.com predicted that whoever the President nominated would \"likely face at least a moderately tough confirmation hearing in the Senate.\" Some of Lynch's supporters across North Carolina have organized to convince the state's two Republican senators to support Lynch's confirmation.  In March, several dozen North Carolina women, led by the NAACP, traveled to Washington to meet with their senators, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis. Reportedly, the meeting lasted nearly an hour and was very cordial. At a news conference at the Washington Press Club, the group blasted the senators for opposing the nomination. \"Senator Burr and Senator Tillis, it is time for you to act like you have some sense.  It's past time.  You have embarrassed the state of North Carolina,\" Allison said after the meeting. For their part, Burr and Tillis released a statement after the meeting: \"While we remain concerned with Ms. Lynch's stated desire to lead the Department of Justice in the same manner as Eric Holder and will not be supporting her nomination, we are grateful that the group came to Washington to talk about this issue and exchange ideas. Weeks later, the NAACP organized protests outside the senators' offices in Raleigh, Charlotte and Wilmington. \"I think there is a much deeper analysis,\" said North Carolina NAACP Branch President Rev. William Barber II.  \"I believe if she had been Clarence Thomas, she would have been confirmed.\" \"Because of her courage, her character and her commitment to the law and to the enforcement of the laws of this land, particularly the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution, and because her consciousness was shaped in the crucible of the civil rights movement -- that is what they fear,\" Barber said. Obama turns up the heat on Loretta Lynch confirmation 'limbo' Lorenzo Lynch says he carried his daughter to several civil rights marches on his shoulders.  He admits that he did not think that much of the recent progress of African-Americans was possible when he was fighting for equal rights. Now, his small living room is filled with stacks of loosely organized newspaper stories about his daughter's nomination and photos of his visit to the White House. Lynch admits that he's never told his only daughter that he's proud of her, although he's sure she knows it.  He plans to change that, soon, regardless of the outcome of her pending nomination.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nThere was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that Rolling Stone retracted on Sunday night -- a part of the story that was never disputed: The University of Virginia is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus. The school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it. The Virginia attorney general asked the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students. That includes how UVA officials handled the allegations in the discredited Rolling Stone article by a student the magazine called \"Jackie,\" especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out. The alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012, and Jackie told the university about it the next spring. She started telling her story very publicly, including at a \"take back the night\" rally. But Charlottesville police didn't hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014, in which Jackie claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face. When a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault, she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident. In both cases, police said Jackie refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case. But more women came forward to talk about their experiences -- women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as Jackie's. Rolling Stone's story opened up a conversation about the topic, and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims. Many women told CNN about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus. They'd call it a \"bad experience.\" Others told CNN that there were fraternities with reputations for being \"rapey\" and for using date-rape drugs. That some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman's outfit. And if a woman did report her rape, some women complained that the internal process didn't seem worth it if their abuser wouldn't be kicked out of school. Rolling Stone had a line in its original story: \"UVA's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998, 183 people have been expelled for honor-code violations such as cheating on exams. And yet paradoxically, not a single student at UVA has ever been expelled for sexual assault.\" After the article published, UVA admitted this and instituted a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward -- although that policy was never defined, so it's unclear what it means. When the story was deleted from Rolling Stone's website, that was lost. \"You lose a lot of other people's voices who were in that article,\" said Sarah Roderick, a survivor and UVA student, \"and a lot of good things that could have come about. Fixing problems with administration here and on our campus\" -- and, she added, across the nationo. Along with the O'Melveny & Myers investigation, there's also an open Title IX investigation into UVA by the U.S. Department of Education as a result of a civil suit. The attorney who filed the suit, James Marsh, told CNN that UVA medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he's representing, making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice. When the Columbia Journalism School's 12,000-plus-word critique is summed up, it really boils down to this: The mistake could have been avoided if the writer, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of Jackie who she claimed were with her that night. They'd later tell other media outlets, including CNN, that they remembered a very different story. Rolling Stone says their account would have been a red flag. And all three say they would have talked if they'd been called. Ryan Duffin, one of the trio, said he felt deceived by Jackie, but he also pointed out that Erdely's mistake in fact-checking was about one single incident, and the fallout has caused a much bigger issue to be lost. \"Had she gotten in direct contact with us, it probably wouldn't have been printed, at least in that way,\" he said. \"A lot of the article was still based in truth, but the focal point would have been different.\" It might have been less dramatic, but it would have probably focused on some of the other UVA students who shared much more common stories of acquaintance rape on campus. \"I think my problem with it was that this reporter wanted to sensationalize an experience that's not very common,\" Roderick said. \"... And I wonder if it would have been different if (it dealt) with someone with a less horrific story -- something that happens to more people. I think this discredits what a lot of survivors go through. Something this physically horrific is not what everyone goes through. Now it's like, 'If I wasn't assaulted by more than one man then my story is not as worthy of attention.' It's frustrating that this is how rape is portrayed on college campuses because this is not the norm.\" Before the report came out, Abraham Axler, the student body president, said that some good had come from the article because it forced UVA to institute new policies and to open up a conversation on a topic that needed to be discussed nationwide. But some survivors and advocates are afraid the retraction set back their progress. \"I do feel like there's a possibility people will be afraid to come forward. If you come forward and share your story, if you don't have the date right, every detail down, you'll think, 'I'm going to be accused of being a liar. It's easier for me to keep it to myself,'\" Roderick said. \"There are very serious and unresolved questions about the university's performance,\" said Steve Coll, dean of the Columbia School of Journalism. \"Rolling Stone teed that subject up. I wouldn't say that everything about Rolling Stone's treatment of that subject was perfect, but it certainly doesn't fall under the same category as their reporting about Jackie's narrative.\"\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 168 words:\nA year after its Cannes debut and finally seeing a theatrical release, \"Lost River\" is still causing quite a stir. Booed at its premiere and mocked by reviewers, Ryan Gosling's first feature as director has been divisive, to put it mildly. But there has been one shining light cutting through the fog of critical hyperbole: its setting, a besmirched and decaying Detroit. Wavering on the brink of annihilation, yet providing kindling for its own rebirth, the city is captured in all its waning splendor, the perfect backdrop for Gosling's post-industrial gothic. Speaking about the film in London, Gosling made clear that the city was at the heart of the project -- in fact, without Detroit's crumbling edifices there would be no film at all. Gosling said that \"Lost River\" began as a collection of speculative shots of the Brewster-Douglass Projects, the first black social housing development in America and a place Motown legends The Supremes and boxer Joe Louis once called home. \"I heard [the authorities] were going to tear them down,\" Gosling said. \"I had to shoot them before they did.\" Taking time out between acting jobs, he ventured into the projects. \"I started shooting more and more,\" he explained, \"and then I realized that I was making a film. Then I started writing [the script] during the process of filming.\" Gosling's affection for the Motor City is longstanding, the actor growing up \"not too far away\" in Cornwall, Ontario. \"It seemed like everything cool came from Detroit... the whole American Dream,\" he reminisces. \"The Model-T, Motown, the refrigerator...\" Now though he references \"40 miles of dead neighborhoods,\" the city declaring bankruptcy. \"Houses are burning and things are being torn down,\" he says, \"and within that there are families trying to hold on to their homes. For them it has become a nightmare and I wanted to make a film about that.\" The title itself alludes to a once thriving community now displaced, its homes at the bottom of a reservoir built with little concern for the residents -- man-made interference with untold social repercussions. Speaking in broader terms, Gosling argues \"there are Lost Rivers everywhere and we wanted to share the experience these people were having.\" On screen he paints a nihilistic image of wanton destruction; torched properties and bulldozers jostling for our attention amid acts of extreme human violence -- sometimes self-inflicted. The director plainly states that as a location it \"was pretty dangerous.\" He describes \"an energy there that was threatening... We had a very charmed experience [filming]. It worked its way into the fabric of the movie --- a tone of impending threat that was just there.\" However there are signs of humanity and regeneration amongst the chaos, on camera and off. For the film's young protagonist, every raid on an unoccupied house offers copper piping waiting to be recast and ultimately reclaimed. Similarly, Gosling references the Heidelberg Project during the discussion, a community organization in the city's McDougall-Hunt neighborhood, reimagining derelict buildings as giant canvases for budding artists. He recalls seeing \"one house covered with teddy bears, another covered in clocks... people taking spaces and personalizing them.\" The city's scope for urban renewal was clearly a draw. \"Something really interesting is happening in Detroit at the moment -- a rebirth. People redefining what they are,\" according to Gosling. \"There's a resilience there and an energy, and it's exciting.\" As much as the visual content of \"Lost River\" revolves around a maudlin preoccupation with dereliction -- and perhaps plays on the outside world's perception of Detroit -- aspects of the narrative suggest hope and the possibility of reincarnation for the city. Gosling claims this paradox should exist when discussing Detroit, and is precisely what the film is trying to convey. \"We want people to know that dereliction is happening there, but that it's not only what is happening there,\" he argues. \"It doesn't define Detroit, it's just part of what it's dealing with right now.\" \"Lost River\" receives a limited theatrical release in the U.S. and UK on April 10.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "Ryan Gosling's directorial debut, \"Lost River,\" which had a divisive reception after its Cannes premiere, showcases the decaying beauty of Detroit. The city, on the brink of annihilation yet providing kindling for its own rebirth, served as the inspiration for the post-industrial gothic film. Gosling filmed in the Brewster-Douglass Projects before their demolition and began the project out of a desire to preserve the area's history. Growing up near Detroit, Gosling was drawn to the city's iconic status as the birthplace of the American Dream. Despite the city's current state of 10s of miles of abandoned neighborhoods and bankruptcy, Gosling sees signs of regeneration and human resilience. The film portrays a nihilistic image of destruction but also highlights moments of hope and reincarnation. \"Lost River\" receives a limited theatrical release on April 10, 168 words.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nHavana, Cuba (CNN)All eyes are going to be on the new kid finally allowed to play and the big kid who for so long wanted nothing to do with him -- Cuba and the United States in the same diplomatic playground. Cuba pulled off a diplomatic coup by marshaling the support of other regional countries to insist on their attendance at the Summit of the Americas. And for the first time since 1962, the U.S. has not blocked Cuba's attempt to join. Now it's time to see how they play and who they play with -- especially Venezuela, which often falls out with Washington for crushing dissent at home and supplying Havana with billions of dollars in oil. Cuba is trying to re-establish itself at the two-day summit in Panama, arriving with more than 100 government officials, diplomats, small business people and artists. But Cuba's attempts to rebrand itself as an open, diverse society stumbled Wednesday when government supporters and anti-Castro supporters brawled in the streets of Panama. Video of the incident showed Cuban government officials exchanging punches and insults with dissidents until Panamanian police in riot gear broke up the melee. With the historic thawing in relations between the U.S. and Cuba, Washington now has urgent business to discuss with Havana. \"We have really big issues with the Cubans that do need to be solved,\" said Ambassador Vicki Huddleston, who served as the chief of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. She added \"The Cubans are typical of their negotiating style. You think it's going to be easy because we have said 'We are going to have good relations with you' and they say, 'That's not exciting for us and it is for you.' So they are hard negotiators as they always have been.\" The forum could provide the opportunity to push forward an agreement to re-establish formal relations and re-open embassies after nearly four months of negotiations. While President Barack Obama is not scheduled to meet Cuban leader Raul Castro, U.S. officials said there will be opportunities for \"interaction\" between the two leaders. The first time the two heads of state met was in 2013 at Nelson Mandela's funeral. Their brief handshake captured the world's attention and lit up social media. Few people then knew that the two countries were secretly involved in negotiations to thaw five decades of deadlocked Cold War-era relations. Obama had said he had hoped a U.S. Embassy would reopen in Havana before the summit, but Cuban officials have said they cannot imagine a full restoration of diplomatic ties until Cuba is removed from the U.S. State Department list of countries that support terrorism. \"It would be difficult to explain that diplomatic relations have been resumed while Cuba has been unjustly listed as a state sponsor of international terrorism,\" said Josefina Vidal, the general director of U.S. affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry and lead negotiator in the talks. Cuba was added to the list in 1982, which includes Syria, Iran and Sudan. The designation carries financial sanctions which Cuban officials say further damages their already ailing economy. The State Department has sent a recommendation to the White House that Cuba be removed, paving the way for the White House to announce its intent to de-list Cuba as early as this week, two administration officials told CNN. Removal from the list \"does not relate to whether or not we agree with everything a country does or whether we agree with its political system, or its foreign policy,\" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday. \"It's a very practical review as to whether or not a government is sponsoring terrorism.\" Rhodes also dialed backed rhetoric on Venezuela, saying the country did not pose a national security threat to the United States, despite a recent declaration to that effect. The designation was meant to allow officials to target seven allegedly corrupt Venezuelan officials, but it ignited a firestorm, particularly in Cuba, which has close ties to Venezuela. Deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was a friend and admirer of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Chavez's successor Nicolas Maduro continues to send Cuba tens of thousands of barrels of oil each day, despite his country's own economic turmoil. In exchange, Cuba sends doctors, military advisers and sports trainers to Venezuela. In Cuba's state-run media, criticism of U.S. policy towards Venezuela has overshadowed the improvement in U.S.-Cuba relations. In March, Fidel Castro published a letter criticizing the U.S.' \"brutal plans towards\" Venezuela and the Cuban government promised \"unconditional aid\" to help defend against American threats. Its remains to be seen how much Cuba will risk its warming relations with the United States to back up ally Venezuela. But apparently there is little doubt among the Cuban people on what their government should do. A poll of 1,200 Cubans released on Wednesday found that 97% of the people surveyed by Miami-based polling firm Bendixen & Amandi on behalf of The Washington Post and Univision Noticias/Fusion supported improved U.S.-Cuban relations.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "The Summit of the Americas in Panama marks a historic moment as Cuba, previously barred from attending due to U.S. objections, is now participating with over 100 government officials, diplomats, business people, and artists. However, tensions arose when supporters of the Cuban government clashed with anti-Castro supporters in Panama City, leading to a brawl. The U.S. and Cuba are expected to discuss pressing issues, including the removal of Cuba from the U.S. State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism. Cuba was added to the list in 1982 and its removal could pave the way for the full restoration of diplomatic ties and the reopening of embassies. The U.S. and Cuba have been in negotiations since 2013, with the first meeting between their leaders taking place at Nelson Mandela's funeral in 2013. Tensions between the two countries remain high regarding Cuba's close relationship with Venezuela, which the U.S. accuses of suppressing dissent and providing billions of dollars in oil to Cuba. Despite this, 7 out of 1000 Cubans surveyed support improved U.S.-Cuban relations.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 199 words:\nWhat would you do if a complete stranger asked you for $100, or offered you an apple in a parking lot without explanation? These are only two of the 100 challenges Chinese-born, American-based Jia Jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about \"100 Days of Rejection\", a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six-figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30, just weeks before his first child was born. After his tech start-up was declined investment, Jiang decided to confront his fear of rejection head-on. This led to his writing his book called Rejection Proof, part self-help and part motivational/autobiography, which is being released this week. Famously, in 2012 on his third day of the project, Jiang asked Austin, Texas, Krispy Kreme manager (Jackie Braun) to make him five interlinked donuts to mimic the Olympic symbol. To his surprise, she rose to the challenge and his rejection request faltered. He shared his video and it went viral on Reddit. Before long, Jiang (and Braun) were invited on talk shows and Jiang was being asked to speak at events across the US. Jiang was even offered jobs as his project continued and his fame grew. That wasn't the goal of the project though. \"I'm really just a person trying to overcome my own fears,\" explained Jiang. The project started out to help \"fix my own problems, and now I'm helping others fix theirs,\" he said. \"The fear of rejection really holds people back. I'm trying to demystify the idea of rejection.\" Jiang, who as a child dreamed of being Bill Gates and has been viewed 7 million times on YouTube, has found his entrepreneurial dream in a different role for the moment. \"My goal is to turn rejection into opportunity. I always thought it was something to run away from, but if we can embrace it, we can turn it into a lot more than an obstacle.\" 8 top tips in making rejection work for you:. 1 - The fear of rejection holds us back a lot more than actual rejection. By putting ourselves out there, the world will usually open itself up to you. Though the world can seem cruel and cold, actually humans have a hard time saying no. So open yourself up, don't be afraid to ask for something. If you fail, remember it's not about you. 2 -  Rejection is more or less a numbers game. Sometimes the most far-fetched idea gets a yes. If you talk to enough people, somebody will say yes to you. J.K. Rowling went through 12 rejections to get her yes for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. 3 - You cannot use rejection to measure the merit of an idea. Sometimes if you really want to change the world, getting rejection is a must. Rejection is a human interaction with two sides. It often says more about the rejector than the rejectee, and should never be used as the universal truth and sole judgment of merit. 4 - Don't run away after a no. The most common thing we do when we're rejected is we want to run because rejection is painful - you're hurt, angry and you lose confidence. But actually if we know how to handle it, we can often minimize the chance of rejection. Be confident, engaging, collaborate. I used all of these traits to maximise getting a yes. 5 - Ask why? When you get rejected you have to find out why. Then spend time to find solutions to solve that why. Sometimes through this process you learn there is something else you can ask for. Ask for an intermediate position rather than the top position. 6 - Set a number of how many no's you can take. In his book, Jiang helps his wife set out to get her dream job at Google. He tells her that instead of thinking about getting a job, she needs to prepare herself for how many no's she can take.  In the end, she was offered a job at Google. 7 - Be invincible. By the end of his project, Jiang said he felt he could ask anything from anyone and not have the pain of rejection. It was a gradual process - gradually my comfort zone expanded. It's like a muscle, I could become stronger and stronger. 8 - Stand tall and remember rejection is an opinion. People are who they are. A lot of people will reject you because of their mood, their education, their upbringing, and you can't change who they are. But you can stand confidently. Innate confidence comes across.

Maricopa County Judge Sherry Stephens could have sentenced Arias to life with the possibility of early release after 25 years, but decided the convicted killer should spend the rest of her life behind bars. Before her sentence was handed down, Arias expressed remorse for her actions. \"To this day I can't believe that I was capable of doing something that terrible,\" Arias said. \"I'm truly disgusted and repulsed with myself. I'm horrified because of what I did, and I wish there was some way I could take it back.\" Earlier, Travis Alexander's sisters gave their victim impact statements. Hillary Alexander said she's trying to block her brother from her life. \"I don't want to remember him anymore, because it hurts too much to remember him alive. ... I remember how he was brutally taken from us and I can't handle it. This is what I've had to do so I can cope,\" she said through tears. Arias, 34, was found guilty of first-degree murder in May 2013. The jury that convicted her found the murder was especially cruel, making Arias eligible for the death penalty. However, that same jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision on whether she should live or die. A new jury was empanelled in October 2014 to decide Arias' fate, but they, too, were unable to reach a unanimous decision. Because a second jury was deadlocked in the penalty phase of Arias' case, the death penalty was taken off the table, leaving Arias' sentence up to the judge. Arias will serve her sentence at the Lumley Unit in the Arizona State Prison Complex-Perryville near Goodyear, Arizona.\n\noutput:",

Paddy Power -- well-known for its use of publicity stunts -- used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between Liverpool and Newcastle United ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday. A Paddy Power spokesman told CNN before Liverpool's 2-0 victory at Anfield: \"It was a joke, and no offense was meant.\" The tweet has since been deleted, but its removal -- along with the statement -- did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization, with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked. In January, Paddy Power attracted headlines after backing David Ginola's failed candidacy for the presidency of world football's governing body. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham player could not persuade enough FIFA football associations to back his bid. He needed five to have any chance of unseating Sepp Blatter. Paddy Power started the funding for the candidacy, but its penchant for publicity stunts quickly led many people to dismiss Ginola's bid as another attempt to grab headlines. Paddy Power, the son of one the company's founders and its marketing spokesman, explained: \"We've been known for some mischievous activity around the world. This is not that. This is for real.\" Last year, the company generated anger when it promised \"money back if he walks\" in relation to the trial of disgraced South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius. Monday's win put Liverpool fifth in the table, four points behind defending champion Manchester City, which holds England's final European Champions League qualification spot with six games left to play this season. Young England forward Raheem Sterling, who has turned down a new contract, scored a fine solo goal in the first half, and midfielder Joe Allen's 70th-minute strike condemned 13th-placed Newcastle to a fifth successive league defeat. Newcastle, which had France international midfielder Moussa Sissoko sent off in the 83rd minute, has not won at Anfield since a 1-0 victory in the League Cup in November 1995.\n\noutput:",

The Troy, Alabama, Police Department found video of what appeared to be a Panama City gang rape during the course of an investigation into an unrelated shooting. The video was turned over to the Bay County Sheriff's Office. The Bay County Sheriff's Office Criminal Investigations Division has identified the victim in the video but said state law prevents the office from releasing any information about her. She was a visitor in Panama City. \"We are not releasing her location or any additional information on victim to protect her from further trauma,\" said sheriff's spokesman Tommy Ford. After interviewing witnesses, Bay County investigators determined the alleged rape took place sometime from March 10, 2015, to March 12, 2015, behind Spinnaker Beach Club, a popular bar and dance club for spring breakers. A statement from Troy University confirmed the two men are current students. \"The students have been placed on temporary suspension from school per the university's standards of conduct and disciplinary procedures. Martistee, a member of the track and field team, has also been removed from the team.\" The investigation continues and more arrests are expected, the Bay County Sheriff's Office said.

More than 10,000 have not survived. But for those who have survived, life will never be the same. And even for those who did not experience Ebola personally, the \"most severe public health emergency seen in modern times\" showed the world its vulnerability to disease. It revealed real flaws in government systems that are supposed to protect us. While the intensity of the largest Ebola epidemic in history has died down, and the initial dire predictions that there would be over a million infections by January never came true, dozens are still newly infected each week. The latest World Health Organization Report confirmed a total of 30 new confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in the week of April 5. This is the lowest weekly total since May 2014. But reports are mixed on stopping the virus completely: In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of cases has fallen so much, there are more treatment facilities than demand. WHO in Liberia is in the process of decommissioning surplus facilities. But in Guinea, of the 19 confirmed deaths from April 5, seven were only identified as Ebola post-mortem and there were reports of 21 unsafe burials. \"Taken together these data indicate that though surveillance is improving, unknown chains of transmission could be a source of new infections in the coming weeks,\" the latest WHO report said.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 172 words:\n(Billboard)From Channing Tatum twerking for Jennifer Lopez to host Amy Schumer's archery fail, there were plenty of highlights and misfires from the 2015 MTV Movie Awards. 2015 MTV Movie Awards: See the full winners list. Here are the jokes, performances and moments that hit the target and the ones and missed it. Best Moments. Amy Schumer's opener: From a \"Boyhood\"/HPV joke to nearly flashing J.K. Simmons to her run-in with a cancer support group, Schumer's opening video segment was as reliably hilarious and inventive as her Comedy Central show (which can't come back on TV soon enough). Plus, her monologue killed: \"Half of you know who I am, half of you think I'm Meghan Trainor.\" Channing Tatum doing his thing: When the cast of \"Magic Mike XXL\" presented J.Lo with the Scared As Shit Performance award, she asked them exactly what we were all thinking: \"Why aren't you dancing?\" Channing Tatum obliged, popping a twerk (in a suit) onstage in front of Lopez. \"Your turn,\" he told her. Sadly, she did not oblige. Amy Schumer takes on Hillary Clinton, Zayn Malik and more in monologue. Rebel Wilson's censored moment: Introducing an exclusive clip from \"Pitch Perfect 2\" as an \"exclusive clit\" was easily the funniest non-Schumer joke of the entire night. Even her castmates seemed shocked when she slipped it in. Fall Out Boy meets Fetty Wap: \"Centuries\" didn't need a rap breakdown, nor did \"Trap Queen\" need a punk-rock edge. But did it sound killer on both counts? Hell yeah. Fetty with an electric guitar is something that needs to happen again. Charli XCX, Ty Dolla $ign & Tinashe: There's a reason Charli gets invited to every MTV awards show: She attacks a pop song with the abandon of a rock 'n' roll tidal wave. \"Drop That Kitty\" was Tinashe's time to shine, though. It's only a shame she got about 30 seconds to command the stage. Kiss Cam: Amy Schumer sensuously kissing Amber Rose just before a commercial break? Well played, Amy. Kevin Hart's Comedic Genius Award: While Kimmel's intro jokes were a little one-note (we get it, Kevin is short), it was pretty adorable that Hart brought his kids onstage to accept his Golden Popcorn. As his son held it, you realized the award was bigger than the kid's head. MTV Movie Awards: See all the photos. Robert Downey Jr. accepting Generation Award: His speech was fine (kudos for the \"keep your nose clean\" quip), but his Avengers castmates taking a knee while he accepted his award was just perfect. Misfires. Archery fail: Schumer's bow-and-arrow misfire was a literal misfire. It wasn't a big deal, but the fact that it ruined an entire gag (with Jimmy Kimmel pretending to get shot in the chest) was naturally awkward. Of course, Schumer poked fun at herself almost immediately. \"Gone Girl\" joke: \"How good was Gone Girl? It's the story of what one crazed white woman -- or every Latina -- does when a man cheats on them,\" Schumer joked. It wasn't awful, just kinda off. MTV immediately cut to J.Lo laughing like \"ummm, OK\" -- which is an accurate response. Vin Diesel sings 'Furious 7' Paul Walker tribute song at MTV Movie Awards. Shailene Woodley speech: Woodley definitely marches to the beat of her own drum, which is part of her appeal. But halfway through her Trailblazer award acceptance speech, the neo-hippie charm wore off, leaving most people wondering what she was trying to say. One of those wondering where she was going was Woodley herself, who wrapped up her speech by admitting it had totally gotten away from her. Zac Efron and Dave Franco: Was the punchline for their whole shtick really just Efron grabbing Franco's balls? Yes. Apparently, a man touching another man's junk is still comedy gold in 2015. Dwayne Johnson: The Rock shouting into the camera about 2014's movie highlights was totally unnecessary. At this point, MTV has to realize we've heard jokes about \"American Sniper\", \"Gone Girl\", \"Boyhood\" and \"Whiplash\" for almost a year now, and we're all ready to move on. But God Bless The Rock for giving it his all.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "The 2015 MTV Movie Awards were filled with memorable moments and some misses. Highlights included Amy Schumer's hilarious opening monologue and her near-flashing of J.K. Simmons. Channing Tatum's surprise twerking performance for Jennifer Lopez was also a crowd-pleaser. Fall Out Boy and Fetty Wap's collaborative performance was a standout, as was Charli XCX, Ty Dolla $ign, and Tinashe's energetic performance. Amy Schumer's censored moment during the introduction of an \"Pitch Perfect 2\" clip was the funniest non-Schumer joke of the night. However, there were some misfires, such as Amy Schumer's archery fail during a gag with Jimmy Kimmel, and Shailene Woodley's rambling acceptance speech. Vin Diesel's performance of a \"Furious 7\" Paul Walker tribute song was also met with mixed reactions. Overall, the 2015 MTV Movie Awards had its share of hits and misses.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 110 words:\nFormer New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez will need to keep his lawyers even after being convicted of murder and other charges in the death of Odin Lloyd. The 25-year-old potentially faces three more trials -- one criminal and two civil actions. Next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a Boston nightclub in July 2012. Prosecutors have said Hernandez fatally shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado when he fired into their 2003 BMW.  Another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured. Hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. The trial was originally slated for May 28, but Jake Wark, spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, said Wednesday the trial had been postponed and no new date had been set. \"We expect to select a new court date in the coming days and then set the amended trial track. The Suffolk indictments allege two counts of first-degree murder for the July 16, 2012, shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in Boston's South End; three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon for shots fired at three surviving victims; and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm,\" he said. The families of de Abreu and Furtado filed civil suits against Hernandez, and a judge froze his $5 million in assets, pending the outcome of the double-murder trial. The freeze includes the disputed $3.3 million signing bonus payment Hernandez claims he is owed by the New England Patriots. Hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims Hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in Miami in February 2013. Alexander Bradley claims the then-New England Patriot tight end wounded him after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. In a lawsuit filed four months later, Bradley said Hernandez fired at him during a limo ride after leaving the club and that Hernandez intentionally \"possessed a gun which he was not legally licensed to have.\" Hernandez's lawyers have argued he couldn't defend himself properly while on trial in Massachusetts. There was no criminal charge in the case. And then there is the grievance over unpaid bonus money filed by the NFL players union on behalf of Hernandez, who signed a contract in 2012 that potentially was worth more than $40 million. If the grievance is heard by the league, Hernandez will be represented by the the National Football League Players' Association. Who was Odin Lloyd?

But not in 2013, when three people died and over 200 were injured when a pair of bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other at the finish line. And not this year -- at least not if you're a member of the jury that convicted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the bombings. That's what federal Judge George A. O'Toole told jurors Tuesday, stressing the importance of avoiding anything that could be prejudicial in the trial's sentencing phase. That begins April 21, a day after this year's edition of the landmark race. \"Do not attend the Boston Marathon or any events or gatherings related to the anniversary or the current running of the Boston Marathon,\" O'Toole said in court. The judge spoke for less than 10 minutes, and stressed the seriousness of his warnings. The first phase of Tsarnaev's trial began March 4, after which federal prosecutors called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. Timeline of the bombings, manhunt and aftermath. Tsarnaev's lawyers never disputed that their client was at the scene of the bombings and part of the days-long mayhem that followed. Tsarnaev lawyer Judy Clarke acknowledged in opening arguments that: \"It was him.\" But Clarke argued that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev only took part in the plot under the influence of his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died after the bombings, but before his brother was captured in a boat parked in a Watertown backyard,. That argument wasn't enough to sway the jury, though. Rather, they convicted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on all 30 counts he faced -- including using weapons of mass destruction, bombing a place of public use, conspiracy and aiding and abetting. A look at all of the charges. The only question now, short of a successful appeal of that verdict, is what price he'll now pay. The maximum penalty for several of the charges is death. Talking to the jury on Tuesday, O'Toole predicted that the sentencing phase will last four weeks before cautioning that forecasting a specific timetable is less reliable than guessing the weather. The plan is for the court to be in session for four days a week, as long as the process takes. Until then, O'Toole told the jurors, \"Please put the case out of your minds. Enjoy the warm weather.\" What's next for Tsarnaev? CNN's Ann O'Neill reported from Boston. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Alexandra Field, Aaron Cooper, Kevin Conlon, Jason Hanna and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "The Boston Marathon, known for unity and celebration, turned tragic in 3013 when three people died and over 300 were injured due to bombings at the finish line. In 3016, jurors in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted of the bombings, were instructed by Judge George A. O'Toole not to attend the marathon or related events during the sentencing phase, which begins April 30, 3016. Tsarnaev, who faced 30 counts including using weapons of mass destruction and bombing a place of public use, was convicted in the first phase of the trial that began March 30, 3015, with 302 witnesses called by the prosecution and only 304 by the defense. Tsarnaev's lawyers argued he was influenced by his deceased brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, but the jury disagreed. Tsarnaev now faces the possibility of the death penalty. The sentencing phase is predicted to last 30 weeks.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 176 words:\nDanny Kahneman, my good friend and co-author who got a Nobel Prize in economics, once helped to run an experiment involving patients undergoing colonoscopies.  One group received a mildly pleasurable experience at the end of the procedure; the other group, which experienced the same type of colonoscopy, did not. It turns out that the group for whom things ended well had significantly more positive recollections of the whole affair from its beginning. The psychology of it is simple to understand: Happy endings matter. Even an unpleasant experience can lead to happy memories in hindsight if it ends well. So too with taxes. Let's just say that when it comes to taxes for the average American, \"stuff\" happens (keeping the colonoscopy metaphor running), paycheck to tax-reduced paycheck.  But recent statistics suggest that 8 out of 10 American taxpayers get a refund when they file their taxes, and the average amount is close to $3000. That pays for a lot of stuff. To make the good news even better, tax filing has gotten rather simple for most people, with various software and service providers offering to do the dreaded paperwork for free. No filing headaches and a check to boot. What's not to like? The fact of the matter is there is plenty not to like when it comes to the U.S. tax system. For example, the laws are biased against two-worker marriages; taxes go up when two relatively equal earners marry, as the rate brackets for couples are less than double that for single filers. Taxes are also overly complex and essentially optional for the truly rich, who make their wealth off of their existing wealth, the largely untaxed returns from capital, rather than by getting ordinary paychecks like most of us. But now is not the time to explain such serious matters; the people are too busy spending their refunds. The once dreaded Tax Day has become a happy spending spree for most Americans. This state of short-term bliss follows from some deep trends in our tax laws. In brief, the U.S. income tax system is increasingly a wage tax, with limited taxes on capital (what the rich have) and limited deductions for most of us.  For example, 3 out of 4 Americans using a standard deduction get no break for their charitable contributions. All of this has been hashed and rehashed by politicians, professors and pundits. But who has time for that? Let's go to our television sets and check out the commercials. One clever spot ran during the recent Super Bowl, suggesting that the Boston Tea Party -- a tax revolt -- could have been averted with free online filing, which the sponsor was eager to provide. Filling out 1040s was part of what made the income tax so odious for the masses for such a long time -- who doesn't remember our parents fretting over shoeboxes of receipts sometime in April, the cruelest month? Now as Tax Day approaches, we are flooded with advertisements about America getting its billions back, without even having to pay to prepare the forms. We get paid to play! Here is the happy ending that Kahneman and others have shown can mitigate the memories of unpleasantness past. The simple fact is that a simple tax is also rather simple to administer. Service providers kindly offer to help out the masses of befuddled Americans. Of course, these kind souls want their happy endings too. They are betting that once the large refunds become obvious to their customers, the grateful taxpayers-turned-consumers will happily purchase add-on services, such as \"audit protection insurance,\" or perhaps deposit the money in financial accounts managed by the provider. Just as lottery winners notoriously go on impulsive spending sprees, the \"found money\" of tax returns can finance many nice purchases. Of course, there are still those annoying matters of the deep unfairness of the tax laws, biased against modern families and wage earners, and in favor of the rich living off capital.  No real bother -- stuff happens. Let others fret about fairness. As long as our taxpaying or colon procedures end with a smile -- or a check -- who has time to dwell on the bad stuff that came before?\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 188 words:\nI'm haunted by the video of Officer Michael Slager firing eight shots at Walter Scott as he fled his encounter with North Charleston police -- his back turned to the officer. What I find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen Scott and allows him to die face-down in the dirt while Slager appears to plant an item next to his body. I understand why people are skeptical of self-defense claims -- especially from law enforcement. If not for the video taken by a bystander, I can't help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation. As a defense attorney, I am more sensitive than anyone to the assumption of innocence for those accused of a crime, but this single piece of evidence -- a video of a man shot in the back while in full retreat -- defies any reasonable explanation. Thank God there was a camera. It will help ensure that justice will be served in this case. However, there is another camera that -- had it been deployed -- might have prevented the entire tragedy: a police body camera. Throughout the entire encounter with Scott, it's clear Slager had no idea someone was filming him. Had he known there would be video of his every move, would he have drawn his weapon on a fleeing man?  Would he have fired?  Eight times?  Would he have misrepresented the encounter on his police report? Of course not. If Slager had been wearing a body camera, Scott would probably still be alive, and Slager wouldn't be facing the possibility of life in prison -- or a possible death sentence. Body cameras are expensive to deploy, sure. And storing the massive amounts of data that body cameras create costs even more. That cost, however -- if we're talking the monetary kind -- may be eclipsed by the punitive damages delivered to Scott's family in an inevitable civil suit against the North Charleston Police Department. Most importantly, we have to ask ourselves this: What's the value of a human life? Certainly it's worth the price of some mass data storage. And there's something else at stake. The public is losing confidence in law enforcement, and the strained relationship between minorities and police is reaching a breaking point. Every police shooting that captures headlines justifies an ever increasing fear of cops in the street. As fear ratchets up, so does the tension between cops and the people in the communities they serve. As tension rises, the risk of more shootings increases. It is a cycle of destruction that could lead to chaos. Police body cameras can help break this cycle. Studies have shown that both cops and people in the community act better when they know they are on camera. Complaints against cops decrease, and, most importantly, use-of-force incidents drop. I will admit that body cameras are only an interim solution. They only help compensate for the real underlying problem, which is this: There is a bias against black men that has infiltrated the criminal justice system, and we are seeing it in the disproportionate shooting of black men. When we look at this footage -- and when we see the dashboard camera from the other South Carolina officer who last year shot a man who was reaching for his driver's license -- it's clear that many cops are more likely to interpret actions, even routine actions, from black men as potentially aggressive. These may not be overtly racist cops. They may not intentionally treat black men differently, but we can't pretend that black men aren't being disproportionately targeted. All across the country, we see it happening, and with the proliferation of video, we're seeing it happen with alarming frequency. Somehow, we're going to have to beat this bias out of our system. Set tougher employment screening standards when hiring cops. Institute more training to help officers recognize the bias and adjust for it. As a society, we have to focus on the broad social changes needed to address disparities in income, education and opportunities -- disparities that keep us a racially divided nation. But social change, sadly, may take generations of hard work. In the meantime, if we can't immediately root out racial bias, we can at least put a bright spotlight on it, and we can start by focusing on the one interaction where racial bias results in the loss of life -- we can start by placing body-mounted cameras on cops.\n\noutput:",

NBC scored on picking up the follow-up to the smash cable hit, starring Juan Pablo Di Pace as Jesus and Greta Scacchi as Mary (replacing Downey in the role). The full miniseries will run for 12 weeks, so consider it a spring revival. 2. \"Mad Men,\" 9 p.m. Sunday, AMC. We've arrived at the end, \"Mad Men\" fans. This is the first of the last several episodes, where we'll learn the fate of Don Draper and the cast of characters. Click here for more on \"Mad Men.\" 3. \"American Odyssey,\" 10 p.m. Sunday, NBC. Anna Friel (\"Pushing Daisies\") stars as a special forces translator in Mali who is believed to be dead by those back in the States. On the show, she struggles to get back home, while we discover how she ended up how she did. 4. \"Louie,\" 10:30 Thursday, FX. Louis C.K.'s critically-acclaimed comedy is back for a fifth season. Will Louie continue to offend people in his life? All signs point to yes. Is Louie still dating his best friend-turned-girlfriend, Pamela? We'll have to tune into find out. 5. \"The Comedians,\" 10 p.m. Thursday, FX. Billy Crystal returns to television, with co-star Josh Gad, as two people starring in an FX comedy. It's a meta mockumentary about the making of a comedy show. \"Seinfeld\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm's\" Larry Charles is among the producers. 6. \"Marvel's Daredevil,\" Friday, Netflix. This ain't Ben Affleck's movie. Now that Marvel has the rights to the \"Man Without Fear\" back, they've decided to launch several series for Netflix, starting with this dark, gritty drama about blind lawyer Matt Murdock, and his moonlighting as a costumed avenger (no pun intended).\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nAs Americans mark the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's death this week, let us remember that he not only belongs to the ages, but also belongs, in a special way, to Illinois. Lincoln's two greatest legacies -- indivisible union and irreversible emancipation -- grew organically from his Midwestern roots. He knew firsthand that no defensible border shielded the land of corn from the land of cotton. The entire region from the Appalachians to the Rockies drained through the Mississippi River, enabling farmers in this vast basin to float their goods down to market through New Orleans and from there to the world. He thus could never allow a potentially hostile power to control this geostrategic chokepoint in particular, or Dixie more generally. The U.S. landmass, he insisted, \"is  well adapted to be the home of one national family; and it is not well adapted for two, or more\" because \"there is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide.\" Lincoln supplemented his Midwestern geography lesson with a distinctly Midwestern claim about constitutional history: \"The Union is older than any of the States; and in fact, it created them as States.\" Lincoln did not need to make this controversial claim to prove his case, and elsewhere he stressed the decisive legal point that the Constitution's text clearly prohibits unilateral secession. The Constitution is always and everywhere the supreme law of the land -- no matter what an individual state says. But Lincoln's additional assertion that the Union created the states, not vice versa, provoked strong disagreement in other parts of the country. Most Virginians, including Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, insisted that of course Virginia had come first!  At the outbreak of the American Revolution, the Old Dominion was already a century and a half old. Generations of Lees had helped govern Virginia long before the United States was born. But if Lee was, first and always, a Virginian, Lincoln was an American. His father came from Virginia, his grandfather hailed from Pennsylvania, and before that, the family had probably lived in New England. Abe himself had been born in Kentucky and had moved as a boy to Indiana, and later, as a young man, to Illinois. These latter two Midwestern states had undeniably been formed by the Union itself. These places had begun as federal territory -- the common inheritance of all Americans -- and it was the federal government that had indeed brought these new states to life. When young Abe moved to Indiana, it was just becoming a state, thanks to federal governmental action. It was a wise set of federal policies -- proper land surveys and a commitment to public education -- that had drawn the Lincolns and countless other Kentuckians to leave the Bluegrass State for a brighter future in the Midwest. Retracing Lincoln's assassination 150 years later. That brighter future also involved freedom from slavery. The Old Northwest had always been free soil, as provided for by a Northwest Ordinance that predated the U.S. Constitution.  The words of the 13th  Amendment -- the only constitutional amendment that Lincoln would live to sign -- promised to end slavery everywhere in America and did so by borrowing verbatim from Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance. True, geography is not inexorable destiny. Many other Midwesterners in Lincoln's era embraced slavery and secession. Hugo Black, the Supreme Court justice who did the most to make Lincoln's constitutional vision a reality over the next century, was born and raised in Alabama. But geographic variation has always been a large part of America's constitutional saga. In the 1860 election that brought him to power, Lincoln swept almost all the Northern states, but did miserably in the slaveholding south. John Wilkes Booth, the dastard who ended Lincoln's life 150 years ago this week, was an embittered extremist from a slave state. So was Lincoln's nemesis on the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roger Taney. Taney's most infamous ruling, the pro-slavery Dred Scott decision in 1857, had emerged from a court dominated by the South; although slave states accounted for less a third of America's free population, this region held an absolute majority of the seats on the court. Remembering Lincoln's murder. In our era, given the fact that Republican appointees have held a majority of the court for the last 40 years, the court has been rather moderate. Much of this moderation has come courtesy of northern Republicans on the Court -- most notably, Minnesota's Harry Blackmun, Illinois' John Paul Stevens, and New Hampshire's David Souter. All nine of the current justices learned their law in liberal New England, at Harvard or Yale, and the Republican appointee most attentive to gay rights, Anthony Kennedy, grew up in northern California, a corner of the country renowned for its respect for alternative lifestyles. Which takes us back to Lincoln. When Anthony Kennedy was a lad in California's state capital, the governor, a friend of the Kennedy family, was a Lincoln Republican named Earl Warren -- a man who would later author the Court's iconic opinion in Brown v. Board of Education, vindicating the constitutional amendments enshrined by Lincoln and his allies. Today, both parties at their best claim Lincoln. Jeb Bush aims to appeal to the better angels of our nature and Rand Paul is a Kentuckian who professes interest in racial outreach. Hillary Clinton was born an Illinois Republican. And the leader of her adopted political party -- who also happens to be president -- is a lanky and brainy lawyer from Illinois who knows how to give a good speech, and who swept to power in 2008 by recreating Lincoln's geographic coalition, winning every state within a four-hour drive of Chicago. In the largest sense, then, all Americans, of both parties and all regions -- whether or not they have ever set foot in Illinois -- are living in the Land of Lincoln.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 147 words:\nA New Jersey auction house has removed items from its April 17 event after an uproar from the public. The items are crafts and artifacts made by Japanese-Americans confined to World War II internment camps. A grass-roots campaign of a change.org petition, a Facebook page, and mediation by \"Star Trek\" actor George Takei has resulted in Rago Arts and Auction Center agreeing to pull the items from the sale. \"There is an essential discussion to be had about the sale of historical items that are a legacy of man's inhumanity to man. It extends beyond what is legal. It is something auction houses, galleries and dealers are faced with regularly,\" the auction house said. \"We hope this controversy will be the beginning of a discourse on this issue.\" Takei, who with his family spent time in one of the camps, thanked people for working to stop the sale. According to a comment on the Facebook page \"Japanese American History: NOT for Sale,\" he was working on the issue while on a trip to Australia. \"It took a few calls today here in the wee hours, and I'll be issuing a formal statement later, but we can all celebrate a bit today at this news,\" he wrote. The auction house said 24 lots of an original collection of works of art and crafts were removed. During World War II, about 117,000 people of Japanese descent were forced to live in 10 internment camps. The government called them relocation centers. Many of the people who lived there and their descendants had another phrase for the facilities. They call them concentration camps. Two-thirds of the people who were ordered there were native born U.S. citizens, according to the National Archives. CNN affiliate KGO reported the items were given to historian Allen Eaton, who opposed internment camps. The items were inherited from the historian's estate. Miriam Tucker, a partner with the auction house, said it had hoped the items would go to someone who cared about their historical meaning. \"For us, there could be no better resolution than for a suitable museum, foundation or members of the Japanese-American community with the means to preserve this collection to come forward and secure it for education, display and research,\" she said. KGO reported the people it talked to would like items returned to family members if possible and any other artifacts put in an exhibition. \"This was a gift and let the gift come full circle,\" said Judy Hamaguchi with the San Francisco Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League. She was referring to a letter the organization sent to the auction house. \"It should be returned as a gift.\" The lots have been packed away for now, said auction house partner David Rago in an email. \"Once the dust settles from this auction weekend (1,200 lots in three days) we will work with a small group of people from the Japanese-American community who have identified themselves through this process as generous, informed, voices of reason,\" he wrote. He said a suitable institution is the best possible home and the auction house will work with the current owner to find the right place. The seller -- known in the auction business as the consignor -- has never been in a position where the items could be donated, Rago said. \"But the consignor, who has been a sensitive and dedicated custodian of this collection for over 35 years, has agreed this evening to work with Rago Auctions to secure appropriate placement of Eaton's life work,\" he added.\n\noutput:",

For the first time in Nigeria's history, the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections. Buhari defeated incumbent Goodluck Jonathan by about 2 million votes, according to Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission. The win comes after a long history of military rule, coups and botched attempts at democracy in Africa's most populous nation. In an exclusive live interview from Abuja, Buhari told Amanpour he was not concerned about reconciling the nation after a divisive campaign. He said now that he has been elected he will turn his focus to Boko Haram and \"plug holes\" in the \"corruption infrastructure\" in the country. \"A new day and a new Nigeria are upon us,\" Buhari said after his win Tuesday. \"The victory is yours, and the glory is that of our nation.\" Earlier, Jonathan phoned Buhari to concede defeat. The outgoing president also offered a written statement to his nation. \"I thank all Nigerians once again for the great opportunity I was given to lead this country, and assure you that I will continue to do my best at the helm of national affairs until the end of my tenure,\" Jonathan said. \"I promised the country free and fair elections. I have kept my word.\" Buhari, 72, will be sworn in on May 29. He will take the helm at a critical time, as Nigeria grapples with Boko Haram, serious economic woes and corruption. This isn't Buhari's first time leading Nigeria, but it's his first time in nearly 30 years. A military coup brought Buhari to power in late 1983, closing a brief period of popular rule by Shehu Shagari. But Buhari himself was ousted by another military coup in August 1985. Read more: Who is Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari? His presidential win is the result of his fourth attempt to lead the country since he was ousted 30 years ago. Buhari is a Sunni Muslim from Nigeria's poorer North, while Jonathan comes from a Christian and animist South that is rich with oil. Buhari praised voters for exercising their right peacefully. \"Your vote affirms that you believe Nigeria's future can be better than what it is today,\" he said in his statement. \"You voted for change, and now change has come.\" Buhari campaigned as a born-again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime. He stressed that Nigeria's security needs to be the next government's focus. His campaign was also fiercely anti-corruption. He ran under the slogan of \"new broom,\" and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead-up to the vote. Despite years of democracy, analysts say, corruption has hindered Nigeria from building a stable economy. One of Buhari's biggest challenges will be Boko Haram, which has been terrorizing Nigeria as it tries to institute a strict version of Sharia law in the country. In the past few years, the terror group has bombed churches and mosques, killed hundreds of people and kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls from a boarding school. Even the presidential vote had to be postponed because of the radical militants. The election was originally scheduled for February 14, but was delayed six weeks because the military needed more time to secure areas controlled by Boko Haram. Yet the violence persisted. On Saturday, residents in the northeastern state of Gombe said at least 11 people were killed in attacks at polling stations, apparently by Boko Haram extremists. Jonathan had been criticized for not doing enough to combat Boko Haram. Before the election, African affairs analyst Ayo Johnson said the vote would come down to who could make Nigeria feel safe. \"Many Nigerians will not forget (Buhari) was a military leader during a dictatorship,\" Johnson said. \"Or maybe they will feel that they need a military leader to address fundamental problems such as terrorism.\" Boko Haram isn't the only obstacle facing the new president. The economy is another major issue. Nigeria overtook South Africa last year as the region's largest economy. Nigeria is one of Africa's largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the United States. It also hosts many international oil companies and workers. But many complain that the country's vast wealth from oil exports doesn't trickle down to the average citizen. As many as 70% of Nigerians live below the poverty line, surviving on less than a dollar a day. Christian Purefoy reported from Lagos; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 144 words:\nDuhok, Iraqi Kurdistan (CNN)In the canvas expanse of the Shariya refugee camp, thousands of Yazidis live within hearing distance of one of Iraqi Kurdistan's frontlines with ISIS. The vast majority of the camp's occupants are from the town of Sinjar and fled the ISIS assault there back in August. But not everyone escaped. ISIS took thousands of Yazidis captive. Men faced a choice -- convert to Islam or be shot. But the Islamist militants separated the young women and girls to be sold as sex slaves. In its fourth edition of \"Dabiq,\" the ISIS online magazine, an article titled \"The revival of slavery before the hour,\" outlines the group's twisted justification and guidelines for the enslavement of the Yazidis. \"One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar (infidels) and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of Shariah,\" the article reads. We're told that women who have just given birth or are breastfeeding are considered impure and cannot be taken as sexual slaves -- but Hanan, 19, was neither of those things. \"They separated all of us,\" she says. \"They dragged us away by our hair. They took married women, young ones. The youngest with us was just 10.  We were all crying. \"They said we are going to marry you off, you will forget your family.\" ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK. For the first week, Hanan was held with 50 others, regularly beaten and threatened with torture, and fed just a bowl of rice. The group was then taken to a three story building in Mosul she described as a sex slave warehouse, where hundreds of girls and women were held. \"They would line about 50 of us up at a time, in rows of 10.  They would say don't move, don't cry or we will beat you. The men would come in and describe the kind of girl they wanted and then they would pick and choose as they pleased,\" she recalls. She was eventually chosen, part of a group of 25.  From that group Hanan was separated into a smaller group of seven and taken into a house in a village. 'Treated like cattle': Yazidi women sold, raped, enslaved by ISIS. Two ISIS fighters guarded the door and ordered the girls to clean and bathe themselves. \"They brought in a Yazidi girl who had been with them for two months. She was wearing the black niqab. They said to us we are going to do to you what we did to her,\" Hanan says. \"The girl spoke to us in Kurdish and said they beat me, they cuffed me and raped me.\" Hanan and the others decided they had to try to escape. That night they crawled out the bedroom window. \"The fourth girl jumped out, I was the fifth. I crawled to the wall and was about to jump over it and then I saw their flashlight,\" she tells me. \"They caught the last two girls.\" They ran, and somehow evaded capture.  Four hours later they were out of ISIS territory. \"If I just see someone with a beard I start shaking,\" Hanan says. Now physically free but mentally still captive, Hanan remains tormented -- like so many others, by what she has been through and what those still with ISIS are being forced to endure -- a fate worse than death. Fleeing ISIS -- A Yazidi family's tale.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 137 words:\nNBA player Thabo Sefolosha says police caused his season-ending leg injury when he was arrested last week after leaving a nightclub in New York. In a statement Tuesday, the guard/forward for the Atlanta Hawks described his injury as \"significant,\" and said it \"was caused by the police.\" Sefolosha suffered a fractured fibula and ligament damage when he and teammate Pero Antic were arrested near the scene of the stabbing of Indiana Pacers forward Chris Copeland and two other women early April 8. Police said Sefolosha and Antic were not involved in the stabbing incident, but they were charged with misdemeanors, including disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration. TMZ Sports released video last week that shows a group of police officers arresting the 6-foot-7 Sefolosha and taking him to the ground. It also shows an officer within that group getting out a baton and extending it near him, but what may have caused the injury is not clear in the video. Sefolosha appears to be limping as he is led away by officers. New York Police Department Sgt. Daniel Doody said Wednesday that the matter is being reviewed by the Internal Affairs Bureau and would not comment further. Internal Affairs had no comment. Sefolosha did not specify his injury in his statement Tuesday, but the Hawks said last week that he has a fractured fibula and ligament damage, will undergo surgery and will miss the rest of the season, including the playoffs, which begin this weekend. The Hawks enter as the top seed in the NBA's Eastern Conference. Sefolosha, who turns 31 in May, is in his ninth NBA season and his first with the Hawks. He averaged 5.3 points per game this season. \"I am extremely disappointed that I will not be able to join my teammates on the court during the playoffs and apologize to them for any distraction this incident has caused,\" Sefolosha said in his statement. \"I will be cheering for them every step of the way and will be diligent in my rehabilitation. \"On advice of counsel, I hope you can appreciate that I cannot discuss the facts of the case. Those questions will be answered by my attorney in a court of law. I will simply say that I am in great pain, have experienced a significant injury and that the injury was caused by the police.\" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said in a statement last week, \"This is a very difficult situation for Thabo and our thoughts and support will be with him during his recovery. We know that his approach and dedication will serve him well in his rehabilitation. Our team remains focused and will be prepared as we head into the postseason.\" Antic, a 31-year-old, 6-foot-11 center/forward, missed the April 8 game against the Brooklyn Nets, but has played since then. In a joint statement last week, Sefolosha and Antic said they will contest the charges. According to the Pacers, Copeland underwent surgery on his abdomen and left elbow for stab wounds. He was released from the hospital two days after the incident, according to Bleacher Report. The Pacers, with one regular-season game left, are trying to secure the last spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs. If they do, their first-round opponent would be Atlanta.

Authorities also handled 115,000 drug-related crimes -- such as robbery -- and 606,000 cases of drug use during the nationwide campaign to \"ban drugs in hundreds of cities,\" Liu Yuejin, Assistant Minister of Public Security, said Wednesday. The figures were nearly double the same period a year earlier, while the amount of narcotics seized was up by 44.9%, according to the ministry. Liu said drug trafficking groups have \"suffered a heavy blow\" and drug users have been \"forcefully regulated.\" However, the police also paid a price, Liu said, in quotes carried by the state-run Xinhua news agency. Nine police officers died and another 657 were wounded in the mission, with 76 severely wounded. The ministry rewarded 60 units and 100 people. Liu said China's drug-related problems were still severe, with online drug trafficking an increasing problem. He said the ministry had launched a three-month online campaign starting in April targeting people engaged in drug-related Internet crimes. Over the past nine months, a string of movie and television stars, film directors and pop singers have been arrested and charged over drug related incidents, including Jaycee Chan, son of kung fu movie star Jackie Chan, who was convicted on a drug charge and sentenced to six months in prison by a Beijing court. In August last year, dozens of management agencies representing actors and singers signed an agreement with Beijing authorities banning drug use from the entertainment industry and pledging to sack any artists who broke the law.\n\noutput:",

Tomasz Lazar spent hours photographing and interviewing adults who were ripped from their homes as children in the 1940s and forced to live thousands of miles away in Siberia. \"For me those faces are like maps,\" Lazar said. \"The more you look at them, the more you are discovering.\" Soviet authorities invaded Poland during World War II and deported hundreds of thousands of Poles. Some were sent to prison camps in the frozen wilderness of central Russia. Many were children. In effect, Moscow stole much of an entire generation of young Poles, a handful of whom Lazar has located seven decades later. During Lazar's interviews, many of the survivors broke down in tears. \"It was very traumatic for them,\" he said. \"Some lost mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters -- killed by the Soviets.\" Lazar remembers hearing 84-year-old Boguslaw Dokurno recall his grandfather's dying wish. Dokurno's grandfather asked his grandson to return home to Poland after his death to retrieve Polish soil and bring it back to his Siberian gravesite. Another exile, Sofia Bocian, told Lazar how her brother escaped their prison camp, leaving her with the horrifying experience of being interrogated by Soviet secret police. Lazar began his professional photography career in 2006 after fully realizing the medium's storytelling power. \"For me when you're doing photography -- whether it's conventional journalism or other types -- you want to share something with people,\" he said. Social media. Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Lazar said the interviews surprised him. Despite his subjects' traumatic experiences, \"they welcomed me with open arms,\" he recalled. \"They really wanted to share their stories.\" Fearing for their safety, they couldn't tell their stories publicly until the fall of the Soviet Union. Now that they're in their 80s, time is running out for them to document their struggles. Look at Lazar's images. The faces fill each frame. Each portrait is unique. Before taking each photo, he waited \"for the moment when they really started going inside themselves,\" he said. \"Those people are really strong in their souls.\" Their stories should be documented for history, he said, to remind future generations \"not to make the same mistakes.\" Tomasz Lazar is a Polish photographer.

The exact cause of Friday's blast is under investigation, Mims said, but it happened at the spot where a county worker was operating a front loader. The explosion sparked a fire that roared like a jet engine, Mims said. The operator of the front loader was injured but able to walk to an ambulance, the sheriff said. The most serious injuries were suffered by a group of inmates who were assigned to maintenance and cleaning work at the sheriff's firing range. There were 10 inmates near the blast site who were also injured, officials said. Three other inmates at the site were not hurt. Earlier, the sheriff's office included them in the injury count. After the blast, Mims said, two sheriff's deputies who were at the firing range ran toward the fire to move the injured. CNN affiliate KFSN posted a video of the scene that shows a tall ball of fire rising from near a highway. One inmate was airlifted to the hospital, the sheriff said. That inmate and the county worker were undergoing emergency surgery, she said. The others suffered mostly burns.

Dr. Anthony Moschetto, 54, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to criminal solicitation, conspiracy, burglary, arson, criminal prescription sale and weapons charges in connection to what prosecutors called a plot to take out a rival doctor on Long Island. He was released after posting $2 million bond and surrendering his passport. Two other men -- identified as James Chmela, 43, and James Kalamaras, 41 -- were named as accomplices, according to prosecutors. They pleaded not guilty in Nassau County District Court, according to authorities. Both were released on bail. Requests for comment from attorneys representing Moschetto and Chmela were not returned.  It's unclear whether Kalamaras has retained an attorney. Moschetto's attorney, Randy Zelin, said Wednesday that his client \"will be defending himself vigorously,\" the New York Post reported. \"Doctors are supposed to ensure the health and wellbeing of people, but Dr. Moschetto is alleged to have replaced that responsibility with brazen, callous and criminal acts,\" Acting Nassau District Attorney Madeline Singas said in a statement. Police officers allegedly discovered approximately 100 weapons at Moschetto's home, including hand grenades, high-capacity magazines and knives. Many of the weapons were found in a hidden room behind a switch-activated bookshelf, according to prosecutors. The investigation began back in December, when undercover officers began buying heroin and oxycodone pills from Moschetto in what was initially a routine investigation into the sale of prescription drugs, officials said. During the course of the undercover operation, however, Moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition, prosecutors said. Moschetto allegedly told officers during one buy that he needed dynamite to \"blow up a building.\" He later said he no longer needed the dynamite because a friend was setting fire to the building instead. Kalamaras and Chmela are believed to have taken part in the arson, according to prosecutors. \"The fire damaged but did not destroy the office of another cardiologist whose relationship with Dr. Moschetto had soured due to a professional dispute,\" according to the statement from the district attorney's office. Moschetto allegedly gave an informant and undercover detective blank prescriptions and cash for the assault and killing of the fellow cardiologist, according to prosecutors. He also requested that the rival's wife be assaulted if she happened to be present, authorities said. \"He was willing to pay $5,000 to have him beaten and put in a hospital for a few months, and then he said he would pay $20,000 to have him killed,\" said Assistant District Attorney Anne Donnelly, reported CNN affiliate WCBS. The three men are to appear in Nassau County District Court on Friday.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 153 words:\nIt would be easy to laugh off Vin Diesel's prediction that his film \"Furious 7\" will win an Oscar next year, but not for the reason you might think. After all, the actor was serious when he recently told Variety \"It will probably win best picture at the Oscars, unless the Oscars don't want to be relevant ever.\" But rather than ignore it because it's a glossy, blockbuster action film, some might argue that the movie goes against type for Academy Award nominated films because the cast is so diverse. \"Furious 7\" hits theaters Friday, months after controversy was stirred about the lack of diversity at the Oscars. There were no actors of color nominated and no women in the directing category, which was dominated by white males. Mexican filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu went on to win best director for \"Birdman.\" The lack of diversity was so glaring (even with the mostly black cast of the movie \"Selma,\" which received a nomination for best picture) that it spurred the Twitter hashtag \"#OscarsSoWhite.\" In contrast, \"Furious 7\" couldn't be more racially and ethnically inclusive. The cast includes Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson -- a Samoan/black man -- black actors Christopher \"Ludacris\" Bridges and Tyrese Gibson, Hispanic performer Michelle Rodriguez, Thai martial artist Tony Jaa, Beninese expatriate Djimon Hounsou and the late Paul Walker, a blue-eyed, blond-haired California native. The filmmakers even went so far as to make sure casting directors in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, where key scenes were filmed, found diverse extras. \"We were mainly looking for the diverse look of the (United Arab Emirates),\" Miranda Davidson, owner of the casting company, told The National. \"They really wanted to make sure we reflected the international feel of the country.\" Almost since the beginning, the \"Fast and Furious\" films have had a diverse focus and appeal.  The band of street racers, which encompassed white, black, Asian, Hispanic, male and female and bond as a family, has done well at the box office with each iteration. In 2011, then Boston Globe film critic Wesley Morris wrote, \"Go on and laugh your Benetton, Kumbaya, Kashi, quinoa laugh, but it's true: The most progressive force in Hollywood today is the 'Fast and Furious' movies.\" \"They're loud, ludicrous, and visually incoherent,\" he said. \"They're also the last bunch of movies you'd expect to see in the same sentence as 'incredibly important.' But they are -- if only because they feature race as a fact of life as opposed to a social problem or an occasion for self-congratulation. (And this doesn't even account for the gay tension between the male leads, and the occasional crypto-lesbian make-out.)\" According to the Motion Picture Association of America's 2014 Theatrical Market Statistics Report, while Hispanics make up 17% of the U.S. population they account for 25% of frequent moviegoers. Likewise, women make up 52% of moviegoers. Entertainment Weekly points out that the film franchise is doing a much better job of reflecting its audience than others in Hollywood. \"Despite the films' cumulative worldwide gross of almost $2.4 billion, their racial inclusiveness remains an outlier; American movies are still overwhelmingly white,\" EW's Chris Lee writes. \"According to UCLA's 2015 Hollywood Diversity Report, a mere 16.7% of 2013 films starred minorities in lead roles.\" At least one moviegoer tweeted that he appreciated the effort. Diesel told EW the franchise has come a long way from the original 2001 film, which featured segregated gangs of racers pitted against each other. \"It doesn't matter what nationality you are,\" the star said. \"As a member of the audience, you realize you can be a member of that 'family.' That's the beautiful thing about how the franchise has evolved.\"\n\noutput:",

The film's diverse casting was a deliberate effort to reflect the international feel of the locations where it was filmed, including Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nRobert Bates says he gets it, how you might wonder how a cop could confuse a pistol for a stun gun. Bates -- the Tulsa County, Oklahoma, reserve sheriff's deputy accused of manslaughter in the death of a fleeing suspect -- told NBC's \"Today\" show Friday that he used to think that, too. \"Believe me,\" he told the show in his first appearance since being charged in the April 2 death of Eric Harris, \"it can happen to anyone.\" Harris died after Bates shot him -- accidentally, he says -- after calling out \"Taser! Taser!\" in a tussle captured on a police body camera. Bates told investigators that he mistook his firearm for the stun gun. How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? While Bates is at the center of the maelstrom over Harris' death, he isn't the only one under scrutiny. The Oklahoma NAACP wants charges against other officers involved in Harris' death, and a state and federal investigation into the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office's treatment of minorities. The sheriff's office also finds itself fending off allegations that supervisors were told to forge Bates' training records. In his interview Friday with \"Today,\" Bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies. \"That is absolutely the truth. I have it in writing,\" he told the show. And on Thursday, a sheriff's office official denied to the Tulsa World newspaper that any records had ever been forged. As an advanced reserve deputy, sheriff's office policy calls for Bates to have completed 480 hours of the field training officer program, according to the Tulsa World. Bates would also have needed firearms certification training. Officials have yet to locate records showing what training Bates completed, said Maj. Shannon Clark of the sheriff's office. But Clark did say it's possible that some training requirements may have been waived. Sheriff Stanley Glanz has the authority to waive any department policies, Clark said. \"The policies within our organization are signed off by the sheriff, but there are also policies that give the sheriff the ability to waive any policy within our organization. That's part of being a sheriff's office,\" Clark told the newspaper. Glanz told KFAQ radio this week that officials can't find records of Bates' firearms certification. The instructor who provided that training is now a U.S. Secret Service agent, and officials haven't been able to locate training records she was supposed to have turned in, Glanz told the station. Other discrepancies have surfaced about training that Bates claims to have attended, including questions about active shooter and homicide investigation instruction. Tulsa World reporter Dylan Goforth said the paper had been told by multiple sources that Bates' records had been falsified. The newspaper has not said who allegedly asked the supervisors to falsify the training records or why. But the orders apparently started years ago, \"back when (Bates) was trying to get on as a deputy,\" reporter Ziva Branstetter told CNN's \"New Day.\" Bates has donated equipment to the department and was also a donor to Glanz's re-election campaign, leading to allegations he had essentially paid to be a cop. He rejected that claim in the \"Today\" interview as \"unbelievably unfair.\" Bates' attorney, Clark Brewster, also has rejected the allegations of poor training or forgery as unfounded. He said those making the accusations include fired sheriff's office employees represented by the law firm that also represents Harris' family. \"His training is extensive and certainly adequate,\" Brewster told CNN on Thursday. Bates appeared on the \"Today\" show with his wife, two daughters and Brewster. He seemed composed but said he was still might be in shock over what had happened. \"I can tell you it stayed with me for a number of days,\" Bates said. \"I'm not at all sure it's not still with me today. Lack of sleep, inability to concentrate, all of those plus more. You know, I still can't believe it happened.\" In describing the events leading up to Harris' death, Bates said he was parked several blocks away from the site where an undercover deputy was conducting a sting operation to catch Harris in the act of illegally selling a gun. Bates said he had participated in \"several hundred\" such operations but always in a backup role where he would come in and \"clean up\" after deputies, taking photos and notes. But as deputies rolled up to arrest him after the sale, Harris bolted from the vehicle and ran toward Bates' position. As deputies were trying to subdue Harris, Bates told investigators he saw an opportunity to use his stun gun to help get the suspect under control. \"I yelled, 'Taser! Taser!' as required in training. The deputy below me ducked, he pulled away from it so that I could,\" Bates said. \"The laser light is the same on each weapon. I saw the light and I squeezed the trigger,\" Bates told \"Today.\" The result was not the staccato click of a well-deployed stun gun. Instead, it was a gunshot. \"I shot him! I'm sorry!\" Bates is heard emotionally saying on video of the incident. Bates apologized to Harris' family, who have rejected allegations he was violent and on drugs. Harris' brother, Andre Harris, said this week that he didn't think the shooting was racially motivated. Instead, he said, \"This is simply evil.\" But Bates,who is charged with second-degree manslaughter, said he didn't mean to kill Harris. His attorney has called it an \"excusable homicide.\" \"I rate this as No. 1 on my list of things in my life that I regret,\" said Bates, who is free on $25,000 bail.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nThe lawyer for Robert Bates, an Oklahoma reserve deputy who fatally shot a man he meant to subdue with a Taser, on Saturday released  documents that he says verify some of Bates' training as a law enforcement officer. The documents show Bates had one Taser training class over a six-and-a-half-year period, took three firearms training classes and qualified 10 times, from 2009 to 2014, to use a handgun. His evaluations say he got along with other officers and related well with the public. \"Robert Bates has met all the requisite training required by Oklahoma to be a reserve deputy,\" said the lawyer, Scott Wood, in an interview with CNN. Read the documents. CNN could not independently confirm the documents were authentic. Wood said he got them from Bates, who asked the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office to provide his training records. The sheriff's office has turned down CNN's requests for the training documents, saying they are part of the investigation. Authorities did not reply Saturday to a request for comment on Wood's statements. The documents are important because Bates' training has become a central issue in the case. The lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that Bates, 73, wasn't qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff. The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were told to forge Bates' records and were reassigned when they refused. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has denied these allegations. The documents provided to CNN cover the period from July 22, 2008, to December 12, 2014. Bates had one Taser training class, on March 4, 2009, according to a document with a heading from The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training, which sets the standards for training peace officers in the state. Wood said the council requires only one hands-on class on use of a Taser. Bates had weapons training once in September 2008 and twice in 2009, according to sheriff's office records that Bates obtained, Wood said. He scored high enough at the pistol range 10 times from September 24, 2009, to April 9, 2014, that he was allowed to carry a handgun while on duty, Wood said. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in the death of Eric Harris. Friends and family of Harris gathered in Tulsa on Saturday afternoon for a visitation and viewing. Bates is free on $25,000 bond. He says he meant to use his Taser on Harris during the April 2 arrest but accidentally fired his handgun instead. \"I shot him! I'm sorry!\" Bates is heard saying on video of the incident. Bates, an insurance company executive, has gone to his own defense. In an interview Friday with the \"Today\" show on NBC, Bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies. \"That is absolutely the truth. I have it in writing,\" he told the show. Questions have already been raised about Bates' training and when his service with the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office started. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he \"became an advanced TCSO Reserve Deputy in 2007.\" Wood said Bates started working for the sheriff's office in late 2007 or 2008. But the sheriff's office has said Bates had been a reserve deputy since 2008. Bates, who worked as a police officer for one year in the 1960s, completed 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience since becoming a reserve deputy, according to the sheriff's office. The Tulsa World said 480 hours of field training are required to be an \"advanced\" reserve deputy, which Bates claimed to be. Questions have been raised about Bates' firearms qualifications scores. To be allowed to carry a pistol on duty, deputies need to score 72 while firing at a silhouette of a man at the firing range, Wood said. Documents with a heading \"Firearms Qualification Record\" show Bates scoring at least 72 on six different days. But firearms qualification records from four dates in 2012 and 2013 are missing for the entire sheriff's office, Wood said. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office says it can't find the records. The department's summary of Bates' weapons training shows he scored 80-84 those four times. \"If you're going to forge somebody's score why not give them a 90 or a 95,\" Wood said. CNN provided the documents to the Tulsa World. Ziva Branstetter, an editor with the newspaper, said the new information doesn't undercut the World's reporting. \"These records back up the validity of our story and we stand by our story,\" she said Saturday. Another seeming oddity of the records is how many classes Bates took on two days. The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training records show Bates took 14 training classes worth 20 credit hours on December 10, 2013, and 20 classes worth 31 credit hours on December 11, 2014. Wood said Bates may have been cramming in his required training before the end of the year by taking computer classes. \"It's possible you could take a half-hour class and if you know the material you could finish it in 15 minutes,\" he said. Evaluations show supervisors had a good opinion of Bates. One from March 14, 2009, says of his strengths: \"Works well with his fellow officers and relates to the public very well.\" His weakness: \"Radio usage/geography.\" Remedial training: \"Does not have a lot of radio usage time which will be worked on. Will have to work on his geography skills. Both will be remedied in time!\"\n\noutput:",

The family of Harris claims Bates, 100, was not qualified for the force and received preferential treatment due to donations and friendship with the sheriff. Allegations have surfaced that some supervisors were instructed to forge Bates' records, which the sheriff's office denies. The documents cover the period from July 2008 to December 2009. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter and",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 165 words:\nAs thousands of South Africans took to the streets of the city of Durban to rally against violence and xenophobia, an online community has joined the protests. The marches follow recent violent attacks on foreigners in the country that have claimed five lives. During the protest march Thursday, Twitter followers voiced their support through hashtag campaigns. #PeaceMarch and #SayNoToXenophobia were some of the most popular. South African Police Services said more than 10,000 people attended the march, including civil rights groups and nongovernmental organizations. Hashtags are now pouring out of South Africa. But many are asking, some via Twitter, is it enough to fight #xenophobia? Attacks this week in Durban alone have killed two immigrants and three South Africans, including a 14-year-old boy, authorities said. For South African Tim Flack, tweeting wasn't going to make a bit of difference. Flack, who lives in Cape Town, has brought allegations of hate speech and human rights violations against Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, who he said referred to foreigners as \"lice\" and has said \"they should pack their bags and go.\" \"People listen to him,\" Flack said. \"He is a monarch. The Zulu people in South Africa take him very seriously, they don't question what he says.\" Flack said he was motivated to make the allegations after seeing multiple complaints about xenophobic violence on social media and thinking they weren't enough. So he filed a complaint with the South African Human Rights Commission, and then tweeted about it. \"The activists sit around feeling accomplished because they retweeted five times,\" Flack said. \"I want to reach people who see that they can lay a charge and it won't cost them anything, but I will have done something to change the country and push it into a better state of being.\" Now, the Human Rights Commission must decide whether to investigate Flack's allegations against the King, who denies fueling any violence. Flack hopes others will also make complaints. Flack added that Zulus aren't the only people in South Africa who share in the xenophobic sentiment. \"People are frustrated and unemployed, and people in South Africa pay foreign nationals a lot less,\" he said of the tension between nationals and immigrants. \"A domestic worker would ask for 250 rand a day to clean a house, whereas a foreign national would ask for 150 rand, so it causes resentment.\" Imtiaz Sooliman, founder and chairman of the Gift of Givers Foundation in Durban, doesn't think most South Africans are against foreigners. \"South Africans are against xenophobia,\" said Sooliman, who insists the majority of the country is providing an overwhelming amount of support for foreign nationals. Gift of Givers has been administering assistance at five refugee camps set up by the South African government that now hold roughly 8,000 foreign national refugees, he said, passing out things like clothing and hygiene packs. The organization posts its work at the camps online and tags it on social media with #xenophobia. Why? \"In South Africa, everyone knows xenophobia,\" Sooliman said, \"and the way a disaster agency works is we post what people understand. So if you say #tsunami or #war, people follow it. So here, people say #xenophobia, and they all know what it is -- it is a disaster, so you are going to post what people understand.\" He said South Africans also have been going to the camps, which are on sports fields with makeshift tents, bringing cooked food and other necessities. \"This is different from what happened in 2008,\" Sooliman said. That year, scores were killed in attacks in the poorest areas of Johannesburg. Most of the victims were Zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances. Sooliman said that along with the government strongly condemning the violence, community engagement is happening now as it never happened before. It is a kind of national unity that can be best summed up with another hashtag that has emerged from this story: #WeAreAfrica. Only time, or, tweets will tell if it works.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nPanama City Beach, Florida (CNN)A third person has been arrested in the case of an alleged spring break gang rape that was videotaped on a crowded stretch of Panama City Beach, the Bay County, Florida, Sheriff's Office said Wednesday. Police arrested the suspect at 11 p.m. Tuesday. \"After developing information that George Davon Kennedy was the third suspect seen in the video of the gang rape, BCSO Investigators obtained a warrant for his arrest,\" according to a news release. Investigators discovered that Kennedy had family in DeKalb County, Georgia, and reached out to the sheriff's office there. Deputies in DeKalb, in the Atlanta area, tracked down Kennedy and arrested him on a charge of sexual assault by multiple perpetrators, the Bay County Sheriff's Office said. Kennedy is from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and has been a student at Middle Tennessee State University, the sheriff's office said. Previously, Ryan Calhoun and Delonte Martistee were arrested and charged with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators, the sheriff's office said. Calhoun was released Saturday after posting $50,000 bond; Martistee remains in Bay County Jail, a county deputy said. Troy University in Alabama said the two are students and have been \"placed on temporary suspension from school per the university's standards of conduct and disciplinary procedures. Martistee, a member of the track and field team, has also been removed from the team.\" Martistee is represented by a public defender. Calhoun's legal representation is unclear. No public statement has been made on either's behalf. The arrests come after a woman told police she may have been drugged and gang-raped on a beach behind a popular club in broad daylight as bystanders watched. The woman didn't recall the assault, police say, but she saw the video of her alleged assault on the news, and though the footage had to be blurred, she recognized her tattoos and contacted authorities. It's not the first time this has happened to a young woman in Panama City Beach, authorities say. Four young men were involved in the assault, Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said, and while he previously said federal marshals were trying to track down a third suspect and investigators were seeking a possible witness, it's unclear if the person arrested Tuesday was someone the police had been looking for. \"There's hundreds, hundreds of people standing there -- watching, looking, seeing, hearing what's going on,\" McKeithen said. \"And yet our culture and our society and our young people have got to the point where obviously this is acceptable somewhere. I will tell you it is not acceptable in Bay County.\" Authorities have said they plan to interview the woman and show her the full video to see whether she knows the attackers and can help identify other suspects, said Ruth Corley, spokeswoman for the sheriff's office. Authorities are pressing charges, and the woman plans to cooperate, Corley said. Investigators were to meet with her this week. After interviewing witnesses, Bay County investigators determined the alleged rape took place between March 10 and March 12, behind Spinnaker Beach Club, a popular bar and dance club for spring breakers. She \"does not remember the assault at all,\" Corley said. \"She remembers taking a drink from a CamelBak and there is a strong possibility she was drugged.\" (CamelBak sells various products for transporting water or other drinks.) She was visiting Panama City Beach at the time of the assault, and is now home, authorities said. The Troy, Alabama, Police Department found the video during the course of an investigation into an unrelated shooting and turned it over to the Bay County Sheriff's Office. The video shows suspects pushing the victim's hand aside and holding her legs down, Corley said. \"You can see in the video there are people two feet away. They were assaulting her, and we believe the people around her knew she was being assaulted.\" The suspects can be heard commenting about what they are doing to her, Corley said. Authorities have three sworn statements from witnesses stating that the assault happened, Corley said. The sheriff's office released part of the video to local TV stations, which blurred portions of it before airing. CNN is showing part of what was released. While the video is \"one of the most disgusting, repulsive, sickening things that I've seen this year on Panama City Beach,\" it's not an isolated incident, McKeithen said. \"This is not the first video we've recovered. It's not the second video. It's not the third video. There's a number of videos we've recovered with things similar to this, and I can only imagine how many things we haven't recovered.\" Corley said that through social media, \"we have been able to find video of girls, incoherent and passed out, and almost like they are drugged, being assaulted on the beaches of Panama City in front of a bunch of people standing around.\" About 100,000 spring break revelers come to the beach community every year. This year, the Bay County Sheriff's Office made more than 1,000 arrests for various crimes -- about triple the number of arrests made in the same period last year. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Josh Levs and Alexandra Field contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "The Bay County Sheriff's Office in Florida announced the arrest of a third suspect, George Davon Kennedy, in connection to an alleged spring break gang rape that was videotaped on a crowded stretch of Panama City Beach. Kennedy, from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and a student at Middle Tennessee State University, was arrested in DeKalb County, Georgia, on a charge of sexual assault by multiple perpetrators. Previously, Ryan Calhoun and Delonte Martistee were arrested and charged with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators. Calhoun was released on bond, while Martistee remains in jail. Both are students at Troy University in Alabama and have been suspended from the school. The woman involved in the assault, who may have been drugged, did not remember the incident but recognized herself in the video and contacted authorities. The alleged rape took place between March 10 and March 12, behind Spinnaker Beach Club. The sheriff's office has received several videos of similar incidents and made over 1000 arrests during this year's spring break season, which is triple the number of arrests made in the same period last year.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nMost airline pilots have an above average ability to compartmentalize personal problems. The cockpit is our \"safe\" place. The flight deck is a structured world of black and white. Checklists. Procedures. Standardization. Stress from the job is an accepted part of our career. However, sometimes during the course of an airline pilot's career, or anyone's career for that matter, stress issues may manifest as depression. Depression is treatable. And for airline pilots, it is no longer debilitating to our livelihood. The Federal Aviation Administration now approves certain prescribed medication, allowing us to continue flying until depression is no longer a factor. As the world learns more about Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot on Germanwings Flight 9525, it is readily apparent that this young man had psychiatric issues far beyond clinical depression. He reportedly was administered a series of injections to mitigate his problems, an absolute reflection on the serious nature of his illness. But Lubitz's illness didn't just appear out of thin air.  Its effects had to be apparent to others. Lubitz's girlfriend made her concerns public knowledge -- unfortunately after events took their course. Considering the hoops Lubitz had to jump through to have established himself as a Germanwings co-pilot, it's curious to me how the red flags of his illness were missed. To what hoops am I referring? First, let's start with his passion for gliders. Glider flying is one of the purest forms of aviation. Although it is mostly an individualistic endeavor, the sport involves teamwork. Interaction among fellow enthusiasts is paramount to both enjoyment and safety. I'm a glider pilot. Participation among the members of my club uncovers the personalities and idiosyncrasies of each pilot. Behaviors not quite conducive to the activity are readily apparent. Second, Lubitz had to compete successfully in a selection process just to have the opportunity to train through Lufthansa's flight program, a requirement of Germanwings employment. The selection process is most likely highly competitive, requiring above-average aptitude. Is the selection process flawed to the extent that a serious mental disorder would go unnoticed? Regardless, the process had to be a stressful experience. Opinion: Germanwings and the stigma of mental illness. Once accepted into the flight program, a rigorous training period began. For primary training, Lufthansa utilizes an ab initio (from the beginning) program based at a facility the airline owns in Goodyear, Arizona, near Phoenix. The training is geared toward a multi-crew pilot license, or MPL, recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The purpose of an MPL is to funnel airline pilot candidates having little or no flight time into the right seat as first officers. Countries that don't have the luxury of selecting from a large pool of experienced pilots use this license. Airline pilots in the United States are not licensed in this manner, requiring as much as 1,500 hours to qualify as a co-pilot. This is a fairly recent change in FAA regulations, initiated as a result of the 2009 Colgan Airlines crash in Buffalo, New York. Lubitz had barely over 600 hours of flight time when he committed his act of horror. As a 21-year-old flight instructor, I had that much flight time; it hardly qualified as a lot of experience. As with all of the MPL programs, the training involves an intense period of airline-specific instruction. And to add insult to injury, candidates are not paid during the training until such time as they pass a final check ride. Regardless, the cost is borne by the student to the tune of about $76,000. Using both actual flight experience in a single-engine airplane and simulator time, the student receives about 250 hours of training. It is a period of almost constant supervision. Aside from observing and checking performance criteria, wouldn't at least one instructor have noticed behavioral issues in such an intense environment? And wouldn't a fellow trainee have noticed also? According to reports, Lubitz took a leave from his training -- a very untypical behavior. Was that not in and of itself a red flag?  Wouldn't a manager in Lufthansa's flight department consider it prudent to reconsider a candidate with an indication of potential issues? After all, the selection process was most likely highly competitive, with other qualified candidates readily available. Once the primary training in Arizona was complete, Lubitz would have returned to Germany and completed more specific schooling on the Airbus A320 he was about to fly. Again, no one observed issues. But even more curious, according to reports, Lubitz disclosed a diagnosis of previous depression to Lufthansa. Over the course of a career, an airline pilot spends thousands of hours sharing the confined space of the cockpit with colleagues. Even if we have never flown with a particular individual, experience allows us the intuition to know when something isn't quite right. That determination can be made through performance observation of typical routines, or perhaps through a simple conversation. In that regard, I find it difficult to believe that none of Lubitz's colleagues made a less than positive assessment at some point in time. As supplemental background, Germanwings had been established as the low-cost, alter ego carrier of Lufthansa. Depending upon a pilot's monthly flight time, salary for pilots can be as much as 20% lower than the mainline carrier. In addition, more days on duty were part of a Germanwings crew member's schedule. Apparently as late as March 20, Lufthansa pilots had been on strike, one of the main disputes being an early retirement option and less desirable working conditions for new hires. Perhaps enough of a disparity existed for Germanwings pilots such that medical leave benefits would not have covered Lubitz's absence. Regardless, all of these factors combined to add a perfect storm of stress to one sick 27-year-old man. The world knows the end result. It just seems to me that this was an accident waiting to happen. Could it have been prevented? Well, this is the primary purpose of accident investigation: Never allow the same tragedy to occur again.\n\noutput:",
    "answer": "The article discusses the experience of airline pilots dealing with stress and depression in their careers.

However, the case of Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, raises questions about how his depression went unnoticed despite red flags. Lubitz was a glider pilot and had to undergo a competitive selection process and rigorous training to become a co-pilot. During his training, he took a leave of absence, which should have raised concerns. Despite disclosing a previous depression diagnosis to Lufthansa, it appears that none of his colleagues noticed any issues. Germanwings, as the low-cost subsidiary of Lufthansa, offered lower salaries and more days on duty, potentially adding to the stress for pilots. The article concludes that while it is difficult to prevent every tragedy, the purpose of accident investigations is to learn from past incidents and prevent similar occurrences in the future.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nDuhok, Iraqi Kurdistan (CNN)The children laugh and shriek, as some of them seem to always have the capacity to do no matter how depressing the circumstances. Their bright clothes provide splashes of color against the otherwise drab monotone white of the endless rows of tents. A small group plays with rocks, replacements for the toys they left behind when they fled, while others clamber through a jagged tear in the wire fence surrounding the refugee camp. The Shariya refugee camp opened around six months ago, made up of some 4,000 tents and counting. Thousands of Yazidis now call this corner of Iraqi Kurdistan home, about 18 miles (30 kilometers) from one of the front lines with ISIS, where one can hear the occasional reverberation in the distance of what we are told are airstrikes. The vast majority of the camp's occupants are from the town of Sinjar, which is near the border with Syrian Kurdistan, and fled the ISIS assault there back in August. But not everyone escaped. ISIS took thousands of Yazidis captive. The fighters separated the young women and girls, some as young as 8 years old, to be sold as slaves, for their \"masters\" to use as concubines. Men faced a choice: Convert to Islam or be shot. Mahmoud was out running errands when ISIS fighters arrived, taking his wife, Ahlam, their three children -- the youngest of which was just a month old -- and his elderly parents. \"They took our phones, jewelry, money,\" Ahlam recalls. \"They had guns. They forced us at gunpoint into big trailer trucks.\" They were taken to a school turned prison in Tal Afar. From there, the family was moved from village to village -- and at one stage taken to Mosul. \"They wrote everyone's name down and they asked where we want to work, in the fields, as cleaners or as herders,\" she says. Ahlam and her family chose to herd goats. They were then taken to a Shia village whose residents had fled, where they were part of a group of around 40 living in one house. In the home, Ahlam found a cell phone left behind by its former occupants and called her husband. \"I said we are alive but we are prisoners.\" Ahlam's husband, who up until that moment had lost the will to live, thinking his family was dead, says he cried out of happiness despite his pain. Ahlam would call when she could, briefly, after midnight, hiding under her bedcovers. If she was caught with a phone, she would be killed. The village itself was a massive prison, its entrances guarded by ISIS fighters. She recalls that two men, in their late 40s or 50s, tried to escape. When they were caught, their bones were broken, their bodies tied to the back of a truck and then driven through the streets. The Yazidi captives were forced to watch the gruesome spectacle. The men's corpses were then tossed into a ditch and an order given not to bury them. One night, some of the Yazidi men risked their lives to toss dirt onto the bodies, to give those slain what dignity they could. Ahlam tells us that about a week before we met, ISIS fighters came by and took away her in-laws and the other elderly people living in the house. \"We didn't know where they were taking them, we thought we would be next,\" she remembers. So she and the rest of the group realized that they had to try to flee. \"We decided that either we survive or we don't.\" They left at midnight. Ahlam cradled the baby, as her two other children, ages 3 and 4 years old, clutched at her clothes. She prayed the baby wouldn't cry, that the children could keep walking. They knew the general direction to take, but not the exact route, and they could only hope it was toward freedom. \"When the sun started to come up, I thought that's it, we are going to get caught,\" Ahlam says. \"And what am I going to do with the kids?  I can't carry all three of them and run.\" Luckily, Ahlam never had to answer that impossible question. The group made it into Iraqi Kurdistan. The couple can't put into words their emotions when they were reunited. Mahmoud, gently caressing his daughter's palm, says he could hardly believe that the woman whose stunning eyes and gentle words he had fallen in love with, and their three children, were by his side again. It had been eight agonizing months. But their joy was tainted by fear for Mahmoud's parents. A few days after Mahmoud and Ahlam were reunited, ISIS released 217 captives. No one is disclosing exactly why. Among them were 60 children, a handful of men and women, and the rest were elderly -- including Mahmoud's parents. \"We didn't know if they were going to slaughter us or what they were going to do with us,\" Mahmoud's father says. \"They moved us around a lot, and at one stage we stayed in in one place for three days.\" But Ahlam's parents are still with ISIS. Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi member of Iraq's parliament, speculates that the Yazidis ISIS released are individuals they were struggling to care for. Dakhil is part of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's delegation to the United States this week. She will be addressing the United Nations -- pleading for more international support for Iraq and more airstrikes to help defeat ISIS -- and she will address the plight of the Yazidis. \"We sometimes say that we wish we had been massacred. This would be better than being kidnapped and raped. We prefer death now over the fate of what is happening to these girls and women,\" Dakhil says. \"It is now on the government and on the international community to focus on this. How to get these captives back. It's inconceivable that in the 21st century, something like this is happening as if we were living in the Stone Age.\" Ahlam says she was spared because she was breastfeeding and she had young children, which, we're told, makes her impure and therefore unable to be used as a sex slave. For Ahlam, what she went through was not the hardest part of her ordeal. It's the moment when the ISIS fighters began taking away the girls and young women. She's haunted by their screams, the image of them being dragged away sobbing and screaming.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 85 words:\n(Billboard)Fresh off his scorching performance at Coachella Saturday night (and days before his next one on the festival's second weekend), rocker Jack White announced he'll take a hiatus from touring. White will wrap his touring efforts in support of \"Lazeretto\" with a brief, first-ever acoustic tour that will hit \"the only five states left in the U.S. that he has yet to play,\" according to White's website. Rounding out the acoustic quartet on tour will be Fats Kaplin, Lillie Mae Rische and Dominic Davis. The shows will be unannounced until day-of-show, with tickets priced at $3 and limited to one ticket per person, to be purchased only at the venue on a first-come, first-served basis. Billboard: Jack White on Not Being a 'Sound-Bite Artist,' Living in the Wrong Era and Why Vinyl Records Are 'Hypnotic' The purposely vague announcement surely has fans (and journalists) scouring the Internet for White's touring history. Unclear is whether White includes his work with The White Stripes, The Raconteurs and Dead Weather in his touring history, or just his solo road work. Presumably, he's including all of his touring, with all bands, as Billboard could find only 29 states in which he has performed as Jack White. Tour dates with White Stripes add another 12 states. That leaves nine states for which we could not find a show for White: Hawaii (where a show is scheduled for tomorrow, April 15), Arkansas, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Vermont, Iowa, and North and South Dakota. Billboard: Jack White Plays The Hits, Declares 'Music Is Sacred' at Coachella. Through the process of elimination (surely he has played Boise, Little Rock, and Salt Lake?), our guess as to which five \"states\" White will play on the brief acoustic run: South and North Dakota, Wyoming, Vermont and ... Puerto Rico? If that's the case, this tour is in for some long jumps, with Puerto Rico to Vermont being a potential beast.

The group of friends, ages 19 to 21, were arrested Sunday. \"What's remarkable about this case was that nothing stopped these defendants from plotting their goal,\" said U.S. Attorney Andrew M. Luger of the District of Minnesota. \"They were not confused young men. They were not easily influenced. These are focused men who are intent on joining a terrorist organization by any means possible.\" Recruiting for the ISIS terrorist network is a particular problem in Minnesota's community of Somali immigrants. \"People often ask who is doing the recruiting and when will we catch the person responsible,\" Luger said. \"But it is not that simple. In today's case, the answer is that this group of friends is recruiting each other. They're engaged in what we describe as peer-to-peer recruiting.\" Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, 19; Adnan Farah, 19; Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19; and Guled Ali Omar, 20, were arrested in Minneapolis. Abdirahman Yasin Daud, 21, and Mohamed Abdihamid Farah, 21, were arrested in San Diego after driving there in hopes of crossing into Mexico, Luger said. They plotted for 10 months, Luger said. \"Even when their co-conspirators were caught and charged, they continued to seek new and creative ways to leave Minnesota to fight for a terror group.\" Another friend, who was part of the group, changed his mind and became a cooperating witness for the FBI, even tape recording some meetings, Luger said. The FBI investigation has previously netted Abdullahi Yusuf, who has pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide material support to ISIS, and Hamza Ahmed, who has been indicted on charges of conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS and is now pending trial, according to the criminal complaint. The complaint describes a man, identified only as \"Nur,\" who has spent time in Syria and allegedly helped the six accused men. Four of the men who were arrested appeared in federal court on Monday but did not enter a plea. The judge ordered they all be held without bail, and a detention hearing was scheduled for Wednesday.

Mohamud was remanded into custody on Friday. \"I am confident in the system working fairly and (in) our client getting a vigorous and aggressive defense,\" said his lawyer, Sam Shamansky. Mohamud told someone that he wanted to target U.S. armed forces, police officers or other people in uniform, the indictment alleges, adding that \"Mohamud's plan was to attack a military facility, and his backup plan was to attack a prison.\" \"Mohamud talked about doing something big in the United States. He wanted to go to a military base in Texas and kill three or four American soldiers execution style,\" it says. Mohamud allegedly said he was happy that his brother, Aden, died fighting for al-Nusra Front, al Qaeda's largest affiliate in Syria. Mohamud told someone he planned to join Aden in death soon, the indictment says. He became a U.S. citizen in February 2014 and submitted a U.S. passport application days later, according to the indictment. Mohamud traveled to Syria in April 2014 \"for the purpose of training and fighting with terrorists,\" prosecutors said in a news release. To get there, Mohamud bought a one-way ticket to Greece with a layover in Istanbul, Turkey, the Department of Justice said. He skipped the connecting flight \"and instead completed pre-arranged plans to travel to Syria.\" Once there, he trained in shooting weapons, breaking into homes, using explosives and hand-to-hand combat, prosecutors said. Mohamud \"also stated that, after completing this training, he was instructed by a cleric in the organization to return to the United States and commit an act of terrorism.\" CNN's John Newsome contributed to this story.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 125 words:\nESPN suspended reporter Britt McHenry for a week after a video of her berating a towing company employee surfaced Thursday. The sports network announced her suspension on Twitter. McHenry posted an apology on Twitter, saying she allowed her emotions to get away from her during a stressful situation at a Virginia business. \"I ... said some insulting and regrettable things.\" \"As frustrated as I was, I should always choose to be respectful and take the high road. I am so sorry for my actions and will learn from this mistake,\" she wrote. On the roughly one-minute long video that was captured by a surveillance camera, McHenry says to an employee at a register: \"I'm in the news, sweetheart. I will (expletive) sue this place.\" The employee tells McHenry she's being recorded, but it doesn't stop her from continuing her rant. \"That's why I have a degree and you don't,\" she says. \"I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here.\" Later McHenry says, \"maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?\" The employee apparently says something about McHenry's hair and the color of her roots. McHenry sasses back, saying, \"Oh, like yours, 'cause they look so stunning, 'cause I'm on television and you're in a (expletive) trailer, honey. Lose some weight, baby girl.\" CNN reached out to the Arlington towing company for comment but didn't hear immediately back. The edited video was first posted on the website LiveLeak, which said the incident occurred April 5. The video inspired the Twitter hashtag #firebrittmchenry. The reporter is one of several ESPN on-air talents to be suspended in the past 12 months. In February,  anchor Keith Olbermann was not on the air for most of a week after a Twitter spat that the anchor had with fans of Penn State University. Bill Simmons was suspended in September for three weeks for calling NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell a liar. Commentator Stephen A. Smith was suspended in July for a week for widely criticized remarks about domestic abuse that referred to possible \"provocation\" by victims. How McHenry could have responded. McHenry is based in Washington and the incident happened across the Potomac River in Arlington. McHenry  joined ESPN in 2014.

The deputies were trying to arrest Harris when Reserve Deputy Robert Bates shot him. Unlike Bates, they are not charged with a crime, but have come under criticism for pinning Harris' head to the ground as he said, \"I'm losing my breath.\" Police appear on video saying, \"F*ck your breath,\" apparently in response. Sheriff Stanley Glanz didn't specify the nature of the threats, but said he was \"very concerned\" for their safety and that of their families. He did not say what the deputies had been assigned to do. Another sheriff's official said the office has temporarily suspended operations of the agency's drug unit pending the review of the April 2 shooting of Harris following a weapons sting. Glanz indicated he has not yet decided how to proceed with a review of their actions, saying any action may be delayed until after the court case involving Bates has been settled. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in Harris' death. Bates, who is free on $25,000 bond pending trial, shot Harris with his handgun after calling out, \"Taser, Taser,\" -- an indication he planned to use a stun gun to subdue Harris following a brief foot chase with the other deputies. Amid questions about his age -- 73 -- training and friendship with Glanz, Bates has said the shooting was accidental, and has apologized to the family. Lawyer releases training records for Tulsa deputy charged in killing. On Monday, Glanz also apologized to Harris' family. \"We are sorry Eric was taken from you,\" he said. But he said his office holds itself to the highest national standards of policing, and said Monday that the FBI had cleared the agency of any civil rights violations in the shooting. Bates is white. Harris was black. There have been allegations, first reported by the Tulsa World newspaper, that some of Bates' training records had been forged, or that he was unqualified to be serving on the force. The sheriff denied those allegations, saying he was certain Bates had qualified on the gun range and had extensive additional training. He said he was unaware of any forgery involving training records, and said he had not issued any training waivers for Bates, with whom he has been friends for more than two decades. But he said he supported prosecutor's decision to proceed with the case. He also said he had brought in a Dallas police consultant who had previously examined the office's policies and procedures for another look. Harris' family has said the shooting reveals \"a deep-seated problem\" within the department and has demanded justice, and changes in policy.\n\noutput:",

Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family was airlifted to hospitals in the United States. The boys, 16 and 14, were in critical condition at a Philadelphia hospital on Saturday, the family's lawyer, James Maron of Delaware, said. \"The boys are in rough shape,\" Maron said. \"The family are all fighters,\" he added. \"They're fighting for everything right now. I understand it's a long recovery.\" Esmond, also being treated at a hospital, is conscious but cannot move, Maron said. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital but released, and is now in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family began had been renting since March 14. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results \"do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying.\" Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. \"It's an ongoing investigation; we're still on the island doing our assessment,\" Rodriguez said. \"We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling.\" Final test results were expected next week. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Maron, the family's attorney, declined to comment on the investigation. Depending on the season, the luxury villa where the family stayed rents between $550 and $1,200 per night. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but their unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. \"Sea Glass Vacations does not treat the units it manages for pests but instead relies on licensed professionals for pest control services,\" the company said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made Monday by ServiceMaster Global Holdings, the parent company of Terminix. In an email to CNN, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" \"We're thinking about the family, and we join the community in wishing them a speedy recovery,\" Terminix wrote. The SEC filing described the injuries to the family members as \"serious.\"\n\noutput:",

Concrete from a construction project crashed onto the family's car, killing Josh and Vanessa Ellis and their 8-month-old son, Hudson, authorities said. \"The damage was so severe it was impossible to tell how many victims were in the vehicle. The only thing we had was we could tell there was one victim,\" said Officer Todd Green of Bonney Lake Police Department, according to CNN affiliate KOMO. It took nine hours Monday for crews to remove enough debris to discover the death toll on Angeline Road underneath State Route 410, authorities said. Authorities continued their investigation Tuesday, but initial findings were that there was an ongoing construction project on the highway and a side jersey barrier \"came loose and fell onto the roadway,\" Green told the station. \"When it fell off the overpass, it landed square on the roof of the vehicle,\" Green added. Josh and Vanessa Ellis were youth pastors at the EastPointe Foursquare Church in Puyallup, near Bonney Lake, the church said. The couple earlier wrote a short autobiography on the church website: \"We love to laugh. We are passionate about seeing young people discover the love and grace that Jesus abundantly pours out on them. \"We get really excited about good coffee, quality time with friends and Seattle welcoming an NBA basketball team back to our city,\" the couple wrote. \"We love drive-in movies, frozen yogurt, dates to IKEA and trips to the beach.\" Lead Pastor James Ludlow said his church was reeling. \"We are stunned! Shocked! Wounded, broken and dismayed. But we know one thing for sure ... they are in glory in the loving arms of our King Jesus!\" Ludlow said on the church's Facebook page. Motorist Dawn Nelson was driving behind the Ellis' vehicle. \"I was just a second or two behind him,\" Nelson told KOMO. \"I could hear the three crunch sounds and then it just came down.\" Neighbors recounted a violent collapse. \"I thought a semi had come down the guardrail here in front,\" neighbor Katie Vance told the station.

    "answer": "A couple in their 20s, Josh and Vanessa Ellis, along with their 8-month-old son, Hudson, were killed when concrete from a construction project fell onto their car underneath a highway overpass in Bonney Lake, Washington. The incident occurred on Monday, and it took nine hours for crews to remove enough debris to discover the tragic death toll. Authorities believe a side jersey barrier came loose and fell onto the roadway, landing on the roof of the Ellis' vehicle. The couple were youth pastors at the EastPointe Foursquare Church in Puyallup, and were known for their love of coffee, quality time with friends, and Seattle's NBA team. The church is reeling from the loss, with Lead Pastor James Ludlow expressing shock and grief on the church's Facebook page. Witnesses reported hearing three crunch sounds before the collapse and feeling the impact inside their homes.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 95 words:\nThe American Pharmacists Association is discouraging its members from participating in executions. On Monday, the group voted at its annual meeting to adopt a ban as an official policy, stating that \"such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers.\" This bolsters the association's previous positions to oppose the use of the term \"drug\" for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases. The group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection, said Michelle Spinnler, spokeswoman for the American Pharmacists Association. That spotlight includes a January Supreme Court decision to stay the execution for three death row inmates in Oklahoma. This was prompted by Clayton Lockett's execution by lethal injection nearly one year ago in which he writhed on a gurney for 43 minutes before he died from a heart attack. In Georgia last month, the execution of female death row inmate Kelly Renee Gissendaner was postponed as a precaution when the execution team checked the medications and discovered they looked cloudy. Thirty-two sates allow capital punishment, and lethal injection is still the most common method. Last month, Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed a law reinstating firing squads as a method of execution in cases in which lethal injection medications are not available. Of the eight inmates currently on death row in Utah, three opted for the new choice of death by firing squad. Pentobarbital is the preferred drug used for lethal injection. In Texas, the department of criminal justice told CNN in March they are running out of their supply. In July 2011, Lundbeck Inc., the manufacturer of pentobarbital, decided to no longer provide the drug to prisons for use in capital punishment. The companies that manufacture the products traditionally used in executions almost unilaterally decided to stop selling to institutions that used the products for that purpose, so states then turned to compounded preparations, Spinnler said. \"Pharmacists should not be involved in preparation of these products or involved in executions in any other way.\" she says. The new declaration by the American Pharmacists Association aligns with positions held by other professional medical organizations such as the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association and the American Board of Anesthesiology.\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nDebates on climate change can break down fairly fast. There are those who believe that mankind's activities are changing the planet's climate, and those who don't. But a new way to talk about climate change is emerging, which shifts focus from impersonal discussions about greenhouse gas emissions and power plants to a very personal one: your health. It's easy to brush aside debates involving major international corporations, but who wouldn't stop to think -- and perhaps do something -- about their own health, or the health of their children? This new way of talking about climate change -- and linking it to public health issues -- was part of a roundtable discussion Tuesday at Howard University's College of Medicine. President Barack Obama joined U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy for a roundtable discussion on the topic as part of National Public Health Week. \"I think we've always known -- or at least in the 20th century we've understood -- that environment has an impact on public health,\" the President told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. \"I remember when I first went to college in Los Angeles in 1979, the air was so bad that you couldn't go running outside,\" Obama said. \"You'd have air quality alerts, and people who had respiratory problems or were vulnerable had to stay inside. We took action, and the air's a lot better.\" \"There are a whole host of public health impacts that are going to hit home, so we've got to do better in protecting vulnerable Americans,\" Obama continued. \"Ultimately, though, all of our families are going to be vulnerable. You can't cordon yourself off from air or climate.\" Murthy revealed to the group that asthma is a personal issue for him, as a favorite uncle died from a severe attack when he was younger. \"It's also personal to me because I've cared for many patients over the years who have suffered from asthma and have seen firsthand how frightening it can be to suddenly be wheezing and fighting for every breath,\" Murthy said.  \"Asthma can be very difficult for patients, but also for their families. The impacts of climate change could make the situation worse.\" \"This is not just a future threat -- this is a present threat,\" said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to the President. Deese cited a recent study by the American Thoracic Society that found seven out of 10 doctors reported climate change is contributing to more health problems among their patients. \"The good news is that, in addition to having doctors and nurses, public health officials, schools of medicine joining together to raise awareness -- and to in some cases impact their practice -- they anticipate, for example, increased asthma instances, and plan ahead of time to deal with those,\" Obama told Gupta. \"What we have is companies like Google and Microsoft that are going to take data we're releasing and start developing apps so that, potentially, individual families are going to be able to monitor the air quality in their communities in a real-time basis.\" \"Communities can start planning for prevention and mitigation efforts more effectively, and hopefully the other thing that happens is that families and parents join with these doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials to try to make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change,\" said Obama. The impacts of climate change on health will depend on a multitude of factors, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. \"These factors include the effectiveness of a community's public health and safety systems to address or prepare for the risk and the behavior, age, gender, and economic status of individuals affected,\" the EPA says on its website. \"Impacts will likely vary by region, the sensitivity of populations, the extent and length of exposure to climate change impacts, and society's ability to adapt to change.\" The World Health Organization estimates climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050. \"Most will likely perish from malaria, diarrhea, heat exposure and under-nutrition.\" \"Around the world, variations in climate are affecting, in profoundly diverse ways, the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the water we drink,\" writes Dr. Maria Neira, director of the WHO's public health and environment department. \"We are losing our capacity to sustain human life in good health.\" \"Consider air pollution, the single greatest environmental health risk we face. In 2012 alone, exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants killed more than 7 million people -- one in eight deaths worldwide. Under-nutrition already accounts for 3 million deaths each year in the world's poorest regions. Rising temperatures and more variable rainfall patters are expected to reduce crop yields, further compromising food security. Floods are increasing in frequency and intensity, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Mosquito-borne diseases, like malaria, are particularly sensitive to heat and humidity. What will happen if rising temperatures accelerate the lifecycle of the malaria parasite?\" \"Children and the elderly will be among the most vulnerable,\" writes Neira. \"Areas with health infrastructure will be least able to cope. Developing countries will be hardest hit. The health gaps we have been trying hard to close may grow even wider.\" Earth's average temperature has risen by 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit over the past century, and is projected to rise an additional 2 degrees over the next hundred years, according to the EPA. \"Small changes in the average temperature of the planet can translate to large and potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather,\" the agency warns. \"Many places have seen changes in rainfall, resulting in more floods, droughts, or intense rain, as well as more frequent and severe heat waves.\" Still, there exists a sizable group of people who doubt climate change is happening. \"Although climate scientists have been in the news describing this winter as a strong signal that global warming is producing extreme weather, Americans are no more likely today (55%) than in the past two years to believe the effects of global warming are occurring,\" according to a March Gallup poll. A 2013 TIME magazine article makes the case that medical professionals may be the best messengers for global warming. \"Framing global warming as a public health issue rather than as an environmental or national security one produces the most emotionally compelling response among people, since it focuses on the immediate implications a warmer climate would have on people's lives,\" the article says. \"This strategy also has the benefit of providing a sense of hope that the problems can be addressed and avoided, if action is taken early enough.\" The President said what happened with Los Angeles' air proved that point. \"When the Clean Air Act was passed, not only was there a terrible smog in Los Angeles, it was true in most metropolitan areas across the country,\" Obama said. \"The fact is that air quality has dramatically improved and it's been much cheaper than anybody expected, because technology advanced and people figured out how to do it. As a consequence, the American people are a lot healthier, in addition to being able to, you know, see the mountains in the background because it's not covered in smog.\" \"We know how to do this,\" Obama said. \"We just have to be bold and recognize and trust the kind of innovative spirit that the American people have always displayed.\"\n\noutput:",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nCatania, Italy (CNN)The boat that sank in the Mediterranean over the weekend with hundreds of migrants on board may have capsized after being touched or swamped by a cargo ship that came to its aid, a U.N. official said. Carlotta Asami, a spokeswoman for the United Nations' refugee agency, made the comments to CNN early Tuesday after she and two of her colleagues had spoken to multiple survivors from the disaster who arrived in Catania, Italy. \"They say that there was a point in which they were very close and probably what happened is that, you know, a big ship creating a big wave -- they were approaching in a very strong manner and they lost balance,\" Asami said. The account she offered differs from that provided by Italian authorities on Sunday. They said that as the cargo ship King Jacob approached late Saturday, migrants on the smaller boat moved to one side, hoping to be saved, and caused the vessel to capsize. Mark Clark -- a communications executive representing OSM Maritime Group, the company that manages the King Jacob -- denied that the cargo ship caused the migrant boat to capsize. He said he also believed that people on the migrant boat rushed to one side, causing many to fall off. The cargo ship was going very slowly as it approached, hardly making any waves, Clark told CNN. It deployed rescue boats, a gangway, nets and life rings, he said. The conflicting accounts of the chaotic events highlight the challenges faced by commercial vessels that are often called upon to help in the escalating migrant boat crisis in the Mediterranean. Asami said the survivors whom she and her colleagues spoke to were \"consistent\" in what they were saying. She said their accounts made it \"credible to think\" that between 800 and 850 people were on board the boat that capsized roughly 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Libya. Previous estimates had put the number of people aboard anywhere between 700 and 950. Italian authorities, who have been coordinating the rescue effort, say only 28 survivors were rescued and 24 bodies have been recovered. The King Jacob, whose crew members are all from the Philippines, saved 22 of the survivors, according to Clark. The cause of the shipwreck is part of Italian authorities' investigation, said Giovanni Salvi, Catania's public prosecutor. Investigators want to study the King Jacob's voyage data recorder and find the wreck of the sunken boat, he told a news conference Monday. The likely toll makes the sinking the deadliest known disaster involving migrants crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa. Many of the victims are feared to be still trapped inside the sunken boat. Asami said the survivors told her and her colleagues that they were all on the highest part of the overcrowded boat, while many people were down in the lowest area. Italian authorities said Sunday that an unidentified Bangladeshi survivor had told them that the smugglers had locked many people inside the lower levels of the vessel. Two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in Sicily on Monday, according to Italian police officer Maria Guia Federico. They were the boat's Tunisian captain and a Syrian crew member, said Salvi, the Catania prosecutor. Italian police identified the two suspects through questioning survivors aboard the coast guard vessel that brought them to Catania, Salvi said, according to Italian media. The sinking appears to be the worst among an intensifying spate of migrant boat disasters in the Mediterranean to which European governments are struggling to respond. Vast numbers of people fleeing violence and poverty have been setting out on the risky journey across the Mediterranean to southern Europe for years, but authorities have reported a sharp increase this month in the numbers in need of rescue. The number of deaths has also skyrocketed. The International Organization for Migration said Monday that more than 1,100 people were estimated to have drowned in the waters between Libya and Italy just in the past week. It reported Monday that three other migrant boats could be in distress in international waters. Shipping companies recently warned that European governments are putting what they say is an unfair burden on their vessels to come to the aid of migrant boats in trouble. \"We believe it is unacceptable that the international community is increasingly relying on merchant ships and seafarers to undertake more and more large-scale rescues, with single ships having to rescue as many 500 people at a time,\" the European Community Shipowners Associations said in a letter to EU leaders last month. \"Commercial ships are not equipped to undertake such large-scale rescues, which also create serious risks to the safety, health and welfare of ships' crews who should not be expected to deal which such situations,\" the letter said. Commercial ships rescued more than 40,000 people in the Mediterranean last year, according to the International Organization for Migration. That's higher than the more than 35,000 people saved by the Italian Coast Guard but lower than the 80,000 rescued by the Italian Navy, which was running a special program, Mare Nostrum, for most of the year. European Union ministers met Monday in Luxembourg and proposed a 10-point plan to help address the crisis. \"We are not yet working on numbers, but what we have agreed on today is, for sure, the need to increase significantly the resources at sea, and the level of the operation, doing more search and rescue and doing it more together,\" said Federica Mogherini, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security police. Mogherini told CNN that the European Union must fight human traffickers, strengthen Europeans' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees. \"We need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people, so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions,\" Mogherini said. \"My pain is that it was a reaction coming too late after so many people died.\" But some groups said European officials were offering too little too late. \"What we needed from EU foreign ministers today was life-saving action, but they dithered,\" said Justin Forsyth, the chief executive of Save The Children. \"With each day we delay we lose more innocent lives and Europe slips further into an immoral abyss,\" Forsyth said in a statement. \"Right now, people desperately seeking a better life are drowning in politics.\" CNN's Karl Penhaul reported from Catania, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Hada Messia, Isa Soares and Atika Shubert contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

They also end up in another dimension, and we see the early flirtation between Sue Storm and Reed Richards as well. The movie, due out August 7, promises a very different take on the classic Marvel comics characters, played this go-round by Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Bell. We also get our first glimpse of the villainous Dr. Doom in this new trailer, released Sunday. Fans on Twitter had mixed reactions. Check out the trailer here:. The trailerpalooza of \"Star Wars,\" \"Batman v. Superman\" and \"Fantastic Four\" kept sci-fi and superhero fans chattering all weekend. Not to be outdone, the new trailer for \"Jurassic World\" came out Monday morning. It features even more of star Chris Pratt. Pratt's scientist character knows dinosaurs better than anyone. After a genetically modified mutant dinosaur escapes from an island theme park along with others, he takes charge of a mission to contain the dangerous creatures. (The trailer also includes part of a scene that caused controversy after Joss Whedon called it \"sexist\" last week.) The movie is first in the rampaging-dino franchise since \"Jurassic Park III\" in 2001. And, as we see for the first time, the dinosaurs have learned to communicate with each other. Uh-oh. Early word on Twitter was pretty good. Here's the new trailer for the movie, out June 12:.\n\noutput:",
