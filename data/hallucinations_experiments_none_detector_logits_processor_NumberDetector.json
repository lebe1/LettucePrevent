        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nIt's the kind of thing you see in movies, like Robert Redford's role in \"All Is Lost\" or Ang Lee's \"Life of Pi.\" But, in real life, it's hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days, weeks, if not months and somehow living to talk about it. Miracles do happen, though, and not just in Hollywood. We're not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the U.S. Coast Guard. Much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they'd brought aboard, if any. In order to survive, they can't bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city, town or boat -- but instead must rely on ingenuity, resourcefulness and luck. It's hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly, with a sailor dying at sea, except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues. Such happy endings do occur -- given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says, a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts. Below are a few recent examples:. Louis Jordan says that he set off on his 35-foot sailboat from South Carolina in late January. He headed into the Gulf Stream looking for a good spot to catch fish. And then everything -- his boat, his life -- turned upside down. Rescued man says he is 'utterly thankful' Not only did his boat capsize, but its mast broke, Jordan said. And so, too, did his shoulder. He bought time by rationing water, then collecting fresh water in a bucket. As to food, Jordan says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish. And he rigged a makeshift mast and sail. But, Jordan said, \"It took so long. It moved so slowly.\" His sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a German-flagged container ship, the Houston Express, spotted Jordan about 200 miles off the North Carolina coast on Thursday. After their reunion, his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads. \"I thought I lost you.\" Jose Salvador Alvarenga says his journey began in Paredon Viejo, a port on Mexico's Pacific coast, in late 2012. The exact date is up for debate -- he says he set off in December, locals say it was November. But what's not in doubt is that, after he left, he disappeared. Until January 2013. That's when Alvarenga interacted with humans once again, thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the Marshall Islands. Castaway recounts how he survived over a year adrift in Pacific. What was supposed to be a one-day trip, he says, turned into an arduous odyssey across the Pacific Ocean, one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive. His nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course. Then a storm hit causing their boat, which was about three people long and one wide, to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and GPS systems. Four weeks in, Alvarenga said his partner -- 23-year-old Ezequiel Cordova, according to the boat's owner -- died because he refused to eat raw birds. The days, weeks and months ran together after that. Alvarenga says he drank rainwater and, when there wasn't any available, his own urine. He ate sea turtles. Then, after 13 or 14 months adrift, he and his small, heavily damaged boat arrived on the Ebon Atoll, about a 22-hour boat ride from the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro. The atoll has one phone line, no Internet service and a few residents, two of whom Alvarenga spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods. The El Salvador native told CNN that his faith in God helped him survive. \"I thought, 'I am going to get out,\" he said. \"Get out, get out, get out.\" Some in their late 60s might relax in their retirement, reining it in a few notches as life slows down. And if you live in Hawaii, there's even more reason to take it easy. The thing is: Ron Ingraham isn't one of those people. He's a fisherman. The sea is both his life and livelihood, his son, Zakary, told CNN. And he's tough, with his son jokingly comparing him to Rambo. Still, even the hardiest fishermen would have been tested by what Ron Ingraham went through after setting off around last Thanksgiving solo from the Hawaiian island of Molokai. Son vindicated as father rescued after 12 days at sea. After bad weather hit, Ron Ingraham told CNN affiliate KHNL/KGMB that his 25-foot sailboat went \"backwards all night long.\" At one point, a huge wave struck -- pushing his mast into the water and him as well. The 67-year-old used a rope to pull himself back in. But his boat couldn't be rescued so easily, leaving him at the mercy of the current. A distress call went out, prompting a search that would cover 12,000 square miles. When a Coast Guard official told him the search was being called off December 1, Zakary Ingraham responded, \"I don't feel like he's dead. I don't feel it.\" He was right. Twelve days after that first distress call, Ron Ingraham was picked up about 64 miles (103 kilometers) south of Honolulu \"weak, hungry and dehydrated\" and -- most importantly -- alive. The veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him. In February 2012, two friends asked 18-year-old Adrian Vasquez whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition. He said yes, and the three set off from the Panama town of San Carlos on a small boat, Vasquez's mother, Nilsa de la Cruz, recalled. Things started out well, by all accounts. The three caught plenty of fish. Then, their boat's engine died without warning. And, with no tools and scant navigational experience, the trio didn't know what to do, according to Vasquez's mother. Mother calls Panama teen's return 'a miracle' Vazquez ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat, the Fifty Cents, further and further from the coast and into the Pacific Ocean. Somewhere along the way, his two companions died. It's not clear exactly how, with Ecuadorian Rear. Adm. Freddy Garcia Calle saying Vasquez threw their bodies into the sea \"because they had become badly decomposed.\" Some 26 days after and nearly 600 miles away from where the journey began, fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the Galapagos Islands. The Ecuadorian navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor, who'd lost 20 pounds and showed \"severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition,\" according to Calle. He returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him, but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal. \"For us, this is an opportunity to get closer as a family,\" his mother said by phone, \"to be more understanding and loving.\" Sometimes one doesn't have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled. Sometimes people don't have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end. For proof, look no further than Hiromitsu Shinkawa. 60-year-old man waves red flag to alert rescuers. He was at home on March 11, 2011, when a massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck 231 miles northeast of Tokyo. A devastating tsunami followed, its 30-foot waves ravaging cities and towns and damaging several nuclear reactors. By the time it had run the course, nearly 16,000 people were dead. It's a miracle Shinkawa wasn't one of them. Shortly after the quake, he and his wife had gone to collect some belongings when the tsunami slammed their hometown of Minamisoma. His home was one of the tens of thousands destroyed by the the huge, powerful tsunami wave. \"I was saved by holding onto the roof,\" the 60-year-old said, according to Kyodo News Agency. \"But my wife was swept away.' More than two days later, video showed Shinkawa barely visible amid heaps of splintered wood, shattered homes and other debris floating more than nine miles (15 kilometers) out to sea. He was waving a self-made red flag. After being spotted by crew aboard a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer and picked up in a smaller rescue boat, he took a drink offered to him and burst into tears, Kyodo reported. Shinkawa told his rescuers, \"I thought today was the last day of my life.\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 173 words:\nWhen Hong Kong police answered a call in the early hours of a Saturday morning last November, they encountered a grisly scene and an alleged crime that shocked the city. One woman was lying on the floor with cuts to her neck and buttocks. Another was stuffed inside a suitcase on the balcony. A former banker, 29-year-old Briton Rurik Jutting, was charged with two counts of murder. On Thursday, a court hearing that was to determine whether there was enough evidence to proceed to trial was adjourned until May. Here's what we know so far about the victims and their alleged attacker. Jutting allegedly lived at the murder scene, an upmarket apartment in the middle of Wan Chai, an inner-city suburb that's home to an eclectic mix of late-night bars, residential tower blocks and local markets selling groceries and assorted cheap goods. In the early hours of Saturday morning, November 1, police say Jutting called them to the apartment.  There they found a woman lying on the blood-splattered floor, later identified as 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih. During a search of the apartment, officers uncovered another body hidden in a suitcase on the balcony. It's alleged 25-year-old Sumarti Ningsih was killed on October 27, five days before her body was found. Sumarti Ningsih was from Cilacap, in Central Java, and was the mother of a five-year-old girl. In a statement, her cousin, Jumiati, described her as  \"just an ordinary woman from Indonesia\" who, like many others, was \"forced to work abroad to feed her poor family and make her dream comes (sic) true.\" \"She wanted to work as professional so she can earn money and dignity for her family,\" Jumiati wrote. \"She is good girl and did not deserve this treatment.\" According to the Asian Migrant Coordinating Body, Ningsih was visiting Hong Kong as a tourist and had been due to fly back to Jakarta the day after her body was found. Last year, her grieving father, Ahmad Khaliman, told Agence France-Presse that his daughter had worked in Hong Kong as a domestic helper between 2011 and 2013. She'd since returned on two occasions, Khaliman said. He said the family had been shocked by her murder, and called for the perpetrator to be executed. \"If not, I cannot accept it. He has already taken my daughter's life, so he has to pay with his life,\" he told CNN affiliate Trans7. Seneng Mujiasih had more recently worked as a domestic worker in Hong Kong but had overstayed her visa, according to the Asian Migrant Co-ordinating Body. Also known as Jesse Lorena, Mujiasih was from the city of Muna in Sulawesi province, in southeast Indonesia. Other than that, few details are known about her life and why she stayed on in Hong Kong. After news of their death spread, fellow domestic workers held a vigil in Hong Kong's Victoria Park. Around 200 people gathered to sing and pray, and lay flowers besides photos of the two women. The victims' bodies were buried after being repatriated to Indonesia in November. Before being taken into custody, Rurik Jutting lived in the upmarket J Residence in Wan Chai.  He was detained at the scene, where police found the bodies of two women and seized a knife during a search of the premises. It's unclear when Jutting left his job as a trader at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch; a BoA spokesman would only confirm that a man of the same name had worked there in the past. Jutting's profile on LinkedIn said he haad been employed at the bank's structured equity finance and trading division in Hong Kong since July 2013. Before that, he worked in the same unit in London for three years. According to the profile, Jutting previously worked in capital markets for the British bank Barclays and studied history and law at the prestigious University of Cambridge, between 2004 and 2008. As part of the trial process, tests were conducted to determined if Jutting was psychologically fit to enter a plea. He was. The case was then adjourned to allow for more than 200 pieces of forensic and DNA evidence to be analyzed.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 196 words:\nThe outlines of a nuclear deal with Iran are in place. Unfortunately, it seems like too many in President Barack Obama's administration have forgotten that the only reason this terrorist-supporting state came to the negotiating table in the first place was because of tough sanctions imposed by the U.S. Congress. Indeed, the reality is that President Obama is giving up enormous leverage in his nuclear deal with Iran -- and I worry we will lose it for good. Bleeding money, and faced with falling oil prices, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei gave his government rare permission to bargain with the \"Great Satan\" -- the United States. But just as U.S. and European sanctions were forcing Iran to the nuclear crossroads, President Obama has given Tehran an easy exit. For Khamenei, the \"framework\" announced last week looks like a win-win: He gets to keep his nuclear infrastructure, and in return gets billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Congress offered a better strategy when the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, and I introduced a bill to hit Tehran with its toughest sanctions yet. Unfortunately, this bill -- which passed the House in a 400-20 vote -- was blocked in the Senate last year, despite the fact that it would have sharpened the Ayatollah's choice: Dismantle your nuclear weapons program or see your economy collapse. President Obama once had a tougher line, when in 2012 he said: \"The deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program. It's very straightforward.\" But the framework announced last week does nothing of the sort. Negotiated between Iran and the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, the framework concedes that Iran can maintain \"a mutually defined enrichment program,\" operate thousands of centrifuges, and continue its research and development of nuclear technologies. The deal currently on the table would hand Tehran billions of previously sanctioned funds, filling the coffers of the world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism, with strongholds in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon. Meanwhile, the strictest restrictions on Iran's enrichment will expire in only 10 years, despite the President receiving a letter from 367 Members of Congress -- both Democrats and Republicans -- in which we insisted that \"verifiable constraints on Iran's nuclear program must last for decades.\" The President admitted as much when he conceded that \"in year 13, 14, 15, they have advanced centrifuges that enrich uranium fairly rapidly, and at that point the breakout times would have shrunk almost down to zero.\" But as bad as these concessions are, the most concerning aspect of the April 2 deal is that it lacks tough safeguards to stop Iran from cheating. The key question is this: Will the inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency be allowed to inspect these military sites without warning? Because if the IAEA cannot conduct \"anytime, anywhere\" inspections, Iran will be able to \"sneak out\" to a bomb. It has been done before. Remember, in 1994, when President Bill Clinton told us he had struck a deal with North Korea that would \"make the United States, the Korean Peninsula, and the world safer\"? President Clinton sounded a little too much like the current Secretary of State John Kerry, when he promised that the North Korea agreement \"does not rely on trust\" and that \"compliance will be certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\" Twelve years after these assurances, North Korea detonated its first nuclear bomb. Iran could easily do the same. The best predictor of its future behavior is its past behavior -- between 2004 and 2009, the Iranian government built a huge centrifuge facility named Fordo under a mountain deep in the Iranian desert. Luckily for the world, Western intelligence agencies discovered Tehran's deception. But we cannot rely on such luck in the future, particularly when Iran still hasn't come clean about its history of secret weapons development and is still dodging basic questions from the IAEA. Let's not forget the other things Iran has been doing while its diplomats have been bargaining with the U.S. and its partners. While Iran was showing its friendly new face to the world, it has simultaneously been helping Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad kill his own people, training and funding the terrorist group Hezbollah, which aims to annihilate Israel, and supporting the Houthis, who started a civil war and overthrew the government in Yemen -- one of America's more reliable counterterrorism partners in the region. If President Obama is going to hand over billions of dollars to a regime that behaves like this, run by a man who publicly declares: \"Death to America,\" it has to be a better deal. The framework we have before us keeps Iran's nuclear door well and truly open.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The nuclear deal with Iran, which is currently being negotiated, has raised concerns due to the concessions made by the Obama administration. Critics argue that the U.S. is giving up significant leverage, as tough sanctions imposed by Congress were the reason Iran came to the negotiating table in the first place. The Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei, gave permission for negotiations due to economic pressure from sanctions and falling oil prices. However, the framework of the deal allows Iran to keep its nuclear infrastructure and receive billions of dollars in sanctions relief. A bill passed in the House in 2015, which aimed to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, was blocked in the Senate. The deal also lacks sufficient safeguards to prevent Iran from cheating and developing nuclear weapons in the future. Iran's past behavior, such as building a secret centrifuge facility under a mountain in the 2000s, raises concerns about its future intentions. Additionally, Iran continues to support terrorism and destabilize the Middle East through its actions in Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. Critics argue that the deal does not do enough to address these issues and that the U.S. should have taken a tougher stance.",

The person responsible is the man's mother, who on Sunday faced a host of charges after allegedly abandoning her son and catching a bus to Maryland to see her boyfriend, said Philadelphia police Lt. John Walker. Low temperatures reached the mid-30s during the week, and rain was reported in the area Wednesday and Thursday. The man is unable to communicate how he came to be in the park, but Walker told reporters that the man's mother, whom he did not identify for CNN, left him there Monday morning. \"Sometime at 11 a.m., the mother went to visit her boyfriend down in Maryland, over in Montgomery County, and we believe she placed the child into Cobbs Creeks Park,\" Walker said at a news conference. Walker told CNN the man was transported to Presbyterian Hospital, but CNN affiliates reported he was being treated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He suffered eye problems, dehydration, malnutrition and a cut to the back that has raised infection concerns, the lieutenant told reporters. \"This kid's obviously a fighter,\" Walker said during a Saturday news conference. \"It's just unbelievable how we found him out there last night. To see that kid laying there, it's heartbreaking to see another human, especially a mother, can treat someone like that.\" Officials at Philadelphia's School of the Future, which the man attends, became concerned when he didn't show up for classes and tried to contact his mother but eventually reached an aunt, CNN affiliate WPVI reported. When police tracked down the mother, she told them her son was with her, Walker said. \"She indicated to both family members and the police officers that the child was with her down with her boyfriend in Maryland,\" he said.

The victim -- Ron Lane, whom officials said was a longtime employee and the school's print shop operator -- was white, as is the suspect. Lane's relatives said he was gay, CNN affiliate WNCN reported. The suspect, Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, worked with Lane as part of a work-study program, but was let go from the program in early March due to poor attendance, college President Kay Albertson said Tuesday. On Monday, Stancil walked into the print shop on the third floor of a campus building, aimed a pistol-grip shotgun and fired once, killing Lane, according to Sutton. Stancil has tattoos on his face. Sutton said investigators are looking into whether he is part of a white supremacist gang. He has no previous criminal record, authorities said. Sutton said Stancil fled on a motorcycle after the shooting and ultimately abandoned it in a highway median. Then, Stancil continued on to Daytona, Florida, but authorities don't know how he traveled, Sutton said. He was arrested just after 1 a.m. Tuesday, after he was found sleeping on a beach, about 550 miles (885 kilometers) from Goldsboro. Volusia County Beach Patrol had approached him for violating the city's ordinance against sleeping on the beach. He had a knife, police said. He was taken into custody without incident.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nIt's not easy being the Pope. Not only does he shepherd nearly 1 billion Catholic souls, he also leads a small but morally significant state with envoys and interests in nearly every country. As scholars like to say, the Vatican has walked the line between spiritual and worldly concerns for centuries. Sometimes, as when St. John Paul II stood up to Communist Poland, the church's moral and political clout have combined to pack a powerful punch. At other times, popes have to make a hard choice: Adopt the sharp tongue of a prophet or the discretion of a diplomat? This Sunday in Rome, Pope Francis faced just such a dilemma. First, the back story:. One hundred years ago, more than 1 million Armenians (some estimates run as high as 1.5 million) died at the hand of the Turks. Many of the victims were part of a branch of Christianity closely aligned with Catholicism. A slew of  historians and at least 20 countries call the killings a \"genocide.\" (A U.S. resolution to do the same has languished in Congress.) Turkish officials disagree, arguing that the deaths, while unfortunate, were part of a long-running war that witnessed casualties on all sides. For their part, previous popes had finessed the genocide question. John Paul II used the \"g\" word in 2001, but didn't dare speak it out loud. Instead, it was tucked into a document signed by the former pontiff and the head of the Armenian church, after they had celebrated Mass together. Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI called the killings \"a great evil\" and \"terrible persecution\" in a speech 2006, but avoided labeling them genocide. (Benedict found other ways to tick off the Turks, initially opposing their entry into the European Union.) As Pope Francis prepared to celebrate a special Mass Sunday to commemorate a century since the slaughter,  Vatican watchers were divided about whether he would use the word \"genocide.\" He did, but in a roundabout way, by quoting John Paul's document. \"In the past century, our human family has lived through three massive and unprecedented tragedies,\" Francis said. \"The first, which is widely considered 'the first genocide of the 20th century,' struck your own Armenian people.\" The middle phrase comes directly from the document issued 14 years ago by John Paul. In citing his predecessor, Francis highlighted one of the Vatican's chiefest concerns, especially on matters of moral import: continuity. Whether holding the line against artificial birth control, declining to ordain female priests or dealing with diplomatic tensions, it sometimes seems as if the church considers inconsistency the most unforgivable of sins. \"The Vatican and the papacy love continuity,\" said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a Vatican analyst for National Catholic Reporter. If Francis had not called the Armenian killings a genocide, particularly at such a high-profile event -- the audience included Armenia's President -- it might have been interpreted as a change in church policy, Reese said. At the same time, Francis didn't want to anger the Turks more than necessary, especially since they have become a key ally against the persecution of Christians by ISIS in the Middle East, which the Pope alluded to in his speech on Sunday. \"The fact that he quoted John Paul is a sign that he's downplaying it,\" Reese said of the Armenian murders. \"He's telling people: There's nothing new here.\" New or not, Turkey was not happy. The nation recalled its Vatican ambassador for \"consultations\" just hours after Francis' comments, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. Turkey also promptly summoned his counterpart, the Vatican's ambassador, for a meeting, Turkish state broadcaster TRT reported. In a tweet Sunday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called the Pope's use of the word \"unacceptable\" and \"out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis.\" \"Religious authorities are not places through which hatred and animosity are fueled by unfounded allegations,\" the tweet reads. \"Hatred\" and \"animosity\" are not words often used to describe Pope Francis. Because he often shines a sympathetic face on the world, emphasizing mercy over judgment, it's easy to miss the bluntness Francis brings to the bully pulpit. On matters of doctrine and diplomacy, he may be carrying on Catholic traditions, but in his willingness to engage in geopolitics and the tone that engagement often takes, this pope is decidedly different. He has helped broker a backroom detente between the United States and Cuba, and invited Israeli and Palestinian leaders for an unprecedented prayer service at the Vatican (after annoying some Israelis with an impromptu prayer at the wall that separates the West Bank from Jerusalem.) But Francis has also suggested that force may be justified to stop ISIS' slaughter of Christians, warned of the \"Mexicanization\" of Argentina and said that satirists who insult religion should expect a retaliatory punch. On Monday, the Pope addressed a roomful of priests at morning Mass. He must have heard the hubbub about his \"genocide\" remark, but he encouraged his charges to speak frankly, without fear, and to bear the courage of their convictions, just as the early apostles had. \"We cannot keep silent about what we have seen and heard,\" Francis said. CNN's Gul Tuysuz  and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The Pope, as the spiritual leader of nearly 1 billion Catholics and the head of the small but influential Vatican state, often faces the challenge of balancing spiritual and worldly concerns. This past Sunday, Pope Francis had to decide whether to use a strong moral stance or diplomatic discretion regarding the Armenian genocide centenary. Previous popes had avoided labeling the 1915 killings of up to 1.5 million Armenians as genocide, but Francis quoted John Paul II's description of it as the \"first genocide of the 20th century\" during a Mass commemorating the event. Turkey, which disputes the genocide label, recalled its ambassador for consultations and summoned the Vatican's ambassador for a meeting in response. The Pope's use of the term was described as \"unacceptable\" and \"out of touch with historical facts and legal basis\" by Turkey's Foreign Minister. Despite potential diplomatic repercussions, Francis emphasized the importance of continuity in the Vatican's stance on moral issues.",

Somalia-based Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack. Group spokesman Sheikh Abdiaziz Musab, speaking to pro-Al-Shabaab outlet Andalus radio, said the blast targeted and killed several Somali intelligence agents. Somali police spokesman Qasim Mohamed Roble told reporters that the car bomb killed no government official or soldier. Among the dead, he said, was a boy who shined shoes. The area is not a new target for Al-Shabaab, which has battled Somalia's government for years with the goal of establishing a fundamentalist Islamic state. The restaurant is across the street from the Central Hotel, where Al-Shabaab killed at least 15 people in a bombing and gun attack in February. The streets outside the restaurant were \"littered with debris and human body parts\" after Tuesday's explosion, witness Mohamed Ali said. The blast damaged nearby buildings and vehicles at a parking lot, according to Ali. Ambulances took wounded people to a nearby hospital for treatment. Tuesday's bombing is at least the third high-profile attack near or at a Mogadishu hotel since February. On February 20, militants attacked the Central Hotel, blowing up a car bomb outside before shooting people and detonating another bomb inside. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack. More than a month later, on March 27, gunmen detonated explosives and shot people at a different Mogadishu hotel -- the Makka Al Mukarama -- leaving at least 20 people dead. The attack stretched into the next day before security personnel killed all the assailants. Al-Shabaab also said it was responsible for the Makka Al Mukarama attack, claiming it targeted the hotel because its guests were spies and government officials. Among those killed in the March 27 assault was Yusuf Mohamed Ismail Bari-Bari, Somalia's permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, the Somali government said. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "A car bomb explosion in Mogadishu, Somalia, near the presidential palace killed at least 10 people, including a woman and a boy, according to police. Al-Shabaab, a Somalia-based Islamist militant group, claimed responsibility for the attack, which targeted and killed several Somali intelligence agents, according to the group's spokesman. The blast killed no government official or soldier, but did kill a shoe-shining boy. The area, which is not new to Al-Shabaab attacks, is across the street from the Central Hotel, where Al-Shabaab killed at least 15 people in a bombing and gun attack in February. The streets were littered with debris and human body parts after the explosion, which damaged nearby buildings and vehicles. Tuesday's bombing is the third high-profile attack near or at a Mogadishu hotel since February. Previous attacks included the Central Hotel in February and the Makka Al Mukarama Hotel in March, which left at least 45 people dead.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nOn October 31, 2014, the Italian government announced the end of \"Mare Nostrum\" -- a naval mission that rescued would-be migrants in peril as they tried to cross the Mediterranean to seek security and a new life in Europe. In the operation's year-long existence, the Italian Navy and Coastguard had rescued an estimated 100,000 people. But it proved expensive and politically contentious, and Europe was not prepared to help Italy shoulder the burden of the crisis. Without European support, the Italian government cut back the naval assets dedicated to rescuing migrants. Mare Nostrum, which had been launched after some 600 people died when two migrant ships sank in 2013, was replaced by the more modest \"Operation Triton,\" under the auspices of the European Union's border agency, Frontex. Triton has about one-third of the funding of Mare Nostrum, with just six ships and patrol boats, two planes and one helicopter. It was designed as a policing rather than a humanitarian mission. At its inception, Klaus Rosler, operations director for Frontex, said \"Triton is not a replacement for Mare Nostrum.\" Nor was Frontex \"a coordinating body for search and rescue operations.\" Six months later, the argument about how to handle unprecedented numbers of desperate people heading for Europe continues unabated. Contributors to Triton include Portugal, the Netherlands, Finland and Iceland. Britain -- for example -- is not. It argues that search and rescue operations in international waters are \"an unintended 'pull factor,' encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths.\" It's perhaps no coincidence that immigration is a hot-button issue in Britain, with the UK Independence Party attacking the Conservative-led coalition government for being soft on allowing foreigners into the country. Similarly, the opposition Northern League in Italy opposed Mare Nostrum, accusing it of enticing migrants. If the first few months of this year are any guide, demand has not diminished even if the prospect of being rescued has. People from Syria, Mali and Eritrea are among the tens of thousands trying to escape repression, violence and abject poverty. Despite the danger, the great majority head first for Libya, where the collapse of authority allows smuggling operations to go unhindered. Italy -- the European state whose territory is closest to Libya -- has borne the brunt of the task of picking up, sheltering and providing food and medical help to the illegal migrants. In 2014, 170,000 migrants arrived in Italy by sea. Italian ships have picked up about 11,000 migrants in the past week alone. The islands of Sicily and of Lampedusa (which is closer to Tunisia than to mainland Italy) see an almost daily influx of human misery. And at this time of year, there is a surge in the illegal trafficking as the weather and sea conditions improve. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has said the Mediterranean is a sea, not a cemetery. On Sunday, in the wake of the latest disaster, he complained that Italy had been coping with the crisis in \"near solitude, sometimes assisted by some other international presence.\" Italy has also led calls for an international peacekeeping issue to help restore stability in Libya, not least in an effort to tackle the flow of migrants, many of whom set out from around Misrata and other ports in the west of the country. According to some human rights groups, the danger to migrants on the high seas has been accentuated by merchant ships turning a blind eye to boats in distress -- despite a maritime obligation to come to the aid of vessels in peril. After the latest sinking, the European Commission called an urgent meeting of foreign and interior ministers, saying that \"the reality is stark and our actions must therefore be bold. These are human lives at stake, and the European Union as a whole has a moral and humanitarian obligation to act.\" EU Foreign Policy chief Federica Mogherini, who is Italian, said Sunday: \"We need to save human lives all together, as all together we need to protect our borders and to fight the trafficking of human beings.\"  The task could not be \"left only to the southern countries,\" she insisted. But bold action is rarely a hallmark of the EU. The recently installed head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Junker, has set out his priorities -- but they are yet to be acted upon. Junker said the current budget of Frontex - some 90 million euros ($97 million) - was \"a good start but does not yet equal the task of protecting Europe's common borders.\" That money has to cover all Frontex's roles -- and it's not only the Italian coast that is being targeted by migrants. Further east, thousands of migrants are trying to reach Greece by land and sea. According to the UN's refugee agency, 219,000 refugees and migrants crossed the Mediterranean last year. Junker has also argued for greater assistance to the European Asylum Support Office, which is based in Malta, arguing for \"more thorough risk assessments to spot problem areas before they become overloaded.\" Most controversially, Junker is proposing Europe adopt a common asylum system, saying that \"one and the same applicant for asylum can have a 70-75% chance of being granted asylum in one country of the European Union and less than 1%, with the same reasons, in another country.\" But progress toward a Europe-wide approach on migration is painfully slow. The European Commission plans to publish a policy document next month, but member states are in no hurry to grapple with such a politically explosive and costly subject. In the meantime, the argument in European meetings is likely to focus on priorities, with some (the UK and Germany) likely to argue that more resources must be devoted to cracking down on the lucrative people-smuggling racket. \"We must target the traffickers who are responsible for so many people dying at sea and prevent their innocent victims from being tricked or forced into making these perilous journeys,\" said British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond Sunday. Others, including Italy, Greece, Spain and France, are expected to seek more concerted action in handling and funding the influx. But the hundreds of migrants being herded onto barely seaworthy boats from Libyan beaches will be oblivious to the debate.

About 4,500 people have been isolated by flood waters as \"the roads are cut off and we won't be able to reach them for a few days,\" Michael Langley, spokesman for the New South Wales State Emergency Service said. Devastating winds lashed cars and homes. The storm system also brought destructive flooding that washed away houses and brought down trees onto streets and buildings. The emergency services have been slammed with 13,000 calls for help due to flooding and have carried out 144 rescue tasks. The powerful storm has already claimed four lives, according to New South Wales Police. The dangerous conditions have prompted the police department to issue pleas on social media for people to not attempt driving through flooded areas. The heavy flooding prompted school and college closures and disruptions to public transportation. The adverse weather was caused by an intense low pressure system, said Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. The strongest wind gusts peaked at 135 km/h (85 mph) and it was estimated that about 200 millimeters (7.87 inches) of rainfall fell in the area on Tuesday. Transport NSW, which provides public transportation throughout the New South Wales area, issued a warning that many public services across the region have been disrupted because of the weather. It also posted a video on its Facebook page showing CCTV footage of a flood waters rising in a train station. Samantha Mancuso was driving in her neighborhood of Liverpool, a suburb in Sydney on Wednesday, when she noticed gallons of water pouring into the streets. She said Joe Broad Reserve, a nearby park, was flooded. The severe weather caused a local creek to break its banks and now the flooding is seeping into the neighborhood.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 178 words:\nSeoul, South Korea (CNN)On March 20, 2013, a cyberattack brought chaos to several banks and media outlets in South Korea. Then more ominously on December 23 last year, computers at the country's nuclear operator were breached.  Again cybercrime was suspected. The source of these attacks? North Korea. And South Korean investigators say they have proof -- the actual malicious codes used in the attacks. They shared this data with CNN. The 2013 attack, known as \"Dark Seoul,\" paralyzed an estimated 48,000 computers at a number of major banks and broadcasters, disrupting network systems and wiping their hard disks clean. \"It would try to delete essentially all your files... then restart the system. You would come back up and nothing would be there,\" Joshua James, a digital forensic expert, told CNN. \"If it infected more financial systems, it could have deleted all financial data in Korea. I mean, it is dangerous,\" the visiting professor at Chuncheon's Hallym University added. Live footage of the breaches showed computer screens at the media companies completely down, while bank customers were unable to make withdrawals, or transfer money online. \"Dark Seoul\" happened shortly after the North Korean government announced it would end the armistice agreement that brought the three-year Korean War to an end in July 1953 amid growing tensions with its neighbor. The latest high-profile digital incursion, in December, attempted to steal data from South Korea's nuclear operator, including plant blueprints and personnel information. Though investigators said no critical data was stolen, the attack raised serious concerns about the safety and security of the 23 nuclear power plants it runs. The attack itself was described by James as a \"spear-fishing\" exercise where unsuspecting victims -- retired and current employees of the nuclear operator -- were prompted to open up a disguised document in their email. \"As soon as you double click on it, it starts running in the background of your computer where you can't see ... it's also trying to open up your computer -- what we call a back door -- to give access to the infected system by the attacker,\" he told CNN. The attack, which James said was simpler than \"Dark Seoul,\" came just a few days after Sony Pictures said their systems has been \"hacked,\" another attack the South Korean authorities blamed on North Korea. \"From a law enforcement or investigation side, we're trying to actually trace back to who did it,\" said James. Seoul announced in mid-March that some of the IP addresses used in December incursion could be traced back to Shenyang, China, which can be easily accessed from the North Korean border. Codes used in the attack were said to be similar in pattern to those used by the North Koreans, South Korean authorities said. \"The malicious codes used in the attack were same in composition and working methods as \"Kimsuky\" codes known to be used by North Korea,\" the prosecutor's office that leads 17 other government agencies and Internet companies in the investigation said in the statement in March. Pyongyang has dismissed the claims it launched these attacks, calling them a \"plot and fabrication that can never win over the truth.\" But many experts say North Korea appears to be investing more in cyberwarfare because it is cheaper than spending on conventional weapons and can cause significant economic damage to its southern rival. Indeed South Korea's Defense Ministry estimates that North Korea is operating a \"cyberarmy\" of 6,000 workers as it focuses on strengthening its asymmetrical warfare capability. \"Hacks are going on all the time, constantly -- though how many actually make the news is a very small amount,\" said James. \"How many are detected in general? I think the average person would have no clue they've been hacked. \"Organizations need to invest the same amount that hackers are investing to protect themselves and right now they're not,\" he added. Many in South Korea believe not enough effort is being put into defending against cyberattacks. A report by the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade, a government-funded think tank, estimates that \"Dark Seoul\" caused about $820 million worth of damage. Its report, published in 2014, predicted that by 2020, South Korea could be exposed to hacking attacks causing up to $25 billion in economic damage.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nBoston (CNN)Adrianne Haslet-Davis and her husband, Adam Davis, were standing near the finish line on the day of the Boston Marathon bombing. Her feet were sore from wearing 4.5-inch heels. Still, they walked to Boylston Street to watch the runners. \"We were so in love and happy together,\" she told a federal jury Wednesday. It was the second day the Boston jury heard a procession of heartbreaking loss -- the survivors and families of those killed when twin bombs planted by the pair of brothers named Tsarnaev exploded near the finish line. The jury must decide whether bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. Haslet-Davis and Davis, who had just returned from a tour in Afghanistan with the Air Force, were steps away from the explosion near the Forum restaurant. She recalled the force of the blast that killed three people and injured over 200 that April day in 2013. She knew right away it was a terrorist attack. Screams and heavy smoke filled the air. She couldn't hear her own screams. She thought she was dead. When her husband, who also was injured, lifted her leg, he too let out a scream. She said she thought he was in shock. She rolled over onto her stomach and crawled over broken glass, shredding her arms. She dragged herself to the Forum. \"I saw all five of my toes, but I saw a lot of blood,\" she said. \"I didn't see my ankle.\" A ballroom dancer, Haslet-Davis' left leg would later be amputated below the knee. Inside the Forum, Haslet-Davis begged for whiskey. \"I just wanted the pain to go away. I only begged for the whiskey when I thought I was going to die.\" When someone removed Adam's shoe, an artery was spurting blood. His face got whiter and whiter, she said. His eye rolled back. She thought he was dead. At a hospital, she called her parents on her cellphone. She told them she was in a terrorist attack. \"I don't think I have a left foot anymore,\" she told her father. \"I'm in really bad shape and I really need to talk to you because this might be it.\" Her father told her he was driving and it was illegal to pull over. \"I don't care if it's illegal. I need to talk to you because these might be our last words. I said I was in a terrorist attack at the Boston Marathon and Adam is dead and this might be it for me.\" Haslet-Davis told the jury that, at the Forum, her husband kept telling her he was sorry. \"That was all he could say. That he loved me. He was so sorry.\" Her husband, she said, has since \"bravely admitted himself into a mental facility at the VA hospital.\" After her testimony, Haslet-Davis walked slowly off the stand. She appeared to glare at Tsarnaev, who did not look at her. Earlier this week, prosecutors showed jurors an image of Tsarnaev taken when he was in a holding cell. It was dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a gesture that Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said showed a young man who was \"unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged.\" On Wednesday, Tsarnaev's lawyer, Miriam Conrad, sought to discredit the use of the image. She suggested the gesture had been presented to the jury out of context. On cross-examination of a deputy U.S. marshal, Conrad showed the jury security footage from which the image was taken. In it, Tsarnaev is seen looking into the camera touching his hair. Moments before, he has two fingers up, forming what Conrad called a \"V sign,\" before raising his middle finger. Gary Olivera, a deputy U.S. Marshal for 14 years, admitted that the camera was encased in a reflective surface and Tsarnaev could have been using it as a mirror. \"A lot of times people do that to get our attention,\" Olivera said. Also Wednesday, Jinyan Zhao told the jury about her niece, Lingzi Lu, a \"beautiful nerd\" and graduate student at Boston University who was killed in the bombing. Lingzi Lu was originally from China but was buried in Boston. \"How she died, and why she died, it just felt like she is part of Boston, part of city,\" her aunt said. \"The thinking is she should just be here.\" The family, Zhao said, put a music box and some books in her casket. Her mother put a bracelet on her wrist and touched her hand. Later, her mother described her beautiful hand. Zhao recalled what Lu's mother said to her: \" 'No matter what I don't want to believe it is her hand.' \" The brother and stepfather of Sean Collier also took the stand Wednesday. Collier was the MIT police officer who was shot in his patrol car, another victim of the Tsarnaev brothers as they tried to evade capture. Sean Collier always wanted to be a cop, said his brother. He was a child who viewed life in terms of right and wrong. Either you did it or you didn't. \"We thought it was typical little boy stuff, but he never grew out of it,\" Andrew Collier told the jury. \"Sean was always the one to spill the beans,\" said Joe Rodgers, 59, who married Collier's mother, Kelly, in 1993. \"He was a cop from an early age.\" On a Thursday night in April 2013, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Officer Sean Collier lay bleeding in his patrol car after being ambushed and shot in the head. His car door was open, and his foot was lodged between the gas and brake pedals. The officer who found Collier testified at trial that he had wounds to the temple, neck and head. He was bleeding out as officers tried to revive him. Collier would become the fourth victim of the Tsarnaev brothers. The night still feels like a dream for Rodgers. \"He had a hole in the middle of his head,\" Rodgers said. \"He was shot to pieces. He was just laying there. My wife was touching him, and his blood was coming up in her hands.\" Prosecution shows what it calls Tsarnaev's defiant message to U.S. Prosecutors said the brothers killed Collier because they wanted his gun. But their efforts to take it were thwarted by a safety holster. Tamerlan, 26, was killed in a chase and gunbattle with police that began with reports of an \"officer down\" at MIT. Less than two weeks after Tsarneav was found guilty on every count, the jury deciding his punishment is hearing about the lasting impact of his deeds. Earlier, MIT Police Chief John DiFava told the jury that he hired Collier, who fit in \"perfectly\" because of his policing style and engaging personality. The MIT police, who are designated as special officers by the Massachusetts State Police, patrol the sprawling campus in Cambridge. \"The atmosphere of the department changed since April 18, 2013,\" he said. \"There is sadness and a sense of loss. I think that it will be there for as long as that generation of officers remains. It was remarkable the amount of support we got from the community, but Sean's death hangs like a weight.\" DiFava has come to question whether he wants to continue on the force. \"Policing is the only thing I've done in my life, and I've always tried to be good at what I do,\" he said. \"I lost one of my own. I have children at home and I've always thought I would have been very, very proud for them to wear the uniform. Now I'm not so sure.\" Rodgers said it took his wife, Kelly, months to gain the strength to climb out of bed after losing her son. Saturday was the second anniversary of the bombing. She cried all weekend. \"She was very strong,\" he said. \"She was a happy person. She was a good mother. Since Sean's death, she's very scared of anything that might happen to any of the other children.\" Kelly became pregnant with Sean after losing a baby that lived for a day or two, Rodgers said. His birth lifted her out of depression. \"He was special,\" he said, adding that Sean is now buried alongside the baby. Rodgers said he still feels beat down two years later. \"There's something missing,\" he said. \"Thanksgiving and Christmas will never be the same.\" Collier's brother Andrew said, \"Even when we're having fun, there's always a cloud over us. I miss Sean. I miss everything about him.\" The prosecution is expected to rest Friday, according to an official with insight into the prosecutor's plans.

        "answer": "Adrianne Haslet-Davis and her husband, Adam Davis, were near the Boston Marathon finish line on April 15, 2013, when twin bombs exploded, killing three people and injuring over 200. The couple, who had just returned from a tour in Afghanistan, were steps away from the Forum restaurant when the blast occurred. Haslet-Davis, a ballroom dancer, lost her left leg below the knee as a result of her injuries. She recalled the force of the blast, the screams, and the heavy smoke that filled the air. Her husband, who was also injured, kept telling her he was sorry and that he loved her. After the attack, Haslet-Davis begged for whiskey to alleviate the pain and thought both she and her husband were going to die. At the hospital, she called her parents and told them she was in a terrorist attack and that her husband was dead. Her father, who was driving, was unable to pull over. Haslet-Davis' husband has since been admitted to a mental facility at the VA hospital. The jury in the trial of bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is currently deciding whether he should face the death penalty for his role in the bombing. Tsarnaev's defense team has sought to discredit the use of an image taken of him in a holding cell on the day of his arraignment,",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 168 words:\nGiovanni Lo Porto put himself in harm's way to help, heading to Pakistan to work on a much needed reconstruction project following deadly flooding there. His work and his life, as he knew it then, came to a halt on January 19, 2012. That's when, according to Italy's state-run ANSA news agency, four armed men burst into the building where Lo Porto lived and abducted him along with colleague Bernd Muehlenbeck. Two years later, Lo Porto was dead -- killed accidentally by a U.S. drone strike, according to American authorities. The native of the Sicilian city of Palermo died along with a fellow al Qaeda hostage, American Warren Weinstein. That same counterterrorism operation in a border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan killed at least one al Qaeda leader, Ahmed Farouq, who was also a U.S. citizen. His family members, including his four brothers, called him Giancarlo. Lo Porto grew up in Sicily and then studied at London Metropolitan University, getting his undergraduate degree there in Peace and Conflict Studies in 2010, according to the school. A professor there remembers him as \"passionate, friendly (and) open-minded,\" according to an ANSA report. And the university, in a statement, described him as \"a popular student who was committed to helping others.\" \"We are tremendously proud of him and the humanitarian work he did,\" the school said. At the time he was taken captive, Lo Porto worked with the German aid organization Welthungerlife, a 53-year-old group dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty worldwide. Such work means going to places where the need is most -- places like Multan in Pakistan. That community was one of many in Pakistan devastated by major flooding in 2010, which covered about one-fifth of the country and left more than 1,500 people dead. These conditions are all too common in the South Asian nation, as evidenced by flooding one year later that forced upwards of 660,000 into refugee camps and killed more than 430 people, about a quarter of whom were children. \"He told me, 'I'm pleased to have returned to Asia and Pakistan, I love the people, culture and food in this part of the world,' \" said the London Metropolitan University professor. Specifically, Lo Porto was a project manager with Welthungerlife's clean water and sanitation program, working with 8 to 10 fellow international staffers and 100 to 200 locals starting in October 2011, according to Simone Pott, a spokeswoman for the aid group. Pott described Lo Porto as a lively, very positive man who made friends all over the world. Some of those friends in Italy, England and beyond pressed for Lo Porto's release after he was taken captive, urging Italy's government and newspaper editors to get his story out, ANSA reported. The same story said that al Qaeda (after first claiming he was being held) denied abducting Lo Porto, as did the Pakistani Taliban. Muehlenbeck, a German national, was freed last October, at which time he said that he and his colleague had been separated, according to ANSA. But Lo Porto never got the chance to savor freedom again, like his German counterpart. Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said his country's government \"carried out every effort possible to trace and try to return Giovanni to his loved ones.\" \"Unfortunately, the conclusion is now different (than we wanted) because of the tragic and fatal mistake of our American allies, which has been recognized by President Obama,\" Gentiloni said. \"The responsibility of his death and (that) of Warren Weinstein ... is that of the terrorists.\" On Thursday, after the U.S. government reported Lo Porto's death, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi expressed his \"deepest sorrow for the death of an Italian who dedicated his life to the service of others.\" Lo Porto's death left those at his former charity Welthungerlife speechless and confused, Pott said. And then there are his family members like his mother, who ANSA reports became \"another person\" after her son's kidnapping. \"Her only hope was to embrace Giovanni,\" a neighbor said. CNN's Hadia Messia contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 185 words:\nOn May 28, 2014, some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. But they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event. Instead, the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits. Armed soldiers guarded the exits. In the patently unfair, open air trial that followed, 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed. Three were sentenced to death. The public mass sentencing was part a China's \"Strike Hard\" campaign against unrest in Xinjiang, a campaign the government claims was launched to combat \"terrorism\" and \"separatism.\" But it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Today, Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide.  Much of it makes for grim reading. In Pakistan, the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows.  Iran and Iraq executed people for \"terrorism,\" and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes. In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before, governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism. Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates. Jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in December, putting 11 murder convicts to death, with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime.  In Indonesia, authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety \"national emergency.\" Six people have already been executed this year. A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool.  The rise was largely because of developments in Egypt and Nigeria, where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict. The simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both. There is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence, as United Nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed. It is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough. At Amnesty International, we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades. Thankfully, most of the world now appears to agree with us. The numbers speak for themselves. In 1945 when the United Nations was founded, only eight countries had abolished the death penalty. Today, 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice. Last year, we recorded executions in 22 countries, down by almost a half from 20 years ago. Despite the troubling developments we recorded last year, there was still much good news to be found. The number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year, from 778 to 607. This number does not include China, where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together, but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret, the true figure is impossible to determine. Executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Equatorial Guinea, Somalia and Sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter. The Americas continued to be execution-free, apart from the United States. Those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history. They must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment. Fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task, but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment. With determination, I know that we can achieve this goal.\n\noutput:",

He encapsulated the frustration and grief caused by a New York grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of a black man with a simple tweet: \"This one was on film.\" Now, he's stirring things up again with a series of tweets documenting three traffic stops in seven weeks. \"Stopped by the cops again wish me luck,\" he posted early Tuesday, along with a photo showing him behind the wheel of a car with what looks like blue police lights in the background. He posted similar photos in February. Many African-Americans have long bemoaned the phenomenon of being pulled over for no apparent reason, calling it \"driving while black.\" Blacks are about 30% more likely to be pulled over by police than whites, according to figures reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2013. And in amid increased conversation over race and policing after the high-profile deaths last year of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the issue is even more sensitive. Rock hasn't commented on the tweets and didn't say how the police stop turned out. He got lots of support on Twitter. \"My heart legit dropped, no kidding,\" one Twitter fan posted. Many praised him for documenting the stops. Some accused him of race-baiting. But one bit of advice in particular lit up social media. Actor Isaiah Washington urged Rock to \"#Adapt\" to avoid racial profiling. \"I sold my $90,000.00 Mercedes G500 and bought 3 Prius's, because I got tired of being pulled over by Police,\" Washington tweeted. Some saw that as a sell-out, saying Rock shouldn't have to take steps others might not have to as a way to avoid being pulled over. \"Let me guess..you also make sure your pants are pulled up as well?.\" Twitter user YeshaCallahan posted. Appearing on CNN, Washington defended the tweet, saying he wanted to \"excite a conversation.\" Years ago, Rock filmed a sketch for his \"Chris Rock\" show on HBO in which he detailed ways to avoid being beaten by police as a black man. Besides obeying the law, he suggested bringing a white friend along for the ride. He did just that last year in a segment of \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\" with Jerry Seinfeld.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nDurham, North Carolina (CNN)President Obama's nomination of Loretta Lynch to become the country's first African-American woman attorney general is a historic pick.  Her confirmation, however, is now taking on new historical relevance as her wait for a confirmation vote by the full Senate drags into its sixth month. The period between the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote to confirm and the full Senate vote -- which in Lynch's case has not been scheduled -- has lasted longer for her than for any attorney general nominee in recent history. By the time the Senate returns from Easter recess on Monday, it'll have been longer than the eight previous nominees for the job -- combined. Lynch, currently the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, cleared the committee February 26 by a vote of 12-8, with Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona joining Democrats in sending the nomination to the full Senate. Obama nominated Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder on November 8, after Holder had announced plans to leave the post weeks earlier. Hundreds of miles from Washington, longtime residents of Durham, North Carolina, were beaming with pride.  Lynch's family moved to the city when she was a child.  Her parents, married for 60 years, still live there.  They watched the announcement on television. \"That was encouraging but I knew then that we had a fight on our hands,\" said Lynch's father, the Rev. Lorenzo Lynch.  \"I've been in politics most of my life. I know that nothing is certain, and I know that nothing is easy.\" Lorenzo Lynch, 82, is a retired Baptist preacher and was active in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.  He ran, unsuccessfully, for mayor of Durham in 1973. For the next round of his daughter's \"fight,\" he traveled to Washington in late January to attend his daughter's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee. \"I heard a lot at that hearing that I've heard since childhood.  That is the presupposition of the mindset,\" Lorenzo Lynch said.  \"The dual system or the dual treatment.\" When asked to provide specific examples, Lorenzo Lynch deferred to the state branch of the NAACP and E. Lavonia Allison, a Durham activist who has known Loretta Lynch since the family moved to Durham. \"I don't want to think about the epidermis, but some people are thinking that way,\" Allison said, suggesting that Lynch's confirmation vote has been delayed because Lynch is African-American. \"When it has taken so long, when it has been so different from any other person who has been nominated ... how else can we interpret that it is so different?\" Allison said. In March, Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-North Carolina, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said, \"I think race certainly can be considered as a major factor in the reason for this delay, but it's also the irrationality of the new Republicans.\" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, evoked imagery of the segregated South in criticism of Republicans, saying Lynch had been \"asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar.\" Durbin was harshly criticized by Arizona's Sen. John McCain. \"I deeply regret that the senator from Illinois chose to come here yesterday and question the integrity and motivation, mine and my Republican colleagues,\" McCain said on the Senate floor.  \"It was offensive and unnecessary, and I think he owes this body, Ms. Lynch and all Americans an apology,\" McCain added. \"I thought he should be commended,\" Lorenzo Lynch said.  \"I think that's a poetic description of what has happened and poetry, like most language, is limited but it does have wings ... to carry a point.\" Giuliani pushes for Lynch confirmation. Senate Republicans adamantly deny the delay in scheduling a vote on Lynch's nomination is because she is African-American. Many point out that Lynch, if confirmed, will be replacing the country's first African-American attorney general who was confirmed by an overwhelming margin. Instead, Republicans and Democrats say the delay is part of an ongoing partisan battle.  For some, it's part of a fight over a human trafficking bill that has stalled in the Senate.  For others, the delay is retaliation for President Obama's 2014 executive actions on immigration. On the eve of Holder's announcement of his plans to leave the Department of Justice, the political number crunchers at FiveThirtyEight.com predicted that whoever the President nominated would \"likely face at least a moderately tough confirmation hearing in the Senate.\" Some of Lynch's supporters across North Carolina have organized to convince the state's two Republican senators to support Lynch's confirmation.  In March, several dozen North Carolina women, led by the NAACP, traveled to Washington to meet with their senators, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis. Reportedly, the meeting lasted nearly an hour and was very cordial. At a news conference at the Washington Press Club, the group blasted the senators for opposing the nomination. \"Senator Burr and Senator Tillis, it is time for you to act like you have some sense.  It's past time.  You have embarrassed the state of North Carolina,\" Allison said after the meeting. For their part, Burr and Tillis released a statement after the meeting: \"While we remain concerned with Ms. Lynch's stated desire to lead the Department of Justice in the same manner as Eric Holder and will not be supporting her nomination, we are grateful that the group came to Washington to talk about this issue and exchange ideas. Weeks later, the NAACP organized protests outside the senators' offices in Raleigh, Charlotte and Wilmington. \"I think there is a much deeper analysis,\" said North Carolina NAACP Branch President Rev. William Barber II.  \"I believe if she had been Clarence Thomas, she would have been confirmed.\" \"Because of her courage, her character and her commitment to the law and to the enforcement of the laws of this land, particularly the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution, and because her consciousness was shaped in the crucible of the civil rights movement -- that is what they fear,\" Barber said. Obama turns up the heat on Loretta Lynch confirmation 'limbo' Lorenzo Lynch says he carried his daughter to several civil rights marches on his shoulders.  He admits that he did not think that much of the recent progress of African-Americans was possible when he was fighting for equal rights. Now, his small living room is filled with stacks of loosely organized newspaper stories about his daughter's nomination and photos of his visit to the White House. Lynch admits that he's never told his only daughter that he's proud of her, although he's sure she knows it.  He plans to change that, soon, regardless of the outcome of her pending nomination.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nThere was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that Rolling Stone retracted on Sunday night -- a part of the story that was never disputed: The University of Virginia is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus. The school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it. The Virginia attorney general asked the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students. That includes how UVA officials handled the allegations in the discredited Rolling Stone article by a student the magazine called \"Jackie,\" especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out. The alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012, and Jackie told the university about it the next spring. She started telling her story very publicly, including at a \"take back the night\" rally. But Charlottesville police didn't hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014, in which Jackie claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face. When a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault, she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident. In both cases, police said Jackie refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case. But more women came forward to talk about their experiences -- women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as Jackie's. Rolling Stone's story opened up a conversation about the topic, and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims. Many women told CNN about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus. They'd call it a \"bad experience.\" Others told CNN that there were fraternities with reputations for being \"rapey\" and for using date-rape drugs. That some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman's outfit. And if a woman did report her rape, some women complained that the internal process didn't seem worth it if their abuser wouldn't be kicked out of school. Rolling Stone had a line in its original story: \"UVA's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998, 183 people have been expelled for honor-code violations such as cheating on exams. And yet paradoxically, not a single student at UVA has ever been expelled for sexual assault.\" After the article published, UVA admitted this and instituted a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward -- although that policy was never defined, so it's unclear what it means. When the story was deleted from Rolling Stone's website, that was lost. \"You lose a lot of other people's voices who were in that article,\" said Sarah Roderick, a survivor and UVA student, \"and a lot of good things that could have come about. Fixing problems with administration here and on our campus\" -- and, she added, across the nationo. Along with the O'Melveny & Myers investigation, there's also an open Title IX investigation into UVA by the U.S. Department of Education as a result of a civil suit. The attorney who filed the suit, James Marsh, told CNN that UVA medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he's representing, making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice. When the Columbia Journalism School's 12,000-plus-word critique is summed up, it really boils down to this: The mistake could have been avoided if the writer, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of Jackie who she claimed were with her that night. They'd later tell other media outlets, including CNN, that they remembered a very different story. Rolling Stone says their account would have been a red flag. And all three say they would have talked if they'd been called. Ryan Duffin, one of the trio, said he felt deceived by Jackie, but he also pointed out that Erdely's mistake in fact-checking was about one single incident, and the fallout has caused a much bigger issue to be lost. \"Had she gotten in direct contact with us, it probably wouldn't have been printed, at least in that way,\" he said. \"A lot of the article was still based in truth, but the focal point would have been different.\" It might have been less dramatic, but it would have probably focused on some of the other UVA students who shared much more common stories of acquaintance rape on campus. \"I think my problem with it was that this reporter wanted to sensationalize an experience that's not very common,\" Roderick said. \"... And I wonder if it would have been different if (it dealt) with someone with a less horrific story -- something that happens to more people. I think this discredits what a lot of survivors go through. Something this physically horrific is not what everyone goes through. Now it's like, 'If I wasn't assaulted by more than one man then my story is not as worthy of attention.' It's frustrating that this is how rape is portrayed on college campuses because this is not the norm.\" Before the report came out, Abraham Axler, the student body president, said that some good had come from the article because it forced UVA to institute new policies and to open up a conversation on a topic that needed to be discussed nationwide. But some survivors and advocates are afraid the retraction set back their progress. \"I do feel like there's a possibility people will be afraid to come forward. If you come forward and share your story, if you don't have the date right, every detail down, you'll think, 'I'm going to be accused of being a liar. It's easier for me to keep it to myself,'\" Roderick said. \"There are very serious and unresolved questions about the university's performance,\" said Steve Coll, dean of the Columbia School of Journalism. \"Rolling Stone teed that subject up. I wouldn't say that everything about Rolling Stone's treatment of that subject was perfect, but it certainly doesn't fall under the same category as their reporting about Jackie's narrative.\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 176 words:\nDanny Kahneman, my good friend and co-author who got a Nobel Prize in economics, once helped to run an experiment involving patients undergoing colonoscopies.  One group received a mildly pleasurable experience at the end of the procedure; the other group, which experienced the same type of colonoscopy, did not. It turns out that the group for whom things ended well had significantly more positive recollections of the whole affair from its beginning. The psychology of it is simple to understand: Happy endings matter. Even an unpleasant experience can lead to happy memories in hindsight if it ends well. So too with taxes. Let's just say that when it comes to taxes for the average American, \"stuff\" happens (keeping the colonoscopy metaphor running), paycheck to tax-reduced paycheck.  But recent statistics suggest that 8 out of 10 American taxpayers get a refund when they file their taxes, and the average amount is close to $3000. That pays for a lot of stuff. To make the good news even better, tax filing has gotten rather simple for most people, with various software and service providers offering to do the dreaded paperwork for free. No filing headaches and a check to boot. What's not to like? The fact of the matter is there is plenty not to like when it comes to the U.S. tax system. For example, the laws are biased against two-worker marriages; taxes go up when two relatively equal earners marry, as the rate brackets for couples are less than double that for single filers. Taxes are also overly complex and essentially optional for the truly rich, who make their wealth off of their existing wealth, the largely untaxed returns from capital, rather than by getting ordinary paychecks like most of us. But now is not the time to explain such serious matters; the people are too busy spending their refunds. The once dreaded Tax Day has become a happy spending spree for most Americans. This state of short-term bliss follows from some deep trends in our tax laws. In brief, the U.S. income tax system is increasingly a wage tax, with limited taxes on capital (what the rich have) and limited deductions for most of us.  For example, 3 out of 4 Americans using a standard deduction get no break for their charitable contributions. All of this has been hashed and rehashed by politicians, professors and pundits. But who has time for that? Let's go to our television sets and check out the commercials. One clever spot ran during the recent Super Bowl, suggesting that the Boston Tea Party -- a tax revolt -- could have been averted with free online filing, which the sponsor was eager to provide. Filling out 1040s was part of what made the income tax so odious for the masses for such a long time -- who doesn't remember our parents fretting over shoeboxes of receipts sometime in April, the cruelest month? Now as Tax Day approaches, we are flooded with advertisements about America getting its billions back, without even having to pay to prepare the forms. We get paid to play! Here is the happy ending that Kahneman and others have shown can mitigate the memories of unpleasantness past. The simple fact is that a simple tax is also rather simple to administer. Service providers kindly offer to help out the masses of befuddled Americans. Of course, these kind souls want their happy endings too. They are betting that once the large refunds become obvious to their customers, the grateful taxpayers-turned-consumers will happily purchase add-on services, such as \"audit protection insurance,\" or perhaps deposit the money in financial accounts managed by the provider. Just as lottery winners notoriously go on impulsive spending sprees, the \"found money\" of tax returns can finance many nice purchases. Of course, there are still those annoying matters of the deep unfairness of the tax laws, biased against modern families and wage earners, and in favor of the rich living off capital.  No real bother -- stuff happens. Let others fret about fairness. As long as our taxpaying or colon procedures end with a smile -- or a check -- who has time to dwell on the bad stuff that came before?\n\noutput:",

Most American taxpayers receive refunds, averaging around $3,000, making tax filing simpler with free software and services. Despite complexities and biases in the U.S. tax system, the happy ending of receiving a refund has turned Tax Day into a spending spree for many. Taxes have become more of a wage tax with limited taxes on capital and fewer deductions for most filers. Service providers offer add-on services to capitalize on taxpayers' gratitude for their refunds. While issues of tax fairness persist, the happy ending of a tax refund mitigates the unpleasant memories of the tax-filing process.",

The vast majority of the camp's occupants are from the town of Sinjar and fled the ISIS assault there back in August. But not everyone escaped. ISIS took thousands of Yazidis captive. Men faced a choice -- convert to Islam or be shot. But the Islamist militants separated the young women and girls to be sold as sex slaves. In its fourth edition of \"Dabiq,\" the ISIS online magazine, an article titled \"The revival of slavery before the hour,\" outlines the group's twisted justification and guidelines for the enslavement of the Yazidis. \"One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar (infidels) and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of Shariah,\" the article reads. We're told that women who have just given birth or are breastfeeding are considered impure and cannot be taken as sexual slaves -- but Hanan, 19, was neither of those things. \"They separated all of us,\" she says. \"They dragged us away by our hair. They took married women, young ones. The youngest with us was just 10.  We were all crying. \"They said we are going to marry you off, you will forget your family.\" ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK. For the first week, Hanan was held with 50 others, regularly beaten and threatened with torture, and fed just a bowl of rice. The group was then taken to a three story building in Mosul she described as a sex slave warehouse, where hundreds of girls and women were held. \"They would line about 50 of us up at a time, in rows of 10.  They would say don't move, don't cry or we will beat you. The men would come in and describe the kind of girl they wanted and then they would pick and choose as they pleased,\" she recalls. She was eventually chosen, part of a group of 25.  From that group Hanan was separated into a smaller group of seven and taken into a house in a village. 'Treated like cattle': Yazidi women sold, raped, enslaved by ISIS. Two ISIS fighters guarded the door and ordered the girls to clean and bathe themselves. \"They brought in a Yazidi girl who had been with them for two months. She was wearing the black niqab. They said to us we are going to do to you what we did to her,\" Hanan says. \"The girl spoke to us in Kurdish and said they beat me, they cuffed me and raped me.\" Hanan and the others decided they had to try to escape. That night they crawled out the bedroom window. \"The fourth girl jumped out, I was the fifth. I crawled to the wall and was about to jump over it and then I saw their flashlight,\" she tells me. \"They caught the last two girls.\" They ran, and somehow evaded capture.  Four hours later they were out of ISIS territory. \"If I just see someone with a beard I start shaking,\" Hanan says. Now physically free but mentally still captive, Hanan remains tormented -- like so many others, by what she has been through and what those still with ISIS are being forced to endure -- a fate worse than death. Fleeing ISIS -- A Yazidi family's tale.\n\noutput:",

The documents show Bates had one Taser training class over a six-and-a-half-year period, took three firearms training classes and qualified 10 times, from 2009 to 2014, to use a handgun. His evaluations say he got along with other officers and related well with the public. \"Robert Bates has met all the requisite training required by Oklahoma to be a reserve deputy,\" said the lawyer, Scott Wood, in an interview with CNN. Read the documents. CNN could not independently confirm the documents were authentic. Wood said he got them from Bates, who asked the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office to provide his training records. The sheriff's office has turned down CNN's requests for the training documents, saying they are part of the investigation. Authorities did not reply Saturday to a request for comment on Wood's statements. The documents are important because Bates' training has become a central issue in the case. The lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that Bates, 73, wasn't qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff. The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were told to forge Bates' records and were reassigned when they refused. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has denied these allegations. The documents provided to CNN cover the period from July 22, 2008, to December 12, 2014. Bates had one Taser training class, on March 4, 2009, according to a document with a heading from The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training, which sets the standards for training peace officers in the state. Wood said the council requires only one hands-on class on use of a Taser. Bates had weapons training once in September 2008 and twice in 2009, according to sheriff's office records that Bates obtained, Wood said. He scored high enough at the pistol range 10 times from September 24, 2009, to April 9, 2014, that he was allowed to carry a handgun while on duty, Wood said. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in the death of Eric Harris. Friends and family of Harris gathered in Tulsa on Saturday afternoon for a visitation and viewing. Bates is free on $25,000 bond. He says he meant to use his Taser on Harris during the April 2 arrest but accidentally fired his handgun instead. \"I shot him! I'm sorry!\" Bates is heard saying on video of the incident. Bates, an insurance company executive, has gone to his own defense. In an interview Friday with the \"Today\" show on NBC, Bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies. \"That is absolutely the truth. I have it in writing,\" he told the show. Questions have already been raised about Bates' training and when his service with the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office started. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he \"became an advanced TCSO Reserve Deputy in 2007.\" Wood said Bates started working for the sheriff's office in late 2007 or 2008. But the sheriff's office has said Bates had been a reserve deputy since 2008. Bates, who worked as a police officer for one year in the 1960s, completed 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience since becoming a reserve deputy, according to the sheriff's office. The Tulsa World said 480 hours of field training are required to be an \"advanced\" reserve deputy, which Bates claimed to be. Questions have been raised about Bates' firearms qualifications scores. To be allowed to carry a pistol on duty, deputies need to score 72 while firing at a silhouette of a man at the firing range, Wood said. Documents with a heading \"Firearms Qualification Record\" show Bates scoring at least 72 on six different days. But firearms qualification records from four dates in 2012 and 2013 are missing for the entire sheriff's office, Wood said. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office says it can't find the records. The department's summary of Bates' weapons training shows he scored 80-84 those four times. \"If you're going to forge somebody's score why not give them a 90 or a 95,\" Wood said. CNN provided the documents to the Tulsa World. Ziva Branstetter, an editor with the newspaper, said the new information doesn't undercut the World's reporting. \"These records back up the validity of our story and we stand by our story,\" she said Saturday. Another seeming oddity of the records is how many classes Bates took on two days. The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training records show Bates took 14 training classes worth 20 credit hours on December 10, 2013, and 20 classes worth 31 credit hours on December 11, 2014. Wood said Bates may have been cramming in his required training before the end of the year by taking computer classes. \"It's possible you could take a half-hour class and if you know the material you could finish it in 15 minutes,\" he said. Evaluations show supervisors had a good opinion of Bates. One from March 14, 2009, says of his strengths: \"Works well with his fellow officers and relates to the public very well.\" His weakness: \"Radio usage/geography.\" Remedial training: \"Does not have a lot of radio usage time which will be worked on. Will have to work on his geography skills. Both will be remedied in time!\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nDuhok, Iraqi Kurdistan (CNN)The children laugh and shriek, as some of them seem to always have the capacity to do no matter how depressing the circumstances. Their bright clothes provide splashes of color against the otherwise drab monotone white of the endless rows of tents. A small group plays with rocks, replacements for the toys they left behind when they fled, while others clamber through a jagged tear in the wire fence surrounding the refugee camp. The Shariya refugee camp opened around six months ago, made up of some 4,000 tents and counting. Thousands of Yazidis now call this corner of Iraqi Kurdistan home, about 18 miles (30 kilometers) from one of the front lines with ISIS, where one can hear the occasional reverberation in the distance of what we are told are airstrikes. The vast majority of the camp's occupants are from the town of Sinjar, which is near the border with Syrian Kurdistan, and fled the ISIS assault there back in August. But not everyone escaped. ISIS took thousands of Yazidis captive. The fighters separated the young women and girls, some as young as 8 years old, to be sold as slaves, for their \"masters\" to use as concubines. Men faced a choice: Convert to Islam or be shot. Mahmoud was out running errands when ISIS fighters arrived, taking his wife, Ahlam, their three children -- the youngest of which was just a month old -- and his elderly parents. \"They took our phones, jewelry, money,\" Ahlam recalls. \"They had guns. They forced us at gunpoint into big trailer trucks.\" They were taken to a school turned prison in Tal Afar. From there, the family was moved from village to village -- and at one stage taken to Mosul. \"They wrote everyone's name down and they asked where we want to work, in the fields, as cleaners or as herders,\" she says. Ahlam and her family chose to herd goats. They were then taken to a Shia village whose residents had fled, where they were part of a group of around 40 living in one house. In the home, Ahlam found a cell phone left behind by its former occupants and called her husband. \"I said we are alive but we are prisoners.\" Ahlam's husband, who up until that moment had lost the will to live, thinking his family was dead, says he cried out of happiness despite his pain. Ahlam would call when she could, briefly, after midnight, hiding under her bedcovers. If she was caught with a phone, she would be killed. The village itself was a massive prison, its entrances guarded by ISIS fighters. She recalls that two men, in their late 40s or 50s, tried to escape. When they were caught, their bones were broken, their bodies tied to the back of a truck and then driven through the streets. The Yazidi captives were forced to watch the gruesome spectacle. The men's corpses were then tossed into a ditch and an order given not to bury them. One night, some of the Yazidi men risked their lives to toss dirt onto the bodies, to give those slain what dignity they could. Ahlam tells us that about a week before we met, ISIS fighters came by and took away her in-laws and the other elderly people living in the house. \"We didn't know where they were taking them, we thought we would be next,\" she remembers. So she and the rest of the group realized that they had to try to flee. \"We decided that either we survive or we don't.\" They left at midnight. Ahlam cradled the baby, as her two other children, ages 3 and 4 years old, clutched at her clothes. She prayed the baby wouldn't cry, that the children could keep walking. They knew the general direction to take, but not the exact route, and they could only hope it was toward freedom. \"When the sun started to come up, I thought that's it, we are going to get caught,\" Ahlam says. \"And what am I going to do with the kids?  I can't carry all three of them and run.\" Luckily, Ahlam never had to answer that impossible question. The group made it into Iraqi Kurdistan. The couple can't put into words their emotions when they were reunited. Mahmoud, gently caressing his daughter's palm, says he could hardly believe that the woman whose stunning eyes and gentle words he had fallen in love with, and their three children, were by his side again. It had been eight agonizing months. But their joy was tainted by fear for Mahmoud's parents. A few days after Mahmoud and Ahlam were reunited, ISIS released 217 captives. No one is disclosing exactly why. Among them were 60 children, a handful of men and women, and the rest were elderly -- including Mahmoud's parents. \"We didn't know if they were going to slaughter us or what they were going to do with us,\" Mahmoud's father says. \"They moved us around a lot, and at one stage we stayed in in one place for three days.\" But Ahlam's parents are still with ISIS. Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi member of Iraq's parliament, speculates that the Yazidis ISIS released are individuals they were struggling to care for. Dakhil is part of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's delegation to the United States this week. She will be addressing the United Nations -- pleading for more international support for Iraq and more airstrikes to help defeat ISIS -- and she will address the plight of the Yazidis. \"We sometimes say that we wish we had been massacred. This would be better than being kidnapped and raped. We prefer death now over the fate of what is happening to these girls and women,\" Dakhil says. \"It is now on the government and on the international community to focus on this. How to get these captives back. It's inconceivable that in the 21st century, something like this is happening as if we were living in the Stone Age.\" Ahlam says she was spared because she was breastfeeding and she had young children, which, we're told, makes her impure and therefore unable to be used as a sex slave. For Ahlam, what she went through was not the hardest part of her ordeal. It's the moment when the ISIS fighters began taking away the girls and young women. She's haunted by their screams, the image of them being dragged away sobbing and screaming.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nSoon, America will be too fat to fight. Forget about rampant diabetes, heart attacks and joint problems -- the scariest consequence arising out of our losing battle with the bulge is the safety of our country. In about five years, so many young Americans will be grossly overweight that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. That alarming forecast comes from Maj, Gen. Allen Batschelet, who is in charge of U.S. Army Recruiting Command. Obesity, he told me, \"is becoming a national security issue.\" I was so taken aback by Batschelet's statement that I felt the need to press him. Come on! Obesity? A national security crisis? The General didn't blink. \"In my view, yes.\" Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country, only 72,000 qualified. Some didn't make the cut because they had a criminal background, or a lack of education, or too many tattoos. But a full 10% didn't qualify because they were overweight. Before you accuse me of sensationalizing, it's that 10% figure that worries General Batschelet the most. \"The obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction,\" he said. \"We think by 2020 it could be as high as 50%, which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the Army.\" He paused. \"It's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now.\" The problem is so worrisome for the Army that recruiters have become fitness coaches, like the trainers on the NBC show, \"The Biggest Loser.\" Yes, your tax dollars pay for Army recruiters to play Dolvett Quince or Jillian Michaels to whip could-be recruits into shape with the hope they can diet and exercise their way to become real recruits. If they lose enough weight, they're sent to boot camp. Some make it; many don't. But, General Batschelet told me the Army must try. \"We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,\" he told me. \"We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.\" Except the Army never considered the type of growth it's now contending with. Nowadays \"personal development\" means working on both character and ... girth. The general, along with so many others in this country, is struggling with why so many Americans, despite all the warnings, continue to eat too much and exercise too little. I have a theory. It ain't pretty. But it's got to be true: We just don't care. \"The acceptance of obesity is prevalent,\" according to Claire Putnam, an obstetrician and gynecologist who believes obesity is a national crisis right now. \"When you look around you, 70% of adults are overweight or obese. It's seems normal,\" she said. Just look at the numbers: More than one-third of U.S. adults are obese. Seventeen percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese. That's triple the rate from just a generation ago. So, maybe we should face the fact that we've grown comfortable with our girth. It is crystal clear we haven't the foggiest idea of who needs to lose weight and who doesn't. Just the other day, Twitter trolls scolded the singer, Pink, for gaining weight. Pink is not remotely fat. Neither is Selena Gomez, haters. Or Britney Spears, hecklers. If 70% of us are overweight in this country, why are there so many willing to fat-shame people who are not remotely obese? Maybe it's easier to criticize others for carrying extra weight than to admit we have a weight problem ourselves. Because it is abundantly clear we are wallowing in denial. Dr. Putnam points to one of Kaiser Permanante's medical questionnaires. You know, the paperwork patients are asked to fill out before they see the doctor. There is actually a box on the form that allows the patient to \"opt out of talking about obesity.\" Some patients refuse to step on the scale. \"You want to be sensitive to that patient,\" Putnam told me. \"You don't want to nag. But, doctors need to step in and say we need to fix this.\" CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, agrees with Putnam. \"Perceptions of weight are a big part of the problem,\" he said to me. \"If a person is overweight -- as difficult as it is -- they ought to be told. You know, this issue reminds me of the issue with concussions. We should call them what they really are: a brain injury, not 'getting your bell rung.' In the same vein, we should tell people who are overweight or obese that, clinically, they're 'overweight' or 'obese' and at risk for just about every chronic disease in the book.\" In other words, chubby is not the proper way to describe a person who is obese. Just like \"fat\" is not the proper term for Pink or Selena Gomez. And, yes, semantics matter. According to the CDC, 81% of overweight boys and 71% of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight. We've clearly lost our perspective on what's normal when it comes to a healthy weight. So much so it's becoming a national security problem. So what will it take? The answer cannot be the U.S Army.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The U.S. Army is facing a significant challenge due to the increasing obesity rate among young Americans. According to Maj. Gen. Allen Batschelet, head of U.S. Army Recruiting Command, obesity is becoming a national security issue as the number of qualified recruits is decreasing. In 2015, only 72,000 out of 195,000 young men and women who tried to join the Army qualified, with 10% of them being disqualified due to obesity. General Batschelet predicts that by 2020, as many as 50% of potential recruits could be overweight, leaving only 2 in 10 qualified to join. The Army has responded by having recruiters act as fitness coaches to help overweight recruits lose weight and qualify for boot camp. Dr. Claire Putnam, an obstetrician and gynecologist, believes obesity is already a national crisis, with more than one-third of U.S. adults and 17% of children and adolescents being obese. The acceptance of obesity in society, according to Dr. Putnam, makes it difficult for doctors to address the issue, with some patients refusing to acknowledge their weight problem or step on the scale.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nRelations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have always been thorny, but rarely has the state of affairs been as venomous as it is today. Tehran and Riyadh each point to the other as the main reason for much of the turmoil in the Middle East. In its most recent incarnation, the Iranian-Saudi conflict by proxy has reached Yemen in a spiral that both sides portray as climatic. For Riyadh and its regional allies, the Saudi military intervention in Yemen -- \"Operation Decisive Storm\" -- is the moment the Sunni Arab nation finally woke up to repel the expansion of Shia-Iranian influence. For Tehran and its regional allies -- including the Houthi movement in Yemen -- Saudi Arabia's actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable. And yet both sides have good reasons to want to stop the Yemeni crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war. When Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was elected in June 2013, he pledged to reach out to Riyadh. He was up front and called Tehran's steep deterioration of relations with the Saudis over the last decade as one of the principal burdens on Iranian foreign policy. From Lebanon and Afghanistan to Pakistan and the Gaza Strip, the Iranian-Saudi rivalry and conflict through proxy has been deep and costly. And yet despite Rouhani's open pledge, profound differences over Syria and Iraq in particular have kept Riyadh and Tehran apart. But if the questions of Syria and Iraq prevented a pause in hostilities, the Saudi military intervention in Yemen since late March has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels. Unlike in Syria and in Iraq, the Saudi military is now directly battling it out with Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen. While Riyadh no doubt exaggerates Tehran's role in the Yemen crisis, its fingerprints are nonetheless evident. \"Iran provides financial support, weapons, training and intelligence to Houthis,\" Gerald Feierstein, a U.S. State Department official and former Yemen ambassador, told a Congressional hearing last week. \"We believe that Iran sees opportunities with the Houthis to expand its influence in Yemen and threaten Saudi and Gulf Arab interests.\" The Iranians find the charges biased and point to the Saudi airstrikes in Yemen as a much bigger case of meddling in a neighbor's affairs. In Iran, the cue came from the country's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been unusually blunt. He tweeted: \"Despite disputes, the Saudis used to display composure [with] us but now inexperienced youngsters have come to power & replaced composure [with] barbarism.\" Three days after Khamenei's speech, Iran suspended religious pilgrimages to Mecca. This came as news broke about two Iranian teenage boys who had reportedly been sexually assaulted by the police while visiting Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, anti-Saudi protests have been staged in a number of Iranian cities. Khamenei's speech opened the floodgate of anti-Saudi statements. The voices of hardline figures in Tehran have been the most agitated. General Ahmad Purdastan, the commander of the Iranian ground forces, taunted the Saudis. \"Beware of the day when firecrackers explode in Riyadh,\" Purdastan said, in a not-so-subtle warning. But it was not only the hawks that came out swinging against the Saudis. Ayatollah Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and arguably Iran's most vocal advocate of better Iranian-Saudi relations. called Riyadh's military intervention a \"strategic mistake\" and urged for a political solution. Seeking a political solution is Iran's stated aim for the Yemeni crisis, but the prospects of such an effort succeeding are slim. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has provided a four-point plan: to get a ceasefire, to encourage the provision of humanitarian aid, to promote political dialogue among warring Yemeni parties, and to achieve the formation of an inclusive government. But the Iranian proposal also asks for an end to Saudi airstrikes. As Zarif put it, \"Iran and Saudi Arabia need to talk, but we cannot talk to determine the future of Yemen.\" The Saudis have thus far ignored the Iranian proposal. Meanwhile, the Houthi leadership has welcomed the plan. As one of its leaders said, \"In Iran's plan, unacceptable solutions do not exist.\" Not only do the Saudis not have any faith in any Iranian-drafted political package that is welcomed by the Houthis, but Riyadh believes that the international disposition favors it. Saudi Arabia was elated by the U.N. Security Council vote on 14 April that condemned the Houthi movement. Only Russia abstained. But a solution to the Yemeni crisis will not come from the U.N. The U.N. can provide a cover for Riyadh's military intervention, but it cannot secure it a military win. This leaves Riyadh with a fundamental question about how far it is willing to take its fight in Yemen. Saudi airstrikes alone will not finish off the Houthi movement and it allies in the Yemeni armed forces. It requires ground troops on a huge scale. Riyadh has tried hard to muster a military coalition that is willing to dispatch ground troops but its effort has so far been nothing short of a fiasco. The Pakistanis most famously turned down the Saudi request and let it be known that Yemen is a quagmire they can do without. Instead, Islamabad has asked Iran to push the Houthis for a political compromise that Riyadh can live with. The Turks were enthusiastic at first about stopping the Houthis -- but in his visit to Tehran last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made it clear that he has prioritized Iranian-Turkish trade relations over rivalry in Yemen, and emphasized a political solution for the Yemeni conflict. The Egyptians and the Jordanians are still supportive of Saudi efforts and claim publicly to be open to the idea of deploying military forces to assist Riyadh in Yemen. But whether they will go through with it is another matter. Egypt has a long list of problems of its own, including a bloody counter-terrorism campaign in Sinai that it cannot afford to lose, but also an eastern border with lawless Libya that is increasingly a new front in Cairo's fight against jihadists. It is hard to see how Egyptian General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi can commit troops to a Yemeni campaign that is not a direct threat to Egypt's security. The same kind of domestic realities, including the threat from ISIS, will also prevent Jordan from any significant contribution to Saudi military efforts in Yemen. These hard realities leave Riyadh with two options. It can look for or even mediate a political solution that will invariably include the same Houthis that Riyadh is attacking today. Alternatively, given the absence of willing states to contribute ground troops, Riyadh will have to contemplate a full-scale invasion of Yemen. That is scenario that is very hard to contemplate. The Iranians too are faced with stark choices. It is beyond Tehran's ability to tame the Yemeni crisis. As tempting as it might be for Tehran to see the Saudis bleed in Yemen, the danger of this conflict further fuelling sectarian tensions in the Middle East will undermine broader regional Iranian interests. A political compromise that both Riyadh and Tehran and their respective Yemeni allies can live with seems to be the only option that is not cataclysmic.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The relationship between Iran and Saudi Arabia has reached a new low point, with each side blaming the other for instability in the Middle East. The latest manifestation of this conflict by proxy is in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia views its military intervention as necessary to counter Iranian influence.

When Iranian President Hassan Rouhani came to power in 2013, he expressed a desire to improve relations with Saudi Arabia. However, deep differences over Syria and Iraq have kept the two apart. The Saudi military intervention in Yemen in March 2015 has raised the stakes, with direct fighting between Saudi forces and Iranian-backed rebels.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nWashington (CNN)In 2011, al Qaeda took Warren Weinstein hostage. Then, about a year later, his family paid money to his captors, said a Pakistani source who was in regular contact with the kidnappers. It did not lead to the American aid worker's release, and he was inadvertently killed in an anti-terror strike in January, the White House announced Thursday. After the transfer of funds in 2012, the captors, who never referred to themselves as \"al Qaeda,\" but instead as \"Afghans,\" began demanding prisoners be released in exchange for Weinstein, most prominently Dr. Aafia Siddiqui of Pakistan, the source said. She has been described as the \"poster girl\" for Islamic jihad and is serving an 86-year sentence in the United States. The militants also wanted the release of local militants who hailed from the Pakistani province of Waziristan, along the Afghan border, the source said. The men on the other end of the phone spoke Pashto with an accent typical for the border region. And they were professional in their dealings, said the source, who noticed a marked change after the money was paid. The people who had originally talked to the source about Weinstein vanished and were replaced by new voices on the phone. The militants also connected themselves with other terror events. After ISIS beheaded American James Foley, Weinstein's Afghan captors told the source that \"the Iraqis\" were asking for the American and that they were preparing an \"orange suit\" for him -- a reference to the suits that victims have worn when ISIS militants murdered them. When the Taliban released U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, a militant on the phone bragged to the source that he had been one of Bergdahl's kidnappers. They had said, at one point, that if they did kill Weinstein, they'd announce it in a big way, because he was too big a catch not to publicly celebrate. The captors had called the source daily since sometime in 2012, and the last time the source spoke with them, in early April, they said that Weinstein was still alive. In spite of a request for proof of life, the militants didn't give one. After that, the calls stopped. The source never had a number for the militants; they had always been the ones who called. The source declined to comment on the amount of money transferred to the captors, leaving the disclosure to Weinstein's family. Could Weinstein have been saved? Weinstein's family in Maryland was initially reluctant to take their case to Congress. Weinstein's wife, Elaine, and his two daughters worried that drawing attention to their loved one's plight -- especially media attention -- would make Weinstein, a government contractor working with USAID in Pakistan, a more valuable hostage to his al Qaeda captors. But the family switched course and went to their representatives in Congress in late 2013 after a video of Weinstein -- frail and apparently in declining health -- surfaced in which he said he felt \"totally abandoned and forgotten\" by his country. Will the drone debate return? More than a year later, that reluctance evolved into a close bond between the Weinsteins and the Maryland delegation of lawmakers and staff who pressed Weinstein's case with the Obama administration as well as Pakistan. The congressional offices helped the family navigate the maze of government agencies working to free their loved one, according to one of those lawmakers and a Senate aide. \"We don't get choked up too often at work,\" Algene Sajery said as she held back tears. \"But this is really hard.\" Sajery is a foreign policy adviser to Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, who worked closely on the case. After the White House announced that Weinstein had been accidentally killed in a January U.S. drone strike, the aide's first call was to Weinstein's daughters. \"Myself and my colleague worked really closely with them, talked to them all the time ... they're just such good people,\" Sajery said of the family. \"There's a personal connection there.\" Cardin and his staff had tracked the Weinstein case since news of his abduction surfaced in August 2011, but when the family reached out to get help pressing their case, Cardin's staff joined forces with Rep. John Delaney, the Weinsteins' congressman, and began setting up meetings for the family. Cardin's staff set up meetings for the senator and Weinstein's family with everyone from the U.S. special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan to the Pakistani ambassador in Washington. Cardin and Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, wrote to President Barack Obama, calling on the U.S. to beef up efforts to secure Weinstein's release and dedicate more resources to the cause. And the staff and lawmakers helped the Weinsteins weave through the network of agencies -- from the FBI to the State Department and the White House -- working to bring Weinstein home. \"We focused on making sure that the capabilities of the government was well coordinated,\" Delaney told CNN on Thursday. \"The government is a bureaucracy, and you have to make sure that it's working.\" But for the Weinsteins and the families of other American hostages held by terror groups abroad, the government hasn't always worked well enough -- a frustration that was palpable to the staffers on Capitol Hill who worked to help them. Al Qaeda hostage Warren Weinstein killed. \"Unfortunately, the assistance we received from other elements of the U.S. Government was inconsistent and disappointing over the course of three and a half years,\" Elaine Weinstein said in a statement Thursday. \"We hope that my husband's death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the U.S. Government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families.\" It's a criticism that has resurfaced as the families of American hostages were killed abroad spoke up and voiced their frustrations with what they characterized as insufficient U.S. government efforts to bring their loved ones home. Delaney was \"saddened, disappointed and outraged that our government was not able to bring Warren home,\" he said in a statement Thursday. And in an interview with CNN later in the day, he strayed away from blaming the Obama administration or people in various U.S. agencies, instead pointing the finger at a disjointed system. The Weinstein family's frustration with that system boiled over last summer when Bergdahl, the U.S. Army sergeant, was released by a Taliban-affiliated group in exchange for five Guantanamo Bay prisoners. The U.S. policy of not negotiating with terrorists appeared to have an exception. \"It's one of those things where it's both there's some hope, but at the same time it caused them some great frustration,\" Delaney recalled, saying the family asked: \"Why not Warren?\" But as the State Department called the Bergdahl exchange a \"unique situation,\" the Weinsteins' hopes were dashed. \"That's when they asked us to really step up our efforts,\" Sajery said. \"That's when they decided to really go public.\" Delaney introduced a resolution calling on the Obama administration to use all tools necessary to bring Weinstein home and make his return -- and that of other U.S. hostages abroad -- a top priority. Mikulski, Cardin and Sens. Dick Durbin and Mark Kirk of Illinois pushed a similar resolution in the Senate. And the Weinsteins took to the airwaves, with Alisa Weinstein appearing on CNN's \"AC360\" to make a public appeal for her father's release -- and for the U.S. government to do more to secure his freedom. \"My father is just as deserving of freedom as Sgt. Bergdahl, as are all of the Americans who are being held abroad,\" she said on CNN last June. \"You cannot distinguish between these hostages. ... They can't just pick and choose, decide that it works to get one person out and then leave everybody else there.\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Thursday said that \"significant resources\" were dedicated to try to free Weinstein and that \"as painful as it is,\" the U.S policy of not negotiating with terrorists would remain in place, arguing that removing that policy could promote kidnappings abroad and put more Americans at risk. And State Department acting spokeswoman Marie Harf said many officials at the department were in touch with the Weinsteins throughout the process. While the U.S. policy of not negotiating with terrorists would remain in place, the State Department is reviewing how it works to secure the release of American hostages held by terrorists abroad, she said. The White House announced the review last fall, which Obama ordered last summer after terrorists killed or kidnapped Americans abroad. Speaking at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Friday, Obama reiterated that the White House will review what happened. \"We all bleed when we lose an American life,\" he said. \"We all grieve when any innocent life is taken. We don't take this work lightly.\" Obama made to sure to praise the intelligence community overall, noting that much of their accomplishments remain classified, while only their failures become public. \"The world doesn't always see your successes -- the threats you prevent, or the terrorist attacks you thwart, or the lives that you save,\" Obama said. \"It can be frustrating sometimes, but that's part of the function of our democracy. But I know what you do.\" But Delaney, the Weinsteins' congressman, is revving up to push for more reforms that will make government agencies more effective at finding and freeing American hostages held abroad. Delaney on Thursday called on the government to streamline the efforts of various agencies and countries in the region that help the U.S. find American hostages -- an effort he's been pushing in recent months. The tragedy of Weinstein's death could be just the momentum needed to spur those reforms. \"I think that every single American wants any American held hostage returned,\" Delaney said. \"There's tremendous support to do more.\" On Friday, Elaine Weinstein said in a statement that the family has \"been moved by the tremendous outpouring of support from around the world.\" \"We appreciate the sympathy and condolences we have received from those who knew the Warren we loved so much as well as those who did not,\" the statement said. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of others who have been taken hostage around the world as they endure these terrible ordeals.\" CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad, Pakistan; Jeremy Diamond reported and wrote from Washington; Saima Mohsin reported from Bangkok. CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

Still, he was a big deal. That's the assessment of multiple sources on a man who may not have been well-known in the West, but nonetheless had a special role in the terrorist group. Farouq -- an American -- died in a U.S. counterterrorism airstrike in January, according to the White House. Two al Qaeda hostages, Warren Weinstein of the United States and Giovanni Lo Porto from Italy, were killed in the same strike, while Gadahn died in another U.S. operation that month. Before that, Farouq was the deputy emir of al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, or AQIS, a branch of the Islamist extremist group that formed in recent years. The branch made its presence known in September 2014, when militants infiltrated Pakistan's navy and tried to hijack one of its ships, according to the SITE Institute, which monitors terror groups. The group's spokesman, Usama Mahmoud, on Twitter compared the Pakistani naval officers involved in the attempted hijacking to Nidal Hasan, SITE reported. Hasan is the U.S. Army psychiatrist sentenced to death for killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas. Osama Mehmood, a spokesman for al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, said that Farouq and another top figure, Qari Abdullah Mansur, were killed in a January 15 drone strike in Pakistan's Shawal Valley.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nWarren Weinstein, who appears to have been the only American citizen held hostage by al Qaeda, was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike in January. But it didn't have to be that way. A senior U.S. official familiar with the handling of the issue told CNN that the U.S. government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73-year-old development expert's release, either directly to al Qaeda or through proxies in Pakistan. Another senior U.S. official told CNN that Weinstein's capture by al Qaeda made it hard for the United States to negotiate, even though proxies such as the Pakistani government have links to intermediaries who might have helped. A senior Pakistani official told CNN that after Weinstein was kidnapped, the Pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant Haqqani Network and to the Pakistani Taliban, which are both allied to al Qaeda, to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about Weinstein. According to the official, nothing came of those feelers. The senior Pakistani official says that during the past year Pakistani soldiers, who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of North Waziristan near the Afghan-Pakistan border where Weinstein was believed to be being held, went door-to-door looking for the American. Nothing came of this search either. On Thursday, the U.S. government announced that Weinstein had been killed in a \"counterterrorism operation\" in January, which is how the government often describes CIA drone strikes. According to New America, which tracks drone strikes in Pakistan, CIA drone attacks happened in Shawal, North Waziristan, on January 19 in which at least four militants were killed; also on January 15 in Tehsil Ladha, South Waziristan, in which at least five militants were killed; and on January 4 in Datta Khel, South Waziristan, in which at least eight militants were killed. It is in one of these strikes that Weinstein was almost certainly killed. Lt. Col. Jason Amerine, a planner on the U.S. Army staff, is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter's office, which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of American hostages held by al Qaeda and the Taliban. A plan was developed in the Pentagon to secure the release of Weinstein, according to a staff member on Hunter's committee. That plan was to release Haji Bashir Noorzai, a prominent and influential member of the Taliban who is in prison in the States on drug trafficking charges, in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Berghdal, who was held by the Taliban until last year; Taliban hostages Caitlin Coleman, a U.S. citizen, and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle; and Dr. Shakil Afridi, who spied for the CIA in Pakistan and was being held in a Pakistani prison, as well as Weinstein. It's not clear how far this plan of action went. Amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure. Hunter, a California Republican, released a statement Thursday, saying, \"The only government organization seriously developing options to recover Weinstein and others in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region was within the Pentagon -- led by war hero Jason Amerine.\" As an Army captain, Amerine led a small detachment of U.S. Special Forces into Afghanistan in November 2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States. The operation was instrumental in helping to topple the Taliban and to install Hamid Karzai as the new leader of Afghanistan. Who exactly carried out Weinstein's kidnapping from his house 3½  years ago in the Pakistani megacity of Lahore has until now not been clear. A senior Pakistani counterterrorism official told CNN that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, kidnapped Weinstein at his Lahore home on August 13, 2011. IMU is an Uzbek terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan. According to the Pakistani official, the leader of the Weinstein kidnapping cell was a relative of Tahir Yuldashev, the former IMU leader killed in a CIA drone strike in the Pakistani tribal regions in 2009. The initial lead that traced the Weinstein kidnapping to the IMU came from another high-profile kidnapping in Pakistan two weeks after Weinstein's abduction. Shahbaz Taseer, the son of a leading Pakistani liberal politician Salman Taseer -- who was killed by Pakistani militants eight months earlier -- was kidnapped in Lahore on August 26, 2011. At the scene of Taseer's kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and SIM card that eventually led Pakistani officials to focus on the IMU group in Lahore, according to the senior Pakistani counterterrorism official. The police subsequently arrested three Uzbeks and four Pakistanis who were part of the IMU cell that had carried out the Weinstein kidnapping. Members of the IMU cell told Pakistani interrogators that after they had kidnapped Weinstein they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi-conscious among three safe houses in Lahore. IMU members then took Weinstein to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan, a semi-autonomous region along the border with Afghanistan where al Qaeda and other militant groups are headquartered. There Weinstein was given or, more likely, sold to al Qaeda, according to the senior Pakistani official. Who was Warren Weinstein? Weinstein had spent his life helping others, working in the fields of aid and development. He held a doctorate in international law and economics from Columbia University and spoke more than half a dozen languages. After his capture, the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, demanded the end of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and the release of terrorists held in U.S. custody in exchange for Weinstein's freedom. On September 12, 2012, Weinstein appeared in a video produced by al Qaeda's production arm in which he said that the Obama administration had shown \"no interest in my case.\" He then appealed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from \"one Jew to another\" to intervene. The Obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy, which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by ISIS, al Qaeda or the Taliban. The key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the U.S. government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them. The CIA, for instance, is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations, while the FBI has responsibility for retrieving American hostages. Often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with Weinstein. The CIA could have exercised more due diligence knowing that Weinstein was almost certainly being held in North Waziristan. There are some solutions for these problems. First, families should be granted security clearances by the U.S. government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones. Right now, the U.S. government won't communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives don't have the requisite security clearances. Should families abuse their clearances, they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones, which is a strong incentive not to abuse them. Second, President Barack Obama should appoint a senior-level person, perhaps working in the White House on the National Security Council, to oversee the work of the CIA, FBI, State Department and the Joint Special Operations Command, which implements hostage rescues. All these organizations have key roles to play in getting American hostages home. That person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and \"de-conflict\" any potential issues, such as the ones that surfaced in the Weinstein case. Third, while the U.S. government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups, there is nothing in American policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of U.S. citizens, and this should be encouraged, even if there is some quid pro quo involved. This is what happened in the case of the American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, who was captured by al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria in 2012, but was released last year after the Qatari government intervened in his case. The Qataris have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in Syria, including the al Qaeda affiliate holding Curtis, and while Qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free Curtis, it's unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of al Qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys. Curtis' successful release could provide a ray of hope for U.S. citizen Caitlin Coleman and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle, who were captured by the Taliban in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through Afghanistan. A senior American official told CNN they are being held by the Haqqani Network. The Pakistani government has contacts with the Haqqani Network, and the U.S. government should ratchet up the pressure on the Pakistani government to secure the couple's release. In captivity, Coleman, who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage, had a child. The name of the child is unknown.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nA year ago Bloomberg published a story with the following headline: Mike Pence, a Koch Favorite, Mulls 2016 Run for President. The story ticked off items on Pence's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed Koch brothers, as well as other right-wing lobbying groups. Last August the Indiana governor was in Dallas for an Americans for Prosperity event; the group is backed by the conservative Koch brothers, and supported Gov. Pence's tax-slashing budget. Now, Pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians.  Why would Pence ignore the pleas of Indiana's Chamber of Commerce as well as the Republican mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill? Because there's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was Pence's way of shoring up his street cred. It is also the reason why Republican Jeb Bush, Pence's fellow White House hopeful, who is viewed as a little light in that category, was first to rush in to defend Pence and the law. One lesson here: Just because more than 70% of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70% of the country is happy about it. Backlash aside, the fact is Pence has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives. And while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump, the very public debate that now embroils him — and Arkansas Gov.  Asa Hutchinson, and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire Republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped. Pence: 'Was I expecting this kind of backlash? Heavens no.' For there is no way a Republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing LGBT rights, which unfortunately will turn numerous Americans into single-issue voters. I foolishly hoped the issue of LGBT rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election, overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy. Instead it looks like it's going to be dragged down to a replay of Pat Buchanan's \"cultural war\" speech, during which he told the 1992 Republican National Convention: \"We stand with (George H.W. Bush) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women\" and later followed with \"There is a religious war going on in this country. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the Cold War itself. For this war is for the soul of America.\" Progressives may enjoy watching Pence's temporary fall from grace, but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has indicated a federal ban on same-sex marriage is not off the GOP table. And even if you think neither Pence nor Bush nor Cruz will win the nomination, someone has to. In light of that, listen to conservative former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a potential 2016 candidate describing  conservatives' discomfort with same-sex marriage: \"It's like asking someone who's Jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli.\" Or Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal: \"I certainly will support Ted Cruz and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage.\" Or Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has a long history of fighting against same-sex marriage and civil unions. And Ben Carson said jail turns people gay, so there's that. Remember: Pence didn't act alone. He only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials. In fact, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, \"the Indiana RFRA [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate. Numerous other bills specifically single out the LGBT community for unequal treatment.\" Who supports, denounces Indiana law? Gallup Polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay-friendly, but the trend on the state level tells a different story. Perhaps we're witnessing the final gasp of long-ago biases. Or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated. Former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the first member of Congress to marry someone of the same sex while in office, said he believes Republicans want the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage to provide political cover in the GOP primary. \"We're winning,\" he told a crowd in Chicago recently while promoting his latest book. I guess if you look at where the country was on LGBT issues 10 years ago, we definitely are. That's assuming you are part of the \"we\" who believe LGBT people should have the same rights as their heterosexual/cisgender counterparts. But as the situation in Indiana has shown, \"winning\" should not be mistaken for having \"won.\" For it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so-called \"religious freedom\" bills snaking through red-state legislatures. Or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it's raised in a debate or at a campaign stop, especially with Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate. Pence, and to a lesser extent, Jeb Bush, may be toxic now but America has a short attention span. More importantly, they are not alone. Frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets, and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls. If that holds true in 2016, \"winning\" is going to feel very strange.\n\noutput:",

Here's how it's unfolding:. It started at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, when the moon began moving into Earth's shadow.  For the next hour and 45 minutes, that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time. The total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds, and NASA says that makes it the shortest one of the century. Watch it live on NASA TV.

Parts of South America, India, China and Russia also will be able to see the eclipse, but it won't be visible in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Africa or the Middle East. A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow. As the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color.  Why red? Because Earth's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light. Some people have nicknamed the effect the \"blood moon.\" NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a \"tetrad.\"  The first was on April 15, 2014. The second was in September 2014, the next is Saturday and there will be one more, on September 28.

At a ceremony honoring her life on the school's campus Friday afternoon, head coach Dan Benjamin said the toughest thing a coach has to deal with is a loss. The community had lost more than a player, he said. It lost a friend and a daughter. And it lost \"an unselfish angel.\" \"It's not often you get to celebrate a loss,\" he told the crowd as he struggled to hold in his tears. \"But today we celebrate a victory on how to live a life, through Lauren Hill. (No.) 22 you will be missed and remembered by so many.\" An assistant coach read a quote from Hill:. \"I encourage everyone to cherish every moment with no worry about the past or anxiety about the future. Because the next moment is never promised. Never leave anything unsaid. I have learned to see the blessings in every moment and through every struggle, no matter how tough it might be. Nothing holds me back from living my life and chasing my dreams. I always finish what I start and see it through to the end. Never give up on your dreams. Find something to fight for; I fight for others.\" Hill would go on to help raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research with the nonprofit group The Cure Starts Now.

She taught us that every day is a blessing, every moment a gift.\" Her principal at Lawrenceburg High School, Bill Snyder, announced her death to students Friday morning. \"Lauren's message was constantly positive,\" he told CNN. \"We all need to work together to beat obstacles. Not just cancer. In any situation we can be positive.\" As news of her death spread, social media lit up with messages honoring her life. NBA great LeBron James called her the \"true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership.\" \"The greatest accomplishment we can achieve as humans is to inspire many,\" Twitter user Just_AP wrote. \"Lauren Hill did that.\" NCAA President Mark Emmert said Hill's \"enthusiasm and strength were an inspiration not only to those who knew her best, but also to the millions of people she touched around the world by sharing her story.\" \"Lauren achieved a lasting and meaningful legacy, and her beautiful spirit will continue to live on,\" he said in a statement. Hill was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma in 2013 when she was a senior in high school. The rare brain tumor was inoperable, but Hill persisted in playing on her high school team despite chemotherapy treatments. \"I never gave up for a second, even when I got a terminal diagnosis, never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore,\" she told CNN affiliate WKRC-TV at the time.

That location is near the Cambridge Police Department headquarters. The remains at both locations belonged to the same victim, identified Monday as Jonathan Camilien, 26.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nMountaineers have returned to Mount Everest for this year's climbing season, resuming the quest to summit the world's highest peak after a deadly season last year. In 2014, the Nepal climbing season ended after a piece of glacial ice fell, unleashing an avalanche that killed 16 Nepalis who had just finished their morning prayers. The April 18 accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on Mount Everest. The deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the Sherpas and the dangers of climbing Everest. In order to reduce risks, the route through Khumbu Icefall, the notoriously treacherous path where the 16 were killed, has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer. \"They're going in the icefall and, as we found out on April 18, it's the most dangerous place,\" said Conrad Anker, a veteran climber who has been to Everest three times. \"They're exposed to the tumbling ice, hanging seracs above it. It's very, very dangerous. It's the most dangerous place I've been in the mountains.\" At this point in the season, climbing teams have not yet entered Khumbu Icefall, which is essentially a frozen river rapid with jagged pieces breaking off and moving. Nepal has issued 347 permits this year to climb Mount Everest, with 125 of them from the previously shortened season, according to the Nepal Ministry of Tourism.  It's a slight increase from the 334 who were given permission last year. The local Nepalese committee that determines the path up Everest announced in February that a different route had been selected. The climbers will now take a central route through the Khumbu Icefall, avoiding the area where the deaths occurred. The committee comprised of Sherpas voted to return to the central route for safety reasons. \"There will be little risk of avalanche than in the right or left,\" said Yangji Doma Sherpa, the spokeswoman for the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee. The central route had been used in the 1990s, but was abandoned in favor of a quicker route, she said. The new path means climbers will have to cross more crevasses, and use more vertical and horizontal ladders. The committee issued a recommendation that the weight of workers' gear be limited to avoid overloading the ladders. \"I think it will be an hour longer on the icefall,\" said Alan Arnette, who is blogging from Everest base camp this season. \"I don't think it will be game changer.\" But one company, Alpenglow Expeditions, said it would stop climbing from the Nepal side, where the climbers have to go through the icefall, in favor of the northern route from China. \"We've seen it get progressively more dangerous over the last few years,\" said  Adrian Ballinger, the company's founder and CEO. \"We believe the risk is too great for our workers.\" According to the China Tibet Mountaineering Association, 320 people have been registered to climb the northern route to Everest this year. That's 136 more than last year. The Chinese side of Everest has typically been less popular than its Nepal counterpart, because of concerns of government closures. Some Everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain, but it also doesn't have an icefall. The increasing popularity of the northern route has caused concern amongst Nepali companies that climbers will divert to the Chinese side. \"I can already see the shift with mountaineers I speak to,\" said Dawa Steven Sherpa, who is based in Nepal. \"More people are going to go to Tibet than Nepal. Nepal needs the tourism far more than China does. China has incredible wealth of resources and Nepal does not.\" Leading expeditions is how Sherpas feed their families and send their children to school. Nepal depends heavily on tourism dollars. Many of the guides had to bury their friends after the accident last year, and while they may be ready to return to the summit, their families are not. Many of them are \"leaving behind nervous, stressed-out wives and children,\" whose memories of what happened last year are fresh, said Dawa Sherpa, managing director of Asian Trekking. \"They do say they don't want to put them through that again,\" he said. \"They're not fearful for their own lives, it's what they're putting their family through.\" Several mountaineers are also returning this year. One of them is Jon Reiter, who spoke to CNN last year after the tragedy. When the icy avalanche thundered down, Reiter was shoved behind an ice block by his Sherpa guide. Reiter, who is making his way to base camp this year, could not be reached directly. But he explained why he's heading back to Everest this year on his blog. \"I can't quite find the words to tell you why, or what really pulls me back to the mountains,\" he wrote. \"When we were in the midst of last year's events it was hard to see the big picture. It was hard to remember that people die in the mountains but that it's more rare than not. \"It was hard for me to remember that I'm not choosing between my life at home and dying in the mountains. I like to think it's similar to surviving a plane crash or a major pile up on the freeway.\" CNN's Sugam Pokharel contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

Now, Copenhagen residents can live in a new neighborhood set to emerge on the historic grounds of the famous beer-maker in the heart of Danish capital. The area in question -- aptly named Carlsberg City -- has been home to the famous Carlsberg brewery since 1847, and with it a big slice of Danish cultural history. But the brewery has moved on and the future is moving in. Amidst the district's historic treasure trove of protected architectural buildings will be some 600,000 square meters (6.4 million sq ft) of residential, business, sporting, cultural, and educational space. Prices range from just below Copenhagen's average $5,000 per square meter to about $12,000 -- well below other major European cities. Modeled after intimate medieval towns, Carlsberg City won \"Best Master Plan\" at the World Architecture Festival in 2009. The project has since attracted interest from all over the world. \"Scandinavia has over the past years been attractive to foreign investors,\" said Claus Lonborg, CEO of Copenhagen Capacity, a non-profit with the aim of growing business in the Danish capital. He added that \"given the number of infrastructure and construction developments taking place in the greater Copenhagen area now, we really see an increasing demand and interest.\" While the first apartments in Carlsberg City went up for sale in March, the area has been alive for years. Investors invited temporary renters into old buildings during the construction phase which began shortly after the 2008 financial crisis hit. The area has since been home to skateboarders, bikers, modern dancers, cafes, the national football team for homeless people and a climbing forest. And the head of Carlsberg City says this ploy has more than paid off. \"The temporary activities have been keeping Carlsberg City on the landmap even in planning,\" said Jens Nyhus, CEO of CarlsbergByen (Carlsberg City). \"When the financial crisis started (they) were a way to keep the building occupied and from running down. It kept the city alive and opened up.\" But just because new tenants have moved in doesn't mean it's brewing history will be gone completely. Carlsberg will remain very much inside Carlsberg City, making specialty beer and building a tourist center that is expected to attract half-a-million visitors per-year when it opens in 2017. \"We call it Carlsberg brand and experience center,\" said Thomas Kjelfred, communications consultant at Visit Carlsberg. \"(But) it's not a brand house, it's a brew house. Until six years ago, we brewed 200 million liters a beer (here)\" \"To a Dane, Carlsberg is more than a beer. It is art, it is science, it is culture.\" And soon, it will also be a city.\n\noutput:",

A new CNN/ORC poll finds 57% feel businesses such as caterers or florists should be required to serve gay or lesbian couples just as they would heterosexual couples, while 41% say they should be allowed to refuse service for religious reasons. That's a shift from a Pew Research Center poll conducted last fall, which found just 49% thought businesses ought to be required to serve same-sex couples while 47% that they should be allowed to refuse service on religious grounds. Since the Pew poll last fall, Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed into law in late March by Republican governor Mike Pence, sparked a nationwide controversy over whether the law allowed wedding-related businesses to refuse service to gay and lesbian couples. Apple, Walmart and the NCAA all spoke out against the law, while some states and cities with Democratic leaders barred spending public money in Indiana. Pence and other Indiana legislators insisted discrimination was not the law's intent and a bill to change the original law was signed in early April. In the CNN/ORC Poll, most Democrats (70%) and independents (60%) say wedding-related businesses should be required to provide services to same-sex couples as they would different-sex couples, while Republicans break broadly the other way, 67% say religious reasons are a valid justification for refusing service. Full poll results. Looking at Republicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party, 60% in that group say wedding-related businesses should be allowed to refuse services to same-sex couples, but there are sharp divides within that group by age and ideology. Moderate and liberal Republicans and Republican-leaners broadly say wedding-related businesses should be required to serve all couples the same way (58%) while three-quarters of conservative Republicans favor allowing a caterer or florist to refuse service for religious reasons (74%). Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents under age 50, 56% say wedding-related businesses should be required to serve same-sex and different-sex couples the same way while among those age 50 or older, 72% think they should not be required to do so. The big gay wedding cake quiz. Age differences hold across party lines, but the generation gap among Republicans and Republican-leaners is larger than that among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Overall, white evangelicals are broadly in favor of allowing businesses to refuse service for religious reasons - 62% say they should be able to. But among whites who are not evangelicals, 61% say such businesses should be required to provide services to all couples the same way. The shift from the Pew Center results comes across demographic lines. Men, women, whites, younger adults and senior citizens all are more apt than in the Pew poll to say wedding-related business should be required to serve same-sex couples as they do others. The CNN/ORC International poll was conducted by telephone, April 16-19, among a random national sample of 1,018 adult Americans.

How can the people in Iowa and New Hampshire get to know the \"real Hillary,\" the Midwestern Methodist? (As a friend told me, she's someone who \"likes to sing 'God Bless America' on New Year's Eve.\") And how to open the minds of people about someone everyone already has an opinion about? Same questions, no doubt, that the staff asked in 2008 when she ran against the newbie Barack Obama, and same questions they asked when, as first lady, she ran for the Senate in New York. In that race, she ended up spending a lot of all-ears quality time in upstate New York. In this race, she could be spending a lot of all-you-can-eat time at Diners, Drive-ins and Dives — just like the TV show. (Except Guy Fieri would probably have been recognized by the crowd at Chipotle. Just sayin.' ) Dining aside, it's hard -- almost impossible -- to soft-launch a campaign with a superstar politician.  All the gauzy ads and the small classrooms and the coffee shops can't mask the Houdini-like effort Hillary Clinton is making to escape the inescapable reality -- that even her \"Scooby-Doo\" van is followed by throngs of press. (I half imagined an O.J. moment with a helicopter hovering as she made her way down I-80.) Try as she might to launch with a humble start — not entitled to anything — she still is who she is. Virtually unchallenged. Not to mention famous, accomplished and controversial. In watching it all unfold, it's hard to underestimate the task at hand. It's also hard to figure out whether it's actually going to work. Hillary Clinton — and her experienced campaign team — are disciplined and relentlessly on message. That's usually a good thing when you're running a presidential campaign. But when you're sitting at a community college in Iowa and you tick off your rationale for running and your resume — unprompted — it seems less effective and more oddly incongruent. (Especially when the former secretary of state described her tenure in five words — as \"standing up for our country.\" Short shrift, it seems to me.) Maybe it's that the old lessons of message discipline don't work in the informal environment the campaign is trying to create — at least not with this candidate. The hardest combination in politics is that just-right mixture of spontaneity and discipline. The ability to understand exactly what you have to say (over and over) and then say it as if you have never said it before. And look like you're having a great time doing it. We like to call it authenticity, but it's probably not. It's a honed skill that combines connection and gravitas, both of which the voters demand in a president. (A majority of voters -- 53% --  say they want to vote for someone who has been financially successful, as opposed to someone who has not.) So there's this balance: If you're too much like them, you're nothing special to vote for. But if you're too different, you're not relatable. It's a balance that doesn't come easily to Hillary Clinton. But she's not alone. When President George H.W. Bush was running for re-election in 1992, he was facing his own image issues. His populist challengers were calling him insensitive to middle class woes in the struggling state of New Hampshire. Bush tried mightily to drop the presidential persona, did some town halls, and famously declared:  \"Message: I care.\" Some said he actually read it from a cue card, but he also said this: \"I don't know what I have to do to convince people here that I really care about this (the economy). I do.\" He lost. To an empathetic I-feel-your-pain Bill Clinton. And the rest, as they say, is history. Or, in Hillary's case, at least trying to make history.\n\noutput:",

From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy. According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea. CNN's Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

It was a call to action: Within hours of the first 7.8 magnitude quake, India began planning a massive cross-border aid mission. With each hour, the scale of the devastation in Nepal became clearer -- some 3,862 people are known to have died so far -- and plans in India, where 72 people were also killed, got bigger. On Sunday alone, India delivered 187 tons of supplies, including 50 tons of water, 22 tons of food and 2 tons of medicine. And there will be more to come. Hundreds of trained disaster relief troops landed in Kathmandu and quickly got to work. With each flight in, there was a flight back out, packed with Indians and other nationals escaping to safety: 2,000 and counting have fled so far. By Monday, India was in full-scale crisis mode: From airports across India, planes flew in loaded with aid, and trucks made the trip by land from India's east, aiming for more remote areas. On the ground: Devastation in Nepal. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a special effort over Nepal. He has visited the country twice in his first year in office. And on Sunday, in his national radio address to the nation, he said Indians needed to \"wipe the tears of every Nepali, hold their hands, and stand with them.\" It all highlights the more proactive role taken by India in recent months. Just weeks ago, India flexed its military muscle to rescue Indians and other nationals from conflict-torn Yemen. Now, it is taking the lead in Nepal. Some might say India's friendship is a signal for the other big country that shares a border with Nepal: China. A display of hard power, perhaps to achieve enduring soft power in the region. But in times like this, help is always welcome. First there's the immediate search and rescue operation, and then the long process of rebuilding work. Nepal will need India's friendship -- as well as China's -- for many long months ahead.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nFor years, Warren Weinstein's family frantically searched for details about his whereabouts and pushed for his release. His wife said she was still searching for answers Thursday after U.S. officials revealed the 73-year-old American aid worker had been accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike targeting al Qaeda. \"We were so hopeful that those in the U.S. and Pakistani governments with the power to take action and secure his release would have done everything possible to do so, and there are no words to do justice to the disappointment and heartbreak we are going through,\" Elaine Weinstein said in a statement. \"We do not yet fully understand all of the facts surrounding Warren's death, but we do understand that the U.S. government will be conducting an independent investigation of the circumstances.\" Gunmen abducted Weinstein in 2011 from his home in Lahore, Parkistan. They posed as neighbors, offered food and then pistol-whipped the American aid worker and tied up his guards, his family said. Just a few months after Weinstein's capture, al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a recording claiming the terror group was holding Weinstein -- and demanding, among other things, that the United States end airstrikes in Pakistan. U.S. officials called for his release but repeatedly said Washington wouldn't bargain with al Qaeda. Weinstein -- a husband, father and grandfather from Rockville, Maryland -- was 73 years old when he was killed, according to a family website detailing information about his case. He worked in Pakistan as a contractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development from 2004 to 2011, the website says. His employer, Virginia-based consulting firm J.E. Austin Associates Inc., described him as a world-renowned development expert. \"Warren spent his entire life working to benefit people across the globe and loved the work that he did to make people's lives better,\" his wife said Thursday. He loved the Pakistani people and their culture, she said, learning to speak Urdu and doing \"everything he could to show his utmost and profound respect for the region.\" As he announced Weinstein's death Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama praised what he said was Weinstein's lifelong dedication to service, first as a Peace Corps volunteer and later as a USAID contractor. Weinstein, Obama said, was someone who \"willingly left the comforts of home to help the people of Pakistan,\" focusing his work on helping families escape poverty to give their children a better life. \"This was a man who basically dedicated his life to service, to people in general, but especially to people in a country where the standard of living was low and difficult. ... It's tragic that he was killed the way he was,\" former U.S. Ambassador Dan Simpson said. Simpson met Weinstein in 1968 when they were both working in Burundi -- Simpson as a diplomat and Weinstein as a scholar researching several books. Weinstein \"was a very kind person,\" Simpson said, \"and someone who was very sensitive to the needs of the people who he worked with.\" Another hostage was also killed in the January operation, Italian aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto. U.S. officials knew they were targeting an al Qaeda compound in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region in the January counterterrorism operation, Obama said, but they didn't know that the hostages were also there. Both Lo Porto and Weinstein were people who \"believed passionately\" that they could make a difference, Obama said. \"There could be no starker contrast between these two selfless men and their al Qaeda captors,\" Obama said Thursday. \"Warren's work benefited people across faiths. Meanwhile, al Qaeda boasted to the world that it held Warren citing his Jewish faith.\" Weinstein's health had been deteriorating, Obama said. Last year daughter Alisa Weinstein told CNN her father suffered from a heart condition and severe asthma. But it was still an optimistic time for the family. That month captors released U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, and that buoyed hopes from Weinstein's family that he could also be freed. \"They have shown with this exchange that they can get this done. If they want to, they can do this,\" Alisa Weinstein said at the time. \"So I know that they can do it for us and they can do it for others.\" But a prisoner swap never happened for Weinstein, even though his family pushed for one. Al Qaeda released a video of Weinstein on Christmas 2013. He appeared gaunt and said he was suffering. \"Needless to say, I've been suffering deep anxiety every part of every day, not knowing what is happening to my family and not knowing how they are and because I am not with them,\" Weinstein said in the video. At the time, a former colleague and friend said his appearance in the video was jarring. \"Quite honestly, I didn't recognize him in the picture,\" Laurie Wiseberg told CNN. \"He has changed so dramatically from the person he used to be in terms of appearance and I would hope something could be done so he has a chance to be reunited with his family, his wife, his children and grandchildren, and not have to die in a foreign country far away from those he loves.\" At the time, The Washington Post also reported that it had received a letter from Weinstein. The letter, which was also posted on the website of the SITE Intelligence group, described his background doing human rights work. The letter said that before becoming a consultant in 2003, Weinstein had worked as a college professor at the State University of New York - Oswego, as a Peace Corps country director in Togo and Ivory Coast and for USAID and the World Bank. \"I hope that the media can mount a campaign to get the American government to actively pursue my release and to make sure that I am not forgotten and just become another statistic,\" the letter said. \"Given my age and my health I don't have time on my side.\" Weinstein's wife's statement on Thursday thanked some but also blasted the governments of the United States and Pakistan for not doing more to help her husband. While Maryland members of Congress -- Rep. John Delaney, Sen. Barbara Mikulski and Sen. Ben Cardin -- and members of the FBI were \"relentless\" in efforts to free her husband, she said others in the U.S. government were \"inconsistent and disappointing over the course of 3½ years.\" \"We hope that my husband's death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the U.S. government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families,\" she said. Pakistani government and military officials also should have done more, she said. \"Warren's safe return should have been a priority for them based on his contributions to their country, but they failed to take action earlier in his captivity when opportunity presented itself, instead treating Warren's captivity as more of an annoyance than a priority,\" she said. \"I hope the nature of our future relationship with Pakistan is reflective of how they prioritize situations such as these.\" But ultimately, she said her husband's captors are the ones responsible for his death. \"I can assure you that he would still be alive and well if they had allowed him to return home after his time abroad working to help the people of Pakistan,\" she said. \"The cowardly actions of those who took Warren captive and ultimately to the place and time of his death are not in keeping with Islam and they will have to face their God to answer for their actions.\" Opinion: Could Weinstein have been saved? CNN's Elise Labott, Jim Sciutto and Pamela Brown contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

In a two-hour special that aired Friday, the Olympic gold medalist and \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians\" star said he has the \"soul of a female\" even though he was born with male body parts. Thompson, who had two sons with Jenner during their five-year marriage, was one of many relatives to cheer Jenner for publicly sharing what she had known for decades. \"I have respectfully kept his secrets private and would have taken his confidences to my grave had he not spoken out,\" she said in a column for the Huffington Post. \"He can finally realize his need to be who he authentically is, who he was born to be. That takes tremendous courage. For that I commend him.\" Thompson wrote that she would not have married Jenner if she had known about his \"gender issue\" when they first met. But she's glad she didn't know because she would have missed the chance to share a life with him, including their two sons. \"Looking back, I'm so grateful to God, the universe, and Bruce that I didn't know, and that Bruce played the role in my life that he did,\" she said in the column. The two met in 1979 at a celebrity tennis tournament at the Playboy Mansion, while Jenner was in the process of separating from his first wife. The two married on January 5, 1981, and made Hawaii their home. Their first son, Brandon, was born in 1981, followed by son Brody in 1983. \"The Bruce I knew back then was an easygoing, down-to-earth, casual, romantic, good and loving man. I was extremely happy to have found such a remarkable partner with whom to share my life. I found him to be honorable and, well, just too good to be true. Just too good to be true indeed,\" she wrote. They were a celebrity \"glamour couple\" of the time, appearing regularly on red carpets, hosting charitable fundraisers and traveling the world together for their careers. Jenner's star grew, and was a man that other men aspired to be, and someone women wanted to be with. \"The Bruce I knew back then was unstudied, affable, and seemingly very comfortable in his own skin. So it seemed.\" Thompson said Jenner told her in 1985 that, despite it all, \"he identified as a woman\" and hoped to move forward with the process of becoming a woman.\" Confused and desperate, Thompson suggested therapy to help her understand what he was going through and \"determine if it was something we could overcome or 'fix.'\" \"I was pretty ignorant of the fact that being transgender isn't something that can be overcome, fixed, prayed away, exorcised or obliterated by any other arcane notion,\" she said. He considered traveling out of the country for gender-confirmation surgery and returning to the United States identifying as female, where his children could meet him as \"Aunt Heather.\" They separated after going to therapy for about six months and Jenner began taking female hormones and removing his hair through electrolysis. As he started developing breasts, his children began to notice -- a claim that Jenner also made in his interview. Thompson says Jenner did not remain a presence in their lives after he married Kris Kardashian, mother of Kim, Khloe, Khourtney and Rob Kardashian. Together, the couple had two children, Kendall and Kylie. Thompson said she forgives Jenner for those years. He has already \"been held prisoner in his own flesh\" and hopes that his life will get easier now.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nCiudad Juarez, Mexico, was once known as the murder capital of the world. Back in 2010, at the height of cartel violence, the city averaged 8.5 killings per day. But five years later, local officials say the city is much safer, and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to Juarez. This month the city launched the tourism campaign \"Juarez is Waiting for You.\" The rebranding effort started quietly a year ago, and on April 10, it was on full display. Mayor Enrique Serrano officially kicked off the campaign, giving what he called an \"unprecedented\" high-profile tour to regional leaders from the United States and Mexico. U.S. Rep. Robert \"Beto\" O'Rourke of Texas was one of those on a leg of the Juarez tour. His congressional district includes El Paso, Texas, which sits directly across the Rio Grande. O'Rourke says there's good reason for locals to be hopeful. \"As a region, El Paso and Juarez represent 20% of all U.S-Mexico trade. The binational ties are strong and have remained strong,\" O'Rourke says. \"Yes, we had a really difficult time for a ... period. Juarez was at one time the deadliest city in the world.\" O'Rourke speaks of a time between 2009 and 2012 when men, women and children were killed indiscriminately. Many were helplessly caught in the cartel violence. Others were victims of the drug turf war. It wasn't that long ago, O'Rourke says, that he thought twice about crossing the bridge into Juarez. \"(Now) I travel to Juarez regularly to have lunch or meet people or just to go. I always feel safe and secure.\" A spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN that at one point, there were days when Juarez had more than 20 killings. \"That was normal,\" spokesman Julio Castaneda told CNN. \"It's safer now.\" The numbers from the attorney general's office seem to bear that out. More than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago, but so far this year there have been 89 killings, according to Castaneda -- a dramatic decrease in the violence. \"Undoubtedly, the work we did here in the past year with the police institutions, and specifically the local police, helped. There was a coordinated effort between agencies,\" Castaneda said. \"Without a doubt this work played a part in breaking apart the gangs that were plaguing the city.\" The government cleaned up corruption within the local police force, and fired or arrested a lot of bad cops who were helping the cartels. Another factor that may have helped: The turf war between the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels essentially ended, with the Sinaloa cartel claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in Juarez. O'Rourke argues that the El Paso-Juarez border is \"safer than it's ever been.\" He cites the \"30 million lawful crosses from El Paso into Juarez\" last year as a symbolic step. Yet there are those who don't want to celebrate too soon. \"For Juarez to be considered a safe city, there's a long way to go,\" says Sergio Meza, executive director for Plan Estrategico de Juarez, an independent organization that works to improve the city's quality of life. \"Just this past year (in 2014) there were 424 homicides. In 2007, there were 272. Yes, we're not as bad. But we're still very sick,\" Meza told CNN from his office in Juarez. \"In reality, we're progressing from the conditions that were generated by the insecurity. We're still working out the corruption in the city. It's still an issue here.\" With more than 40% of Juarez living below the poverty line, according to Plan Estrategico de Juarez, the future of the city will depend on \"the people's participation in public matters.\" In fact, the organization's slogan is \"Nothing is fixed alone. Participate.\" \"We are looking at a compromised future,\" Meza said. \"We don't talk about that. We don't have the money to generate work here.\" One bright spot: U.S. investment is making a comeback. American companies Delphi, Honeywell, Flextronics and Lear are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in Juarez over the last year. That hiring would have been hard to imagine four years ago. But with the average salary at $20 per week for local workers in the maquiladores, or factories, along the U.S.-Mexico border in Juarez, Meza says more needs to be done. The scars from the recent past remain. Several buildings downtown are shuttered and marred by graffiti. Americans who, before the violence, came to Juarez for bargain shopping have not returned in the numbers seen before the spike in violence. But in a sign of progress, the U.S. State Department amended its travel warning for the city. While it still urges visitors to exercise appropriate caution, it's no longer telling people not to come. Longtime residents of Juarez and neighboring El Paso may be reluctant to say the wounds of the violent past have altogether healed. In the last year, however, they have definitely noticed that \"life is back.\" \"I measure it by the everyday coming and going of people,\" Gustavo Reveles, 39, told CNN. \"For someone who grew up on the border and for someone who spent half of his life crossing the border on a weekly basis, it's encouraging to be crossing back to Juarez without that sort of hesitation or worry that something might happen.\" Reveles lived in Juarez until he was 15 and now lives in El Paso. He says the threat of violence is \"still a little bit concerning,\" though that hasn't stopped him in recent weeks from going to Juarez to meet friends for dinner and drinks. \"Things have changed,\" he said. \"To go through what Juarez went through, you see life there again. You see a semblance of what was there before. To really recover and heal wounds, there's a long way to go, but the process has started and that's a step in the right direction.\" CNNMoney's Octavio Blanco contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

The spacecraft  that lost contact with flight controllers will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere in about a week, Roscosmos, the Russian Federal Space Agency, said Wednesday. \"Roscosmos (the Russian Federal Space Agency) announced that the Progress will not be docking and will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere,\" Kelly said from the space station. The Progress resupply vehicle will come off its orbit and will begin its combustion in the atmosphere between May 5 and May 7, according to Roscosmos. The Progress vehicle does not present any danger to the International Space Station due to a significant difference in orbit, Roscosmos added. The Russia space agency said it is working on its next supply flight to the ISS and expects to launch a new Progress ship in the third quarter of this year. Russia lost contact with ISS Progress 59 during a resupply mission to the International Space Station. The ship is now spinning out of control, NASA said. Even if Russia hadn't lost contact with the craft, the original plan was for Progress to burn up re-entering Earth's atmosphere -- albeit with garbage rather than a full load of equipment for the space station. According to NASA information on the Progress resupply vehicle, \"After the cargo is removed and before the Progress undocks, the crew refills it with trash, unneeded equipment and wastewater, which will burn up with the spacecraft when it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere.\" The cargo spacecraft launched successfully early Tuesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. But after it separated from the Soyuz booster rocket's third stage, Russian flight controllers were unable to confirm the health of all the spacecraft's systems, including the deployment of navigational antennae, NASA said. \"The spacecraft made another pass over Russian ground stations and continued to experience telemetry problems regarding the deployment of navigational antennas and the pressurization of the manifolds in the propulsion system,\" the American space agency said in an update. A planned rendezvous with the ISS six hours later was initially postponed to Thursday but has now been canceled, NASA said in its latest update. \"Docking has been called off for the Progress 59 spacecraft,\" it said. \"Russian flight controllers are continuing to assess the vehicle and what the plan going forward will be. Additional information will be provided as it becomes available.\" Few details have been forthcoming so far from Roscosmos. According to NASA, the cargo ship is carrying more than 3 tons of food, fuel, oxygen, spare parts and scientific experiment hardware for the space station. But the hitch will not put the six ISS crew members at risk, NASA said. \"The spacecraft was not carrying any supplies critical for the United States Operating Segment (USOS) of the station,\" a statement said. \"Both the Russian and USOS segments of the station continue to operate normally and are adequately supplied well beyond the next planned resupply flight.\" That next flight, which will be the seventh SpaceX commercial resupply services mission to the space station, is not scheduled  to take off before June 19, NASA said. Meanwhile, Russian flight controllers continue their efforts to make contact with Progress 59 as it passes over Russian ground stations. NASA said Tuesday that Russian flight controllers had \"confirmed that the vehicle had entered into a slow spin and have issued commands to attempt to control it.\" According to Russian state news agency Tass, six attempts to make contact were to be made Wednesday. The U.S. supplies on board the spacecraft include spare parts for the station's environmental control and life support system, backup spacewalk hardware and crew clothing, \"all of which are replaceable,\" NASA said. U.S. astronaut Terry Virts, from Maryland, is the current space station commander. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Suzanne Presto and Amanda Barnett contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

When you're exploring the fields at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Murfreesboro, Arkansas, the odds are higher than usual. \"Are you going to bless me and let me find a diamond today?\" That was Susie Clark's prayer on April 23, according to the state park service. Soon after, Clark, who is from Evening Shade, Arkansas, saw a 3.69-carat white, teardrop-shaped diamond in the plowed field. Inspired by her prayer, Clark named it the Hallelujah Diamond. She plans to keep it. The diamond, which is the largest found at the park so far this year, is about the size of a pinto bean, says park interpreter Waymon Cox. \"And it's the largest one found since April 16, 2014, when a 6.19-carat white diamond, named the Limitless Diamond, was found at the park,\" he said, according to a park press release. It's the 122nd diamond found at Crater of Diamonds this year. Visitors get to keep what they find at the state park's 37.5-acre search field, which is named for an ancient eruption that scattered the area with gems. The area, which became a state park in 1972, is the only public site in the world where -- for a small fee -- anyone can dig for diamonds and keep them. It's not clear how much the diamond is worth, and park officials aren't trained to appraise them, according to the park website. But Oklahoman Tara Clymer sold a 3.85-carat diamond she found at the park last year for $20,000. 50 states, 50 spots: Natural wonders. Park staff regularly plow the area to bring more diamonds to the surface for visitors to discover. The 40.23-carat Uncle Sam, the nation's largest diamond, was found in 1924, and the \"perfect\" 3.03-carat Strawn-Wagner diamond was found in 1990. The Strawn-Wagner Diamond was cut in 1997 by the renowned diamond firm Lazare Kaplan International of New York. The now 1.09-carat diamond is on display at the park visitor center. The park stretches for more than 900 acres along the Little Missouri River, but the diamond field is the main attraction. More than 75,000 diamonds have been discovered there since farmer John Huddleston discovered gems on what was then his property in 1906.\n\noutput:",

Lewis Hamilton took victory for the Silver Arrows at the Chinese Grand Prix -- only for his teammate Nico Rosberg to later claim he had ruined his race by driving slowly. The reigning world champion captured his 35th grand prix win with a peerless pole-to-flag win under Shanghai's sunny skies. \"It was great to have a smooth weekend,\" the British racer said before spraying the champagne on the podium. \"The team have done a fantastic job to up our pace and improve after our last race where we struggled a bit.\" F1 championship standings. Hamilton had lost the Malaysia Grand Prix in a strategic battle with the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel but it was business as usual in Shanghai. Rosberg came home second for Mercedes to snuff out the threat from the chasing Italian racers and renew his rivalry with Hamilton. \"It was an important comeback for the team,\" said the 2014 championship runner-up. Ferrari continued to put pressure on the world champion team with Vettel finishing third to collect his third straight podium of 2015. \"We just wanted to bring the podium back home,\" said Vettel, a four-time world champion with Red Bull Racing. \"It's been three out of three so far so it feels pretty good. I feel happy in the team and hopefully we can get a little bit closer to challenge these guys.\" Vettel is just 13 points behind Hamilton in the world championship and four points ahead of Rosberg, after the first three races of the year. Rosberg unhappy. It was a disheartening weekend for Rosberg -- the son of 1982 world champion Keke -- and he allowed his frustrations to spill over for the first time this season. On Saturday, Hamilton beat him to pole position by just 0.042 seconds and Rosberg complained to his engineers on the pit to car radio: \"Oh, come on guys!\" Then the German insisted his race was hampered when he found himself sandwiched between race leader Hamilton and Vettel, both of whom had stopped for fresh tyres a few laps earlier. \"Lewis is driving very slowly. Tell him to speed up,\" Rosberg told the Mercedes pit wall. Mercedes then instructed Hamilton on the team radio: \"OK Lewis we'd like to pick the pace up a little bit.\" Rosberg complained after the race that Hamilton's lackadaisical Sunday driving was holding him up, pushing him back into Vettel's thrall and taking life out of his tyres. \"It's interesting to hear from you Lewis about your pace up front,\" Rosberg said in the post-race media conference. \"That was compromising my race. Driving slowly, that was unnecessary, and meant Sebastian was closer to me. \"It cost me a lot of time ... I'm unhappy about that of course.\" Hamilton responded: \"It's not my job to look after Nico's race. It's my job to bring the car home. \"I didn't do anything intentionally to slow the cars down. If Nico had wanted to get by he could have tried, but he didn't.\" Bahrain. Hamilton has won two grands prix in 2015 while Rosberg has yet to climb onto the top step of the podium. If the German is to repeat his thrilling 2014 world title challenge, which went down to the final race in Abu Dhabi, he will need to turn things around soon. Rosberg has the chance to exorcise his frustrations on track at the Bahrain Grand Prix in just seven day's time. Ferrari will hope the hot track temperatures at the desert race will help them topple Mercedes again, as they did on Sepang's sizzling circuit. The Italian team have the horsepower. Vettel finished less than three seconds behind Hamilton in China with Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen fourth. There was also a small feat further down the field as former Ferrari race winner Fernando Alonso finished his first race for the McLaren Honda partnership with 12th place in China.

In an interview with The Daily Beast, the 62-year-old comic talked about her struggle with macular degeneration and glaucoma — two eye diseases that get progressively worse over time and can steal vision. Barr's doctors haven't provided a timeline, but her symptoms are worsening: \"My vision is closing in now,\" she said. \"I just try and enjoy vision as much as possible. Y'know, living it up.\" Related: 9 worst eye care mistakes you're making. Macular degeneration is a breakdown of the part of the retina that allows us to see fine details in the center of vision; while glaucoma damages the nerve that connects the retina to the brain, and is often caused by fluid build-up and pressure in the eyes. (Barr said in the interview that she helps relieve the pressure by using marijuana, which is known to temporarily lower pressure inside the eye.) \"It's somewhat unusual that Roseanne Bar has both, but not unheard of,\" explains ophthalmologist Steven A. Shanbom, MD, of Shanbom Eye Specialists in Berkley, Mich. Though there are some controllable risk factors, certain people are genetically predisposed to these diseases, so Barr may simply be prone to both. \"Certainly it's sad. The combination of the two is terrible. Macular degeneration takes away her central vision, and glaucoma is taking away her peripheral vision,\" Dr. Shanbom adds. (He is not treating Roseanne Barr, and does not know the specifics of her case.) The risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60, with some people, especially African Americans, at higher risk in their 40s. That's why the American Academy of Opthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4-0, even if you have perfect vision. In the early stages, you can have either condition, but have no symptoms at all. Things like a family history or high blood pressure, or issues within the eye (like having a thinner cornea, for example) might lead your MD to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half. Related: 10 natural ways to lower blood pressure. There is no cure for either disease. But like those eyedrops, there are treatments that may delay the progression of early-stage glaucoma (from other drugs to surgery), and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration (including an implantable telescope). The future looks brighter however: An animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early-stage macular degeneration. There are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases. Here, five ways to protect your peepers. Slip on your shades—even when it's cloudy. Sun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration, as well as cataracts (clouding of the lenses). Make sure your sunglasses offer 99% to 100% UV protection. Sporting a pair that doesn't filter UV light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all, because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays. Schedule in a regular walk. Studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma, and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, all you need to do is raise your pulse 20% to 25% (which could mean a brisk walk) for 20 minutes, a minimum of four times a week. Related: 9 tweaks that make walking workouts more effective. Eat your greens. Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin—antioxidants that lower your risk of developing macular degeneration (and cataracts too), research shows. Another good source: egg yolks. Snack on almonds, citrus, and berries. Almonds are loaded with vitamin E (a handful provides about half your daily dose), which slows macular degeneration; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin C, which cuts your odds of developing the disease. Avoid cigarette smoke. While smoking is bad news for many parts of your body, you may not have considered eyes to be one of them. However, smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration. Avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart, it can protect your peepers too.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "Roseanne Barr, a 62-year-old comedian, revealed this week that she is dealing with macular degeneration and glaucoma, two eye diseases that can lead to vision loss. Macular degeneration affects the retina's ability to see fine details, while glaucoma damages the nerve connecting the retina to the brain due to fluid build-up and pressure in the eyes. Barr's doctors haven't provided a timeline, but her symptoms are worsening. Both diseases are more common after age 60, and certain people, especially African Americans, are at higher risk in their 40s. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam at age 40. There is no cure for either disease, but treatments can delay their progression. Preventative measures include wearing sunglasses with UV protection, engaging in regular aerobic exercise, eating leafy greens, and avoiding cigarette smoke.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nKabul, Afghanistan (CNN)It is an unimaginably hideous outcome. To be raped by your cousin's husband; be jailed for adultery as your attacker was married; to suffer the ignominy of global uproar about your jailing and assault, but be pardoned by presidential decree; and then to endure the shame and rejection from a conservative society that somehow held you to blame. The solution in this society? Marry your attacker. That's what happened to Gulnaz, who was barely 16 when she was raped. She's now carrying the third child of her attacker, Asadullah, who was convicted and jailed -- though this was then reduced. Gulnaz's plight -- like so much in beleaguered Afghanistan -- disappeared from the world's gaze once she was pardoned and released courtesy of a presidential pardon. Instead of a new start, what followed for Gulnaz was a quiet, Afghan solution to the \"problem\" -- a telling sign of where women's rights stand in Afghanistan despite the billions that have poured into this country from the U.S. government and its NATO allies during more than a decade of war. We found Gulnaz in her family home. Smile, the name of the daughter born of the rape, is now a shining little girl, bouncing around the house that her mother shares with Asadullah's first wife -- who is also Gulnaz's cousin. Asadullah agreed to let us speak with him and Gulnaz because, it seemed, he wanted to show us that things were now settled, that under Afghanistan's version of social morality he had done the right thing. He had rescued Gulnaz from shame. \"If I hadn't married her, (but) according to our traditions, she couldn't have lived back in society,\" he tells us. \"Her brothers didn't want to accept her back. Now, she doesn't have any of those problems.\" 2011: Thousands sign petition for Gulaz release. Gulnaz remains subdued throughout our meeting and does not once look her husband in the eye. \"I didn't want to ruin the life of my daughter or leave myself helpless so I agreed to marry him,\" she says. \"We are traditional people. When we get a bad name, we prefer death to living with that name in society.\" As Smile attempts to pour tea, the other seven children in this household run around the courtyard. The first wife remains unseen in the house. A portrait of Gulnaz's liberator in 2011, the then-president Hamid Karzai, hangs on the wall. But the sense of order here is undermined by the fact that this is a house built around a crime. How Gulnaz ended up here requires some explanation. There was pressure upon her to marry her attacker after her release. But at the same time, other activists were trying to assist her with an asylum bid abroad. \"Unfortunately, Gulnaz was heavily pressured to marry her attacker by various people within the government which, in and of itself, was immensely disappointing,\" her former attorney, an American citizen named Kimberley Motley, tells us. \"Gulnaz was constantly told that neither she nor her daughter would be protected if she did not succumb to their pressure to marry...  Gulnaz essentially became a prisoner of her environment. \"As an uneducated, young, single mother with no family support, it would have been an uphill battle for Gulnaz and her daughter.\" Local pressure won out. She was introduced to her attacker in the shelter where CNN first interviewed her upon release from prison. They talked and it was agreed she would marry him. Most disturbingly, the woman who -- despite knowing the stigma it would create around her -- defiantly insisted she had been raped when we spoke nearly four years ago, now says she was told by her relatives to make up the allegations. \"Now she is beside me and knows that it was not as big as they had shown it,\" says Asadullah. \"No I am not thinking about it anymore,\" Gulnaz adds. \"I don't have a problem with him now and I don't want to think about the past problems. My life is OK... I am happy with my life... It is going on.\" She is then permitted to talk with us alone. Asadullah moves away but stands close to the door of the room. Though she now maintains she was not raped, she explains her decision. She contradicts her husband, saying her brothers would have taken her back, had she not married him. \"My brothers opposed the marriage and told me to take my daughter and go to Pakistan to live with them instead,\" she says. \"But now we're married, they disowned me and won't see me again.\" Her decision was for her daughter. \"No, I couldn't fulfill my wishes in life. I married this man; I cut relations with my family only to buy my daughter's future.\" It is truly chilling to see how things have gone for Gulnaz after the level of international attention her story received -- pregnant with the third child of the man who was once her rapist, accepting a life as his second wife, trapped in his home.\n\noutput:",

Because of that, one's response to such imagery often becomes calloused or desensitized. This concept of \"how we digest images of war through mainstream media outlets,\" was what drove photographer Simon Brann Thorpe to begin his project \"Toy Soldiers.\" This idea to create a fresh perspective drove him into the desert of Western Sahara, a long-disputed region of northwestern Africa. Thorpe uses the area's harsh landscape as a powerful backdrop for soldiers posed as green plastic figurines -- similar to the popular toys that many children play with. The soldiers are with the Polisario Front, an independence movement that has been clashing with Morocco over the region since the mid-1970s. Thorpe said his project enables \"the creation of a visual metaphor from which a viewer develops their own emotional, physical and political response to war and conflict, when faced with the realization that the images do not contain toy soldiers but real soldiers.\" Thorpe's background was not in photojournalism, but in landscape photography, which lends to his powerful placement of the soldiers in the desert -- not to mention that all the locations chosen are historic locations of battles between Morocco and the Polisario Front. \"The conflict in Western Sahara receives virtually zero coverage despite 2015 being the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of war there,\" Thorpe said. After a ceasefire in 1991, the people of Western Sahara have been living in a state of non-resolution. The people are split into two camps -- those living in Moroccan-occupied territory, and those in refugee camps in Algeria. Social media. Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Thorpe had to get clearance to work with the Polisario Front military and also had to be cautious of how many troops he moved about at one time -- otherwise he would have needed permission from the United Nations. He usually worked with about 50 or 60 soldiers at a time. The autumn months did not offer much reprieve from the long hours in the sweltering desert sun. Thorpe would work with the troops' commander to position the men, then climb atop sandy mountains with his wide-angle lens and capture these striking images. They would work till dusk and then spend the night under the stars. Not only were the soldiers willing participants for this project, but they also helped construct the platforms they stood on. Thorpe said they were made out of old oil drums. After the elaborate five-week production, Thorpe hopes his images will raise questions on \"how images of war (will) be consumed in the future with ever-diminishing attention spans and competition for them.\" Simon Brann Thorpe's \"Toy Soldiers\" book is available for pre-order through Dewi Lewis Publishing.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nJames Holmes made his introduction to the world in a Colorado cinema filled with spectators watching a midnight showing of the new Batman movie, \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" in June 2012. The moment became one of the deadliest shootings in U.S. history. Holmes is accused of opening fire on the crowd, killing 12 people and injuring or maiming 70 others in Aurora, a suburb of Denver. Holmes appeared like a comic book character: He resembled the Joker, with red-orange hair, similar to the late actor Heath Ledger's portrayal of the villain in an earlier Batman movie, authorities said. But Holmes was hardly a cartoon. Authorities said he wore body armor and carried several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, with lots of ammo. He also wore a gas mask. Holmes says he was insane at the time of the shootings, and that is his legal defense and court plea: not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors aren't swayed and will seek the death penalty. Opening statements in his trial are scheduled to begin Monday. Holmes admits to the shootings but says he was suffering \"a psychotic episode\" at the time,  according to court papers filed in July 2013 by the state public defenders, Daniel King and Tamara A. Brady. Evidence \"revealed thus far in the case supports the defense's position that Mr. Holmes suffers from a severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed the acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained by moviegoers on July 20, 2012,\" the public defenders wrote. Holmes no longer looks like a dazed Joker, as he did in his first appearance before a judge in 2012. He appeared dramatically different in January when jury selection began for his trial: 9,000 potential jurors were summoned for duty, described as one of the nation's largest jury calls. Holmes now has a cleaner look, with a mustache, button-down shirt and khaki pants. In January, he had a beard and eyeglasses. If this new image sounds like one of an academician, it may be because Holmes, now 27, once was one. Just before the shooting, Holmes was a doctoral student in neuroscience, and he was studying how the brain works, with his schooling funded by a U.S. government grant. Yet for all his learning, Holmes apparently lacked the capacity to command his own mind, according to the case against him. A jury will ultimately decide Holmes' fate. That panel is made up of 12 jurors and 12 alternates. They are 19 women and five men, and almost all are white and middle-aged. The trial could last until autumn. When jury summonses were issued in January, each potential juror stood a 0.2% chance of being selected, District Attorney George Brauchler told the final jury this month. He described the approaching trial as \"four to five months of a horrible roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine.\" The jury will have to render verdicts on each of the 165 counts against Holmes, including murder and attempted murder charges. Meanwhile, victims and their relatives are challenging all media outlets \"to stop the gratuitous use of the name and likeness of mass killers, thereby depriving violent individuals the media celebrity and media spotlight they so crave,\" the No Notoriety group says. They are joined by victims from eight other mass shootings in recent U.S. history. Raised in central coastal California and in San Diego, James Eagan Holmes is the son of a mathematician father noted for his work at the FICO firm that provides credit scores and a registered nurse mother, according to the U-T San Diego newspaper. Holmes also has a sister, Chris, a musician, who's five years younger, the newspaper said. His childhood classmates remember him as a clean-cut, bespectacled boy with an \"exemplary\" character who \"never gave any trouble, and never got in trouble himself,\" The Salinas Californian reported. His family then moved down the California coast, where Holmes grew up in the San Diego-area neighborhood of Rancho Peñasquitos, which a neighbor described as \"kind of like Mayberry,\" the San Diego newspaper said. Holmes attended Westview High School, which says its school district sits in \"a primarily middle- to upper-middle-income residential community.\" There, Holmes ran cross-country, played soccer and later worked at a biotechnology internship at the Salk Institute and Miramar College, which attracts academically talented students. By then, his peers described him as standoffish and a bit of a wiseacre, the San Diego newspaper said. Holmes attended college fairly close to home, in a neighboring area known as Southern California's \"inland empire\" because it's more than an hour's drive from the coast, in a warm, low-desert climate. He entered the University of California, Riverside, in 2006 as a scholarship student. In 2008 he was a summer camp counselor for disadvantaged children, age 7 to 14, at Camp Max Straus, run by Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles. He graduated from UC Riverside in 2010 with the highest honors and a bachelor's degree in neuroscience. \"Academically, he was at the top of the top,\" Chancellor Timothy P. White said. He seemed destined for even higher achievement. By 2011, he had enrolled as a doctoral student in the neuroscience program at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, the largest academic health center in the Rocky Mountain region. The doctoral in neuroscience program attended by Holmes focuses on how the brain works, with an emphasis on processing of information, behavior, learning and memory. Holmes was one of six pre-thesis Ph.D. students in the program who were awarded a neuroscience training grant from the National Institutes of Health. The grant rewards outstanding neuroscientists who will make major contributions to neurobiology. A syllabus that listed Holmes as a student at the medical school shows he was to have delivered a presentation about microRNA biomarkers. But Holmes struggled, and his own mental health took an ominous turn. In March 2012, he told a classmate he wanted to kill people, and that he would do so \"when his life was over,\" court documents said. Holmes was \"denied access to the school after June 12, 2012, after he made threats to a professor,\" according to court documents. About that time, Holmes was a patient of University of Colorado psychiatrist Lynne Fenton. Fenton was so concerned about Holmes' behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues, saying he could be a danger to others, CNN affiliate KMGH-TV reported, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation. Fenton's concerns surfaced in early June, sources told the Denver station. Holmes began to fantasize about killing \"a lot of people\" in early June, nearly six weeks before the shootings, the station reported, citing unidentified sources familiar with the investigation. Holmes' psychiatrist contacted several members of a \"behavioral evaluation and threat assessment\" team to say Holmes could be a danger to others, the station reported. At issue was whether to order Holmes held for 72 hours to be evaluated by mental health professionals, the station reported. \"Fenton made initial phone calls about engaging the BETA team\" in \"the first 10 days\" of June, but it \"never came together\" because in the period Fenton was having conversations with team members, Holmes began the process of dropping out of school, a source told KMGH. Defense attorneys have rejected the prosecution's assertions that Holmes was barred from campus. Citing statements from the university, Holmes' attorneys have argued that his access was revoked because that's normal procedure when a student drops enrollment. What caused this turn for the worse for Holmes has yet to be clearly detailed. In the months before the shooting, he bought four weapons and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition, authorities said. Police said he also booby-trapped his third-floor apartment with explosives, but police weren't fooled. After Holmes was caught in the cinema parking lot immediately after the shooting, bomb technicians went to the apartment and neutralized the explosives. No one was injured at the apartment building. Nine minutes before Holmes went into the movie theater, he called a University of Colorado switchboard, public defender Brady has said in court. The number he called can be used to get in contact with faculty members during off hours, Brady said. Court documents have also revealed that investigators have obtained text messages that Holmes exchanged with someone before the shooting. That person was not named, and the content of the texts has not been made public. According to The New York Times, Holmes sent a text message to a fellow graduate student, a woman, about two weeks before the shooting. She asked if he had left Aurora yet, reported the newspaper, which didn't identify her. No, he had two months left on his lease, Holmes wrote back, according to the Times. He asked if she had heard of \"dysphoric mania,\" a form of bipolar disorder marked by the highs of mania and the dark and sometimes paranoid delusions of major depression. The woman asked if the disorder could be managed with treatment. \"It was,\" Holmes wrote her, according to the Times. But he warned she should stay away from him \"because I am bad news,\" the newspaper reported. It was her last contact with Holmes. After the shooting, Holmes' family issued a brief statement: \"Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved,\" they said, without giving any information about their son. Since then, prosecutors have refused to offer a plea deal to Holmes. For Holmes, \"justice is death,\" said Brauchler, the district attorney. In December, Holmes' parents, who will be attending the trial, issued another statement: They asked that their son's life be spared and that he be sent to an institution for mentally ill people for the rest of his life, if he's found not guilty by reason of insanity. \"He is not a monster,\" Robert and Arlene Holmes wrote, saying the death penalty is \"morally wrong, especially when the condemned is mentally ill.\" \"He is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness,\" the parents said. The matter will be settled by the jury. CNN's Ana Cabrera and Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report from Denver.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nOn Thursday, President Barack Obama revealed that a U.S. drone strike had killed Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto, two aid workers held hostage on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Al Qaeda had sought to trade the two for prisoners held by the United States and an end to drone strikes. But it is not only terrorist groups that try to reap reward from the taking of hostages -- take the case of Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief. On April 20, just two days before diplomats resumed talks in Vienna, Austria, to reach a final agreement over Iran's nuclear program, Rezaian's Iranian attorney announced that his client had been charged with espionage, conducting propaganda, collaborating with foreign governments and collecting information \"with malicious intent.\" The State Department, Rezaian's employers at The Washington Post and fellow journalists reacted with outrage. Their anger is justified, but the decision should surprise no one: There is a long history of rogue regimes seizing hostages against the backdrop of diplomacy to extract concessions, humiliate the United States or signal unease. The scale of Iran's current hostage-taking -- not only Rezaian but also Iranian-Americans Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati -- may pale in comparison with Iranian behavior of decades past. But the use of hostages to extract concessions or dampen the enthusiasm surrounding reconciliation is part of a consistent pattern. Consider the original Iran hostage seizure: On November 4, 1979, radical students seized the American Embassy in Tehran, ultimately holding 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days. Often forgotten was what sparked that episode, which occurred more than nine months after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini declared the Islamic revolution victorious. The problem was a rush to reconcile: At a November 1, 1979, Algiers reception, Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, met Iranian Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan. According to Brzezinski's own memoir, he told Bazargan that the United States was open to any relationship the Islamic republic wanted. Photos of their handshake graced newspapers around the world. Iranian hardliners, meanwhile, were apoplectic that Barzagan was \"betraying\" Iran's revolutionary principles, and seized the embassy to block any rapprochement. Khomeini endorsed their action. \"Our young people must foil these plots,\" he reportedly said. The hostages became pawns in an escalating series of demands. Brzezinski's dream of reconciliation became a nightmare. Iran released the embassy hostages as Ronald Reagan took his oath of office, ending its first but not last hostage-taking episode. Iranian proxies seized a number of Americans in Lebanon. Reagan blessed a plan to trade arms for hostages. Putting aside the illegalities of diverting weaponry to the Nicaraguan Contras, the genesis of the scheme was not only a desire for diplomacy but also, much as with Obama's outreach today, to solidify the moderate camp within the Iranian political spectrum. Initially, the scheme worked, but no sooner had American officials delivered the last load of military equipment and the last hostages set free, then kidnappers seized three more Americans. Hostage-taking had simply become another way to collect concessions. Of course, Iran is not alone in such games. Whenever the United States tries to use diplomacy to bring rogue regimes in from the cold, it faces hostage crises. Take North Korea: Obama campaigned as the anti-Bush on the world stage. \"The notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them ... is ridiculous,\" Obama, then a senator, declared in July 2007. Obama hadn't even marked two months in office when North Korea detained two journalists working for Al Gore's Current TV. A kangaroo court sentenced Laura Ling and Euna Lee to 12 years in prison. It was traditional hostage diplomacy. Former President Bill Clinton traveled to Pyongyang to appeal for their release. North Korean leader Kim Jong Il used the episode to solidify the position of his third son and designated successor, Kim Jong Un. North Korea's police force put out word that \"General Kim Jong Un's artifice let former U.S. President Clinton cross the Pacific to apologize to the Great Leader. It was all made possible thanks to General Kim Jong Un's extraordinary prophecy and outstanding tactics.\" North Korea's deputy foreign minister confided that the groundwork for the episode had been planned long in advance. Ling and Lee were neither the first nor the last Americans that North Korea seized during the Obama era. After North Korea torpedoed a South Korean ship, killing 46, Obama sought North Korea's censure in the U.N. Security Council. Pyongyang responded by threatening Aijalon Mahli Gomes, an American imprisoned earlier that year for illegally entering North Korea. On cue, former President Jimmy Carter arrived to mediate for Gomes' release, called for new talks and, by omission, derailed efforts to hold North Korea accountable for its killing of nearly four dozen South Korean sailors. The pattern would repeat in 2012 when North Korea seized Kenneth Bae, an American whom Kim Jong Un sought to leverage into concessions. The following year, North Korea arrested an 85-year-old Korean War veteran touring the hermit kingdom and, the next year, took two other tourists hostage. Each arrest resulted in a high-level visit, an apology to North Korea that bolstered the dear leader's claims of strength and renewed engagement. Saddam Hussein likewise worked from the same playbook. In March 1995, Iraqi security forces seized two American defense contractors who strayed into Iraq from Kuwait. Sentenced to eight years, they served 114 days before Rep. Bill Richardson, D-New Mexico, a close Clinton ally (and future Cabinet-level U.N. ambassador) flew to Baghdad to retrieve them. The American media lauded Richardson, but his trip was not without cost: Saddam used it to depict Iraq as strong and America as weak. \"President Saddam Hussein ... accepts the pleas by Bill Clinton, the Congress and American people,\" the Iraqi News Agency reported. And so did the Taliban. Fifteen years before Obama traded alleged American deserter Bowe Bergdahl for five high-value Taliban and alleged al Qaeda operatives imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, the Taliban arrested two Americans female missionaries. Their detention -- and threatened death sentence -- came against the backdrop of Clinton-era attempts to negotiate with and perhaps even normalize relations with the Taliban; the Taliban, too, knew how holding Americans captive could even the playing field or even represent leverage for new concessions. So what does Iran's hostage brinkmanship portend? Diplomats drink their own Kool-Aid, and convince themselves that their engagement can bring rogues in from the cold. Ego, ambition and arrogance convince presidents that the failure of past diplomacy rests with their predecessors rather than adversaries. Hostages such as Rezaian are canaries in the coal mine, however. Their captivity -- not suave officials and their smooth promises -- show both the true character of the regime and its disregard for the norms of diplomacy.\n\noutput:",

Al Qaeda had attempted to trade the men for prisoners and an end to drone strikes. However, hostage-taking is not limited to terrorist groups. The case of Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief, illustrates this point. On April 20, just before diplomats resumed talks in Vienna, Austria, over Iran's nuclear program, Rezaian was charged with espionage and other crimes by Iranian authorities. Rezaian's arrest, along with those of other Iranian-Americans, Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati, is part of a long-standing pattern of rogue regimes using hostages to extract concessions, humiliate the United States, or signal unease. This tactic dates back to the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, when students seized the American Embassy in Tehran and held diplomats hostage for 444 days. The decision to charge Rezaian should not come as a surprise, as similar incidents have occurred throughout history. For instance, North Korea detained two American journalists in 2009, and former President Bill Clinton intervened to secure their release",

Machete-wielding attackers hacking immigrants to death in major cities in South Africa. As attacks against foreigners and their businesses rage on, killing at least six people this week, other nations in the continent are scrambling to evacuate their citizens from South Africa.  But this is not the first time xenophobic violence has exploded in a country that  tries to portray itself as a diverse \"rainbow\" nation. They started after Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini said at a recent gathering that foreigners \"should pack their bags and go\" because they are taking jobs from citizens, local media reported. Shortly after his comments, violence against immigrants erupted in the port city of Durban. His office has denied he made the comments, saying  journalists misquoted him. While kings are mostly ceremonial figures in the nation, they are influential in their communities. But the United Nations said the attacks started in March after a labor dispute between citizens and foreign workers. Some citizens have accused African immigrants of taking their already scarce jobs, undermining businesses owned by locals and contributing to a high crime rate.  The nation's unemployment rate is about 25%, according to government figures. But resentment over porous borders, growing crime rates, poverty and corruption are also a major concern, analysts say. President Jacob Zuma has said his government is addressing the social and economic concerns. But he said immigrants contribute to the nation's economy and bring skills that are in demand, and should not be stereotyped as criminals. \"While some foreign nationals have been arrested for various crimes, it is misleading and wrong to label or regard all foreign nationals as being involved in crime in the country,\" Zuma said. The nation has about 2 million documented and undocumented immigrants, which is about 4% of the total population, according to a study by the University of the Witwatersrand. Zimbabweans make  up the largest  group of immigrants. Also, South Africa is a top travel destination for wealthy Africans because of its proximity and developed infrastructure. Yes. This is the latest in a series of attacks that date back years. In January, looters burned businesses owned by foreigners in another wave of xenophobic attacks. In addition, there were other incidents of violence last year, Human Rights Watch said. Seven years ago, Johannesburg was the epicenter of more anti-immigrant tensions that left dozens dead in attacks that later spread to Cape Town. Most of the victims were Zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances. In those attacks, police arrested more than 200 people on various charges, including rape, murder, robbery and theft. In 2006, xenophobic violence broke out again for several months in Cape Town. Victims of xenophobic attacks have been from various African nations, including Nigeria, Somalia and Ethiopia. African nations have condemned the attacks. Kenya, Malawi and Zimbabwe are just a few of the countries evacuating their citizens from South Africa. In Zambia, local radio station QFM said it will not play South African music in solidarity with the victims. And in Mozambique, South African energy and chemical giant Sasol sent about 340 South African nationals home. The company said Mozambican employees voiced concern about reported violence against their nationals and protested the presence of South African employees in Mozambique. Most of the attacks have erupted in poor and marginalized areas. Despite the progress the nation has made since its apartheid days, inequality still remains a major concern, according to the Nelson Mandela Foundation. \"It is up to the present and next generations to take up the cudgels where you (Mandela) have left off. It is up to them, through service to deepen our democracy; entrench and defend our constitution; eradicate poverty; eliminate inequality; fight corruption, and serve always with compassion, respect, integrity and tolerance,\" the foundation said in a statement. \"Xenophobia, racism and sexism must be fought with tenacity, wisdom and enlightenment.\" As fears of more attacks grow, South Africans have taken to social media and the streets to protest xenophobia and violence.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nWashington (CNN)Judge Jeffrey Sutton doesn't have a lot of company on the appeals courts these days. Sutton, who sits on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, penned the only recent appellate court decision to uphold state bans on same-sex marriage. His opinion, issued in November, goes up against an avalanche of judicial rulings striking down such bans. The split helped pave the way for the U.S. Supreme Court to take up a case on Tuesday that could ultimately decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have a constitutional right to marry. And it provides important insight into the legal arguments that could be made before the court by states seeking to uphold bans at a time when the national sentiment is quickly shifting in favor of same-sex marriage. \"It's an ideal piece of judicial craftsmanship,\" said Ryan T. Anderson of the Heritage Foundation, who believes that state bans on same-sex marriage are constitutional. Sutton \"more or less takes each and every argument that the other side has made, and then one by one by one, he explains why it doesn't work.\" Critics call the opinion an outlier and don't believe it will carry much weight, considering the number of courts that have overturned same-sex marriage bans in the nearly two years since the Supreme Court struck down the core of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. \"Judge Sutton's opinion stands alone,\" said Jon W. Davidson, legal director of Lambda Legal, a gay rights advocacy group. Sutton, 54, is the former state solicitor for Ohio, where he handled appeals for the state's attorney general. He clerked for Justices Antonin Scalia and Lewis Powell -- Scalia once called Sutton \"one of the very best law clerks I ever had.\" Appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, Sutton is considered a conservative jurist with a keen interest in states' rights. Here are the central arguments from his opinion that states seeking to uphold their same-sex marriage bans are expected to echo on Tuesday. It is \"dangerous and demeaning,\" Sutton wrote, to the citizenry to assume that only judges \"can fairly understand\" the arguments for and against same-sex marriage. \"Isn't the goal to create a culture in which a majority of citizens dignify and respect the rights of minority groups?\" he asked in the opinion joined by Judge Deborah L. Cook, also a Bush appointee. Critics such as Davidson have roundly condemned such reasoning. \"The people don't get to decide what the Constitution safeguards,\" Davidson said. \"They don't get to vote to violate the Constitution.\" Sutton pointed  to the drafters and their views of the 14th Amendment. \"Nobody in this case,\" he wrote, \"argues that the people who adopted the Fourteenth Amendment understood it to require the States to change the definition of marriage.\" It's an argument made to enforce the idea that there is no fundamental right to marriage for same-sex couples in the Constitution. \"From the founding of the Republic to 2003, every state defined marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman,\" he wrote, noting that the \"Fourteenth Amendment permits, though does not require, States to define marriage that way.\" He said that the same-sex marriage bans rationally advance a legitimate government policy. \"By creating a status (marriage) and by subsidizing it (e.g. with tax-filing privileges and deductions), the States created an incentive for two people who procreate together to stay together for purposes of rearing offspring.\" He said that states should not be accused of \"irrationality,\" but only the awareness that same-sex couples don't have children in the same way as couples of the opposite sex. Sutton pushes back on any suggestion that those who oppose same-sex marriage have negative feelings about gay and lesbian couples. He said that ballot initiatives banning same sex-marriage were not driven by hostility but were passed by \"real people who teach our children, create our jobs, and defend our shores.\" Gene Schaerr, a Washington appellate lawyer who help to defend Utah's ban on same-sex marriage, calls Sutton's opinion a road map for whoever might write an opinion supporting state bans. \"He's very much willing both in the result and in his analysis to leave the issue to the people without suggesting an answer one way or another,\" Schaerr said. But attached to Sutton's opinion was a harsh dissent from a third member of the three-judge panel that heard the case in the 6th Circuit. Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey, a Bill Clinton appointee, dismissed the opinion as an \"engrossing TED talk\" and a \"largely irrelevant discourse on democracy and federalism.\" Daughtrey said that Sutton failed to see the plaintiffs as individuals \"suffering actual harm.\" \"These plaintiffs are not political zealots trying to push reform on their fellow citizens, \" she wrote, but committed same-sex couples seeking equal status. Her harshest language was for Sutton's premise that the decision should be left to the democratic process. \"If we in the judiciary do not have the authority, and indeed the responsibility, to right fundamental wrongs left excused by a majority of the electorate, our whole intricate, constitutional system of checks and balances, as well as the oaths to which we swore, prove to be nothing but shams.\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nTuesday, April 14, is Equal Pay Day. Here's the announcement presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should make:. \"Today in America, women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn.  And the gap is even greater for women of color. That's unconscionable.  As president, my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100% of the population is paid 100% of what they're worth.  And so, I'm announcing that if elected president, I will take a 23% pay cut, equivalent to the current gender wage gap, to stand in solidarity with working women in America. And I won't take a raise until every woman in America gets a raise, too.\" April 14 wasn't just chosen at random as Equal Pay Day. It's based on a calculation: For women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014, they'd have to work until April 14, 2015. A woman on average loses $431,000 in pay over the course of a 40-year career. Merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty.  And at a time where Republicans are still, bizarrely, trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy, closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights. So here's the perfect opportunity for Hillary Clinton to put her money where her mouth is, literally. In her campaign launch and personal rebrand, Clinton is clearly trying to portray herself as a woman of the people, a populist fighter for the middle class. \"Everyday Americans need a champion,\" Clinton said in her campaign launch video, \"and I want to be that champion.\" Clinton has deftly put her finger in the wind and sensed the winds of populism blowing through America. Indeed, the fact that many Democratic voters still clamor for a less pro-war, less pro-Wall Street, more Elizabeth Warren-like alternative to Clinton is an ever-present thorn in the otherwise blooming garden of Clinton's inevitability. Opinion: The myth of Equal Pay Day. With her video, Clinton has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism. But can a wealthy white woman who once sat on the board of Walmart, has already lived in the White House, collects six-figure speaking fees and doesn't seem to own a pair of jeans really inhabit the portrait of a populist fighter? This is where a good ol'-fashioned political stunt would come in handy.  And make no mistake about it, I'm recommending a political stunt. Let's call a spade a spade. Hillary Clinton is a very rich person. While she's certainly not the first rich person to run for president, her wealth -- and the related perception of being out of touch with ordinary Americans -- is an obstacle in her candidacy. The difference between the current standard presidential salary of $400,000 a year and the 77 cents-on-the-dollar version of that salary, or $308,000, is probably a drop in the bucket in Clinton's bank account at this point. And yet the symbolic power is profound. Because what Clinton would be reminding us is that across America, the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23% less than the aggregate salaries of all men. 78 cents on the dollar: The facts about the gender wage gap. Thanks to the hacked Sony emails, we saw that even top female stars and executives in Hollywood are paid less than their male counterparts. What more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary? Clinton wouldn't just be saying she stands with the working women of America, she'd be showing it. Is it offensive to suggest that the first female commander in chief should be paid 23% less than her male predecessors for doing exactly the same work?  Yes. And that's the point -- to use her status to highlight the offensive gender wage gap and what Clinton, as president, would do to fix it. Yes, such stunts are trite and theatrical.  They're also effective, especially in our increasingly short-attention-span, it-only-happened-if-you-can-tweet it, symbolism-over-substance culture. Politics used to be about clunky people (mostly men) debating complex policies. Now it's about polished memes and even more polished candidates. Policy (I hope) still matters, but we're as likely to debate a candidate's \"image\" as her or his \"substance.\" The truth is that stunts and theatrics are now part and parcel of politics, as they are in our culture in general. That doesn't mean they can't also serve a noble purpose, in highlighting important problems and inspiring solutions. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest. Clinton did an arguably brilliant thing in her campaign launch, framing her video and presidential bid as not about her but the American people. In fact, Clinton didn't even appear in the video until the very end -- it was all about middle-class Americans, working hard, trying to get by and get ahead. And then we see Hillary, who wants to help. Hillary Clinton can't change who she is, the baggage attached to her by both the right and the left, rightly or wrongly. But she can change what she does going forward, how she shows up and signifies herself as a voice not for the status quo and the establishment -- but for ordinary Americans who need change. If Clinton wins, her presidency will indeed be symbolic and historic. And it will be significant if she does something to change the lives of the 158 million women in America.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "On April 14, 2020, Equal Pay Day marks the point in the year when women's earnings catch up to men's earnings from the previous year. Hillary Clinton, a presidential candidate, proposed taking a 23% pay cut to symbolize the gender wage gap and stand in solidarity with working women. The gender wage gap amounts to an average loss of $431,000 in pay over a 40-year career for women. Closing this gap could lift half of working single mothers out of poverty and stimulate the economy. Clinton's announcement aligns with her campaign's populist stance, aiming to portray herself as a champion for everyday Americans. Critics question her authenticity as a populist fighter due to her wealth and past associations with corporations. Clinton's proposed pay cut, while symbolic, could help highlight the gender wage gap and her commitment to addressing it as president.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 179 words:\nJust before writing this column, I reached into the depths of my wallet, and in between the pilot licenses, I slid out a postage stamp-size certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration. The certificate documents my successful completion of the DC Special Flight Rules Area, or SFRA, online course. The online course verifies that I am knowledgeable to fly a plane under visual flight rules into the most highly restricted U.S. airspace in the country. Although a \"no-fly zone\" over the White House has long existed, the SFRA airspace was developed to protect the Washington area further after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The size of the SFRA airspace is designed to be large enough to give our defense forces enough time to determine if a threat exists from an aircraft entering it, an opportunity to identify the threat, and if necessary, to divert or eliminate it. An airspeed restriction begins at a 60-mile radius from the center of Reagan National Airport. At the 30-mile radius, all aircraft must file a flight plan that identifies itself to air traffic control via a specific four-digit transponder code (a transponder is an electronic communication device that identifies a specific airplane on an air traffic controller's display screen to indicate authorization for the flight). Aircraft must enter the SFRA through specific flight \"gates\" that are displayed on a standard aviation map. Aircraft on instrument flight rule flight plans, which include all airline operations, are not required to comply with SFRA restrictions. Air traffic control assumes the responsibility for the appropriate routing. As a matter of standard procedure, flights using an instrument flight rule flight plan have specific clearances with specific transponder codes, so the authorization for transit through the SFRA airspace is already built into the system. Why do I carry the certificate as an airline pilot? I have had occasion to fly my own little airplane through the airspace on a visual flight rule flight plan. Pilot who landed gyrocopter blogged about why. Noncompliance with the airspace requirements, or worse, no communication at all, carries some serious federal penalties, which could include the suspension or revocation of your pilot license. Being at the wrong end of an F-16 missile is also a possible penalty. So how does a flying machine that looks like a sophisticated lawn chair with helicopter blades invade such highly restricted airspace, as happened Wednesday, when a postal carrier from Florida landed a single-person aircraft on Capitol grounds? Well, I'm making an assumption based on the video footage, but it appears that this aircraft is classified by the FAA as a gyrocopter. A gyrocopter cannot quite launch straight up into the air in the manner of a typical helicopter; it requires a short ground run for takeoff. And most gyrocopters are kit-built aircraft. It also appears that this particular gyrocopter may weigh just under 255 pounds, which classifies it as an ultralight aircraft in FAA parlance. Why is weight significant? Below that weight, a license for the pilot or a license for the aircraft is not required. In addition, to remain in the classification, the maximum designed airspeed can't exceed 55 knots. Lawmaker looking into gyrocopter landing as pilot goes to court. A facility tracking the movement of this particular gyrocopter on radar would witness a speed probably attainable by the average Canadian goose. And the radar reflection on a piece of machinery of that diminutive size is most likely very limited. If it was actually tracked on a radar screen, the target may have appeared to be a flock of birds. How much damage could this aircraft have inflicted had it been intended for nefarious purposes? Well, if it had been crashed into a building, I feel confident that the building would have been triumphant. If the intent had been to carry some sort of destructive device, the weapon would have had to be relatively small. The engine is not designed to carry more than one pilot. And lack of carry-on space is a definite issue. Not that a review of airspace security measures isn't in order, but I wouldn't be concerned that this event will become the next threat epidemic. As an airline pilot, I can say I am relatively confident that our nation's capital is secure from gyrocopter attacks orchestrated by misguided lunatics.\n\noutput:",

Gyrocopters are classified as ultralight aircraft if they weigh under 255 pounds and have a maximum designed airspeed of 55 knots, making them difficult to detect on radar.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nHillary Clinton is now officially a candidate for president -- and the never ending Clinton story rumbles on. She has been a part of all our lives now for approaching a quarter of a century. She started as the first lady that the right loved to hate, then the deceived wife, next a senator, then a candidate for president in one of the most dynamic primaries in history and finally, a secretary of state. The Republicans have their aristocratic Bushes, the Democrats have their Clintons. And if Hillary or Jeb were to win two presidential terms, then in the 44 years from 1981 to 2025, 28 will have had a Clinton or a Bush in the White House. The great American republic now looks about as democratic as \"Game of Thrones.\" But even though Hillary Clinton has been around nearly my entire lifetime, The Economist may speak for many when it asks: \"What does Hillary stand for?\" There is a paradox she presents: She is by far the best-known presidential candidate across both parties and, for the moment, almost unchallenged within her own. Yet even though Diane Feinstein can assert confidently that Hillary \"doesn't 'need' (the White House). But she wants it\" -- the question unanswered is \"What for?\" And for liberals, who believe that government is there to do something, it's this lack of definition that is surely so disconcerting about Clinton. There are good grounds for a liberal primary challenge to Clinton. The economy has revived under Obama but, say critics, largely to the benefit of Wall Street and the super-rich. The riots in Ferguson, Missouri, were a painful reminder that the poor, particularly the nonwhite poor, have been left behind. Clinton's credentials as a fighter against inequality are mixed. It is true, as the Wall Street Times notes, that she has previously called for \"universal prekindergarten, equal pay for women, increases in the minimum wage, paid family leave, higher taxes on the wealthy and an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit for working-poor families.\" But she counts among her friends precisely those corporate people blamed by the Occupy crowd for the country's inequality. Clinton is now, wisely, trying to distance herself from the Clinton Foundation -- after all, its fundraising efforts among foreign interests are hardly the stuff of populist liberalism. Then there is her foreign policy record. Clinton voted in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War (though in her memoir last year, she backed away from the vote, writing that she \"got it wrong.\") As secretary of state, she is easily associated in the mind of the left with such controversies as the war in Syria, the crisis in Libya and the collapse of the Mubarak regime in Egypt. That some of these may have had little to do with her is beside the point. Clinton is going to have to spend a sizeable amount of time during the primaries explaining and defending the things that occurred while she was working for the Obama administration. Her personal ethics are on the agenda, too -- as demonstrated by the flap over her use of a private email account. These are the issues that her Democratic rivals are running on. In Iowa last week, both Jim Webb and Martin O'Malley attacked Wall Street, Webb adding that he had also opposed the Iraq War. Both men questioned the wisdom of Clintonian triangulation -- the idea that the White House can be won, and the country successfully governed, by always seeking the middle ground. Both men would be wise to focus on Iowa; to contrast a populist, folksy campaign with the distant, over-managed style of Clinton. And both would do well to tap into a feeling that it would be unhealthy, undemocratic and plain dull to let Hillary coast to the nomination without a proper challenge. Nevertheless, there is a strange contradiction between the constant assertions that Democrats want a race and the polling evidence that Clinton would beat anyone who tried to take her on. Why do liberals demand a conversation about policy if the only answer they can still come up with is Hillary? The explanation is that the Democratic Party is intellectually impoverished. We hear often of the GOP's problems, how out of touch with a changing electorate it is and how it is divided against itself. The Democrats' challenges, however, are just as substantial. They've just been masked by having a charismatic man in the White House dominating the national conversation. Obama was elected at one of the highest points of national Democratic popularity. But, since then, Democratic power has been whittled away in successive congressional and local elections -- leaving the party without significant representation in the Deep South and absent any mildly conservative support at all. Everything was staked on Obamacare, which was ambitious and noble venture but without an obvious second act to follow. Democrats have become about defending the honor and reputation of their president rather than proposing bold new reforms. And the mood of their base can be felt either in the violence in Missouri or the disaffected, hollow laughter of \"The Daily Show\" audience. Cynicism abounds. Who really imagines that Hillary Clinton is the kind of personality that can spark a renaissance of thinking or a rejuvenation of activism among liberals? To repeat the question: what is she exactly running for? If she has one trump card to play, however, it is reinvention. Recall that she started the 2008 primaries out as a moderate, play-it-safe frontrunner and ended them drinking beer in an Indiana bar -- reinvented, in the words of Barack Obama, as Annie Oakley. If there is little intellectualism left in liberalism, at least Hillary Clinton is clever. Which is why she remains an asset to her party.\n\noutput:",

With a political career spanning over two decades, Clinton has been a first lady, a senator, a presidential candidate, and a secretary of state.

Clinton's use of a private email account during her time as secretary of state has also become an issue. Her Democratic rivals, such as Jim Webb and Martin O'Malley, have attacked her on these issues and called for a more populist, folksy campaign. Despite this, polls show that Clinton would beat any potential challenger in the primaries. Some argue that the Democratic Party is intellectually impoverished and in need of a bold new reform, rather than simply defending the honor of their president.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nPresident Abraham Lincoln never lost his ardor for the United States to remain united during the Civil War. In his Second Inaugural address he attempted to salve the nation with an eloquent summation of his philosophy and plans for putting it into practice. \"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right,\" he orated, \"let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations' wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\" The spirit of Lincoln's second inaugural was self-evident on April 9, 1865 -- 150 years ago -- when Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee dramatically surrendered his approximately 28,000 troops to Union General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Courthouse (McLean House) in Virginia.  Over 600,000 Americans -- Northerners and Southerners alike -- had perished in the bloody Civil War.  But the carnage was now about to end. The historic meeting between Grant and Lee began with pleasantries about the weather and their mutual service in the Mexican War.  The good fellowship was palpable.  Lee, in fact, had to abruptly remind the chatty Grant about the diplomatic business at hand.   After all, they were at Appomattox Courthouse to hash out terms of surrender. Grant purposely ended up being generous to Confederate soldiers. They would be paroled, not condemned to prison camps.  Rebel officers were even allowed to maintain their sidearms.  Personal property of Southerners would now be respected.  Even rations were provided by Grant for Lee's hungry soldiers. It was Palm Sunday and in the spirit of Christian reconciliation Grant ordered that no celebration occur within Union Army ranks.  \"The Confederates were now our prisoners,\" Grant wrote, \"and we did not want to exult over their downfall.\" The myth-making about Appomattox started from the moment Lee left the courthouse on his horse to travel to Richmond.   Surrendering hadn't been easy for Lee.  Sullen from defeat, his own family property in Arlington had been confiscated by Union forces (converted into a Union cemetery with lines of white crosses on the lawn). All 11,000 acres of his Virginia land holdings had been stripped from him by the U.S. government.  With no real home, Lee rode to Richmond, depressed and destitute, rendezvousing with his sick wife Mary Curtis Lee at a spare apartment.  Remarkably, the stoic Lee didn't express bitterness in public. When news reached Lee that Lincoln had been murdered, in fact, he was distraught, calling it \"a crime\" that was \"unexampled\" and \"deplorable.\" Although much remained unresolved between the victors and vanquished, the little courthouse became a symbol of unity, just like the \"Star Spangled Banner\" from the War of 1812. One post-Appomattox story that has long interested me was that of Littleberry Walker.  After being present at Lee's dramatic surrender at Appomattox, Walker, a battle-fatigued Confederate, laid down his rifle and journeyed back to red-clay, Georgia, traveling mainly on foot, passing ragged clusters of Rebel amputees, many hobbling on bayonet crutches, others with arms or heads swathed in bandages and all heading in the same direction: home. Upon arriving in Atlanta, a weary Walker found the Confederate railroad-city smoldered in ruin, the handiwork of Gen. William T. Sherman's \"scorched earth policy.\"  (One-hundred-twenty years later, Walker's great-grandson, 39th President Jimmy Carter, would construct his Carter Center, an NGO dedicated to diplomatically resolving global conflicts, on the very hilltop overlooking Atlanta on which Gen. Sherman once stood.) Upon leaving Atlanta, Walker continued walking south, anxious for his kinfolk.  Unfortunately, he returned to Sumter County only to learn that his father had died and that the family farm was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. One suspects Inman, the main character of novelist Charles Frazier's \"Cold Mountain,\" spoke for the battle-hardened Civil War veterans like Walker, when he lamented that, \"What you have lost will not be returned to you.  It will always be lost.  You're left with only your scars to mark the void.  All you can do is go on or not.  But if you go on, it's knowing you carry scars with you.\" As we reflect on the sesquicentennial of Lee's surrender at that forlorn Virginia courthouse, today marvelously maintained by the National Park Service, we recognize that the scars of the Civil War are still with us.  The Mason-Dixon Line divide still exists.  Almost all the old Confederate States are now considered \"Red\" (Republican), while the Union States are \"blue\" (Democrat) -- a residual variation of Big Federal Government versus States' Rights paradigm of the Civil War era. While the old spiritual \"Slavery Chain Done Broke at Last\" was sung by blacks in the hours following the Appomattox surrender, racism sadly continues to be a crippling national scourge. While there no longer are beatings in Congress (like in 1856 when Preston Brooks of South Carolina caned Charles Sumner of Massachusetts on the Congressional floor) the gridlock on Capital Hill in 2015, the inability to get anything done, is similarly cold-cocking the spirit of our participatory democracy. All American eyes should be fixated on Appomattox today.  The McLean house is our collective sanctuary of national healing.  As a public place, the McLean parlor remains small but the legacy which Grant and Lee made at the truce table is timeless in world history. For while the scars of the monstrous Civil War still remain, the wounds have closed since 1865, in large part, because of the civility of Grant and Lee.  With grace and dignity, these brave West Point generals gave righteous credence to Lincoln's \"with malice toward none\" finery.\n\noutput:",

Lee, who had lost his family property and was distraught over Lincoln's assassination, surrendered reluctantly. The aftermath of the war left many Americans, including Confederate soldiers like Littleberry Walker, facing hardships and scars that would last a lifetime. Despite these challenges, the spirit of unity and reconciliation embodied by Grant and Lee at Appomattox Courthouse remains a symbol of hope and healing in American history. However, the scars of the Civil War, including the Mason-Dixon Line divide and ongoing issues of racism and political gridlock, continue to be felt in American society today.",

Established on the birthday of the American founding father, Liberland -- the world's newest micronation -- is founded on a firm belief in liberty and noninterference from the powers-that-be. A tiny, 7 square-kilometer parcel of land, marked on maps as Gornja Siga, its territory abuts the Danube on the border between Serbia and Croatia. The victim of a border dispute between Serbia and Croatia, it is claimed by neither side -- effectively a no-man's land. No one lives on this patch of land, which is heavily forested and contains only badly-maintained access roads and a run-down house, abandoned for decades. This is where Euroskeptic Czech politician Vit Jedlicka stepped in. On April 13 he planted his newly-designed yellow and black flag in the territory, declaring the area the Free Republic of Liberland -- a tiny sliver of a country, bigger only than the Vatican and Monaco. He tells CNN that the country will be formally founded on May 1 and is inviting, through the media, the world's heads of state to attend a formal ceremony marking the presumptive nation's birth. He says that he will also invite 7,500 of the 300,000 applicants that applied to become citizens of Liberland to the ceremony, where he will grant them citizenship. \"I will grant citizenship if they can make it to the party,\" he told CNN by phone. \"It's short notice but a good challenge, and also for  the presidents (and other heads of state) if they can make it to the founding of our country.\" Jedlicka, an active member of the Czech Republic's Party of Free Citizens, opposes excessive government interference. He says his attempts to enact change in his home country led him to the political experiment that is Liberland. \"I would describe it as a global revolution. It's just the beginning,\" he tells CNN via Skype. Founded on staunchly libertarian principles -- its motto is \"To live and let live\" -- its website describes its system of governance as being a \"constitutional republic with elements of direct democracy.\" It will use a form of cryptocurrency -- similar to Bitcoin -- as its national currency, bypassing the need for a central bank and will, according to its constitution, keep government's noses out of everything possible, from the banks to prostitution. \"Liberland prides itself on personal and economic freedom of its people, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, which significantly limits the power of politicians so they could not interfere too much in the freedoms of the Liberland nation,\" the world's newest constitutional document states. Financial regulation will be minimal, if at all present. Jedlicka says almost 300,000 applications for citizenship have been received, about 20 of which have been accepted. \"Thousands of Americans, Swiss people. Also a lot of Arabic peoples who feel oppressed by the regimes there.\" He envisions, ultimately, a community of around 35,000 Liberlanders, not all of whom will be full-time residents.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nShe could stand on a strand of human hair, with room to spare. The microscopic polymer statue by South African sculptor Jonty Hurwitz, entitled Trust, measured just 1/100th of a centimeter and had been called the \"smallest sculpture ever made.\" But the world's tiniest woman suddenly disappeared to an unknown location, likely never to be seen again. While she was being photographed through an electron microscope -- the only way to view the minute creation -- Trust vanished, with only a smudged fingerprint left behind by her photographer as a clue. After an hour long search, Hurwitz and the photographer gave in: \"It was horror. I remember saying to him: 'You just destroyed or lost the smallest human form that was ever created in history,' said Hurwitz to CNN Ones to Watch. \"It was gone.\" But was it, really? Hurwitz is an entrepreneur-turned-artist who has applied the same tech wizardry to sculpture that he put into coding a finance site valued at over $500 million. The 45-year-old's \"Nano-sculptures\" are made from a mysterious resin -- \"a big scientific secret\", says Hurwitz -- and created through a process called \"two-photon lithography.\" Hurwitz works with a team of nanotechnology engineers at Karlsruhe University, who focus beams of ultraviolet light to \"zap\" solid the liquid resin, one 3D pixel at a time. The resulting sculptures -- he has also created a statue depicting the classical myth of Cupid and Psyche -- can lie on an ant's head. Put one into the eye of a needle, and it will barely occupy one corner. The \"Nano\" project is just one of Hurwitz' science-inspired sculptural experiments. Another one explores the properties of the mathematical constant Pi, presenting an indecipherable, \"anamorphic\" physical sculpture, whose hidden form becomes clear only when reflected in a cylindrical mirror. And he hints that a forthcoming project will also be influenced by his love of the natural world, but will sit at the opposite end of the scale to his nano-models. Hurwitz, who first made his name as the UK-based co-founder of controversial \"payday\" loans business Wonga, says he makes visual art with a team, as in traditionally collaborative art forms, such as cinema. He discusses accumulating collaborators as an aggressive start-up accumulates new talent:. \"I spent a huge amount of time scouring the world for amazing achievements of humanity and contact these people to work with them. For me the creation of an artwork these days is analogous to the creation of a film: for each piece there may 20 people involved, each one brilliant in their field.\" Hurwitz makes no secret of his desire to bring together contemporary science and art -- delighting in the fact that his nano-scale and 3D printed pieces depend on cutting edge technology, and would have been unimaginable just 10 years ago. Online, fans response has been overwhelming, he says, and the internet has become his exhibition space. It provides an \"epic scale\" that brick-and-mortar galleries can't match, he says, and estimates 13 million people have seen his sculptures since they hit the web in November last year. \"I love the buzz. I love the buzz when I launch a piece on the Internet and on Google Analytics, you suddenly see society engaging... millions and millions of people engaging.\" \"You put a few images on the internet and just watch society consume, engage and think. With comments and blogs and people saying 'It's not art' and people working out the science behind it and people complaining... I just love that buzz! I love influencing society.\" There's also another side -- what Hurwitz calls \"the traditional side of the geeky art world\" -- accusing him of being just an engineer rather than an artist. But he's unapologetic:. \"A lot of the artistic expression that I bring to the world represents the absolute current moment in human development. Whether it's 3D printing, technology or science, I love to represent the now.\" Hurwitz says the creation of the physical artwork is \"just the beginning of its lifecycle.\" So what about the missing woman, whose lifecycle has tragically been cut short? She came back to life during the filming of CNN Ones to Watch (in the video above) -- Trust v.2, her new name, has taken the absent dancer's place. Even still, there are some who think neither dancer was ever there. Invisible to the naked eye, how can we trust this sculpture ever existed beyond the computer screen? For Hurwitz, this mystery gets right to the heart of nano-scale's appeal:. \"You've got this 'emperor's new clothes' element to this end of the scale spectrum, because you look at these nano-sculptures and there's nothing there, there's an element of me going: 'this sculpture... believe me, it's there.' \"At that scale, the sculpture doesn't really exist, or our perception doesn't allow us to perceive its existence. \"In a way, it challenges the whole idea of contemporary art, by asking: 'Hang on, a piece of art you can't really see, is it really a piece of art?'\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nThe shootings' main similarity is that the officer was white and the victim was black and unarmed. Outside of that, the highly publicized police shootings in Ferguson and North Charleston bear only mild resemblance. So what's changed between the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August, and that of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend? And did the backlash and publicity of the Ferguson shooting influence the handling of the North Charleston incident? It's tough to say for sure, but here are some of the stark differences in the cases, the lessons learned by both police and the public, and concrete changes that could help mend tensions in the future. Ferguson: Officer Darren Wilson said he shot Brown after the two struggled over Wilson's gun, and witnesses to the shooting had different accounts -- often conflicting -- of where Wilson was, where Brown was and whether Brown was surrendering or charging the officer. North Charleston: Though it's unclear what happened in the moments before a bystander began recording the incident on his phone, it's 100% clear from the video that Scott was not posing a threat to Officer Michael Slager when the policeman opened fire on Scott as he ran away. Takeaway: Where Brown's killing was a breeding ground for speculation -- with a stark divide between those who said Wilson was justified and those who said Brown was senselessly slain -- no such debate has emerged in the Scott shooting. It would be tough to extrapolate for certain, but it's possible that the clear-cut imagery of an officer shooting a fleeing man in the back resulted in the prompt charges against the officer, and that quick reaction by authorities in South Carolina after the video surfaced headed off the sort of violence that repeatedly unfolded in Ferguson as the process of determining Wilson's fate dragged on for months. Ferguson: Black residents outnumber whites in the St. Louis suburb by more than a 2-to-1 ratio, yet at the time of Brown's shooting, there were only three black officers on the city's 53-member force, and there was only one African-American member of the six-member City Council. (Two more African-Americans were voted in during this week's city's elections.) North Charleston: It's closer to an even split here, with census data from 2010 showing the city is 47% black and 42% white. The makeup of the city's police department is unclear, though it's been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80% black. Three of the 10 City Council members are black. Takeaway: The ratio of white and black officers on the North Charleston Police Department appears to more closely mirror the makeup of its population than does the Ferguson Police Department, but both are considerably off. As for the city councils, the latest election in Ferguson makes its governing body more representative than North Charleston's. But before you place too much emphasis on the percentages, there are other variables to consider, like policing methods, as CNN political commentator Marc Lamont Hill pointed out. Changing the racial makeup of a department alone won't do the trick if officers aren't taught the best practices. \"Black people didn't march and fight and struggle to have black officers kill us and black officers beat us and black officers harass us,\" he said. \"I want police officers who are capable of doing the job properly. We need community-based policing if we're going to believe that police are the proper force to be in our neighborhoods.\" Ferguson: There was no bystander video of Michael Brown's death -- no concrete evidence to support or refute different witness claims about what had transpired. North Charleston: It's unlikely Slager would have been fired and charged with murder so quickly if not for video shot by witness Feidin Santana. Even North Charleston's police chief said he was disgusted by the footage of Scott's shooting. Not only does the video show Slager firing eight shots at Scott as he's running away, it also shows him placing a dark-colored object next to Scott's lifeless body. That could be significant, because Slager initially said Scott had taken his Taser and he feared for his life. But if investigators determine the object dropped next to Scott's body was actually the Taser, Slager could be accused of planting evidence. The takeaway: Ferguson resident Alexis Templeton said what happened in her city helped people across the country to feel empowered to stand up for themselves. The video of the North Charleston shooting, she said, is vital. \"If there is no video, folks don't believe it because it sounds so asinine that something like this would ever happen in this country,\" she said. \"But with a video, you can't say it's not happening.\" Ferguson: The largely peaceful protests in Ferguson were marred by looting, arson and even shootings. Violence erupted again in November after Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, wasn't indicted. And even after Ferguson's police chief resigned last month, two officers were shot during a protest at the Ferguson Police Department. North Charleston: After Scott was killed in South Carolina over the weekend, protests in North Charleston have been peaceful so far. The takeaway: Some Ferguson residents say what happened in their city is playing a role in the way North Charleston is handling its own tragedy. Lee Smith, who recently made an unsuccessful bid for a Ferguson City Council seat, said he was glad to see authorities in South Carolina charge Slager with murder. \"I am hopeful that their motives are right and not just based on the fact that they are trying to avoid the same types of issues that came down in Ferguson,\" Smith said. Ferguson: It took Ferguson police six days to publicly identify Wilson as the officer who shot Brown, and in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, then-police chief Thomas Jackson decided not to visit Brown's family. And rather than charge Wilson and let a grand jury decide whether the charges had merit -- as many civil rights advocates wanted -- the prosecutor in the case instead made the unorthodox choice of presenting both sides himself and letting the grand jury decide whether to charge the officer. North Charleston: Slager was identified by authorities and charged with murder on Tuesday, two days after Santana shared his video with Scott's family. Mayor Keith Summey denounced the shooting and said Slager made a \"bad decision.\" Both Summey and the police chief also visited Scott's family. \"When you're wrong, you're wrong,\" he said. \"And if you make a bad decision -- don't care if you're behind the shield or just a citizen on the street -- you have to live by that decision.\" The takeaway: Former Ferguson Mayor Brian Fletcher said the city has influenced others. \"I think these situations are given much more scrutiny now,\" said Fletcher, who won a seat on Ferguson's city council this week. \"They have seen what has happened here in Ferguson. Every mayor and city council is very cautious in what they say and what they do.\" Ferguson: After Brown's death in August, many asked why Wilson didn't have a body camera. The shooting spurred a nationwide debate over whether officers should wear cameras on their lapels. Three months later, President Barack Obama pledged $263 million to procure body cameras and training for up to 50,000 police officers. North Charleston: Slager also was not wearing a body camera when he killed Scott. But after the shooting, the mayor said the city was ordering an additional 150 body cameras \"so every officer on the street\" in the city will have one. That's in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, Summey said. The takeaway: Not everyone agrees that all officers should wear body cameras. Some police unions have scoffed at the idea, and the American Civil Liberties Union has cited privacy concerns. They're also expensive. Several camera models cost at least $500 each, and storing all that footage can cost as much as $20,000 a year. But National Urban League President Marc Morial said more body cameras will help protect not just the public, but also police. \"I think if officers know that their actions are being recorded on a consistent basis, it's going to protect good officers who do the right thing,\" Morial said. \"But it's also going to ferret out, if you will, bad actions by bad officers.\" CNN's Moni Basu, Gregory Wallace and Wolf Blitzer contributed to the report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nBoston (CNN)After weeks of dramatic and emotionally wrenching testimony in the Boston Marathon bombing trial, jurors deliberated for more than seven hours Tuesday. But they haven't reached a verdict yet. The jurors sent out two questions, which are scheduled to be addressed when they return to court Wednesday morning. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 21-year-old accused Boston Marathon bomber, faces life in prison or the death penalty. On Monday, the jury saw a video of the moment a bomb exploded and disemboweled an 8-year-old boy and ripped the leg off his sister. The blast killed a 23-year-old graduate student from China. The jurors heard more horror from April 15, 2013. At one point, prosecutors played a video that showed the scene after a bomb exploded -- blood and injured victims everywhere and the sounds of a child howling. His mother lost her leg. \"The defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. \"The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahedeen, the holy warriors, so he chose Patriots' Day, Marathon Monday,\" a time for families to gather and watch the marathon. Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke tried to persuade jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. \"If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened,\" Clarke argued. Bomb survivors and victims' family members wiped away tears and comforted one another in court. Tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial. Bill Richard, father of bomb victim Martin Richard, 8, craned his neck to watch Tsarnaev as the prosecutor spoke. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \"chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston,\" Chakravarty said. \"He chose a day when there would be civilians on the sidewalks, and he targeted those civilians: men, women and children.\" The lawyer waited a beat. \"He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people.\" The prosecutor showed a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, in the marathon crowd. The day of the bombings, Chakravarty said, \"they felt they were soldiers. They were the mujahedeen and they were bringing their battle to Boston.\" Tsarnaev is accused of 30 counts, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. Seventeen of those counts carry a sentence of death or life imprisonment. If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a second phase, the so-called penalty phase. That part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors, and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from Tsarnaev's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. \"He was there,\" Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. Jurors were shown a photo of Tsarnaev standing by a tree behind the family of Martin Richard. \"These children weren't innocent to him,\" the prosecutor said. \"They were American. He knew what that bag was designed to do.\" Chakravarty quoted Martin's father who earlier testified, \"I guess we were just unlucky that day.\" But luck had nothing to do with the Boston bombings, the prosecutor said. \"This was a cold, intentional, terrorist act,\" he said. The brothers' acts that day were intended, he said, \"to make a point. To tell America, 'We won't be terrorized by you anymore. We will terrorize you.' \" The defense has maintained that Tsarnaev, who was 19 and flunking out of college at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, fell under the sway of his older, more radicalized brother. \"In the past few weeks, we have come face to face with tragedy, suffering and grief in dimensions none of us could imagine,\" Clarke said. \"We've heard words, we've heard screams and we've heard cries. For this suffering and pain, there is no excuse.\" She acknowledged her client participated in a \"senseless act.\" Tamerlan Tsarnaev, a Golden Gloves boxer, had hoped to wage jihad, and his slacker younger brother was just along for the ride, the defense has maintained. During the 15-minute rebuttal period, prosecutor William Weinreb told jurors not to be distracted by the defense's \"attempt to point the finger at somebody else.\" \"There should be no doubt in your mind that the defendant and his brother are equally guilty,\" he said. They were \"partners in crime.\" Weinreb pointed out that after the bombing, Tsarnaev went to the grocery store. \"Tamerlan Tsarnaev didn't turn his brother into a murderer. To shred the bodies of women and children with a homemade type of bomb, you have to be different from other people,\" the prosecutor said. \"If you are capable of such hate, such callousness that you can murder and maim 20 people and then drive to Whole Foods and buy some milk, can you really blame it on your brother?\" The radicalization of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. From the start, prosecutors presented a compelling case in which the horrors of April 15 to 19, 2013, were vividly brought to life once again. They began with the stories of bombing survivors and first responders, who described acts of courage and compassion amid madness and chaos. The final moments of the three Boston Marathon spectators who died were recounted by the people who were by their sides. According to testimony, Tamerlan Tsarnaev set off a bomb made from a 6-quart pressure cooker, explosive powder from fireworks, duct tape, nails and BBs on Boylston Street near the finish line. That bomb, which exploded near Marathon Sports, claimed the life of Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager. Twelve seconds later, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly detonated a second, similar bomb outside the Forum restaurant, slightly more than a block away. That blast killed the boy, Martin Richard, and Lingzi Lu, 23, a graduate student from China. Chakravarty's voice grew soft Monday as he recalled the victims:. Martin's 69-pound body \"was shattered, broken, eviscerated, burned. There wasn't a part of this boy's body that wasn't destroyed.\" Lu \"received blast injuries all over her body. Her leg was torn open, and she bled out.\" Campbell died in less than a minute from \"massive blast injuries to her lower extremities. Parts of her body were shredded.\" Sean Collier, the MIT campus police officer killed three days after the bombings, \"never had a chance.\" He was shot between the eyes. \"They assassinated him.\" The brothers allegedly killed the 26-year-old officer for his service weapon but couldn't pry it loose from a safety holster. Case ends with grisly photos and testimony. Dun Meng told the jury about his frightening 90 minutes with two carjackers, one who admitted being involved in the marathon bombing. He identified that person as Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Police fired 210 rounds at the brothers when they tracked a GPS device in Meng's stolen Mercedes and cornered them in Watertown, Massachusetts. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev struck Tamerlan, who was wounded, when he charged police in the car. Tamerlan died of his injuries. \"Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop,\" the prosecutor said Monday. \"He was ready for heaven. But the defendant had other plans.\" Dzhokhar ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry-docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in Watertown. As he hid, he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called a \"manifesto\" in which he said he was jealous of his brother for dying as a martyr and reaching paradise. He also lashed out at the United States for policies he said killed Muslims, writing, \"I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.\" Federal prosecutors also presented evidence gleaned from searches of the brothers' computers, including militant literature written by top al Qaeda leaders. And they traced the purchase of the pressure cookers, ammunition and BBs, which appeared to have been made by Tamerlan. Boston trial: What defense?\n\noutput:",

Tsarnaev is accused of 30 counts, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. If he is found guilty of at least one capital count, the trial will proceed to a second phase to determine whether he will receive the death penalty or life imprisonment. The trial has included testimony from bombing survivors and victims' family members, as well as evidence from the brothers' computers and the purchase of materials used to make the bombs.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 175 words:\nThe Arizona police officer who intentionally slammed his car into an armed suspect previously faced an excessive force lawsuit in New York, according to court documents. Officer Michael Rapiejko was with the New York Police Department from 2003 to 2006. Two years after he left, he was one of the defendants in a suit filed by a man who alleged that Rapiejko pointed a gun and threatened to shoot him and handcuffed and choked him in front of his family during a 2005 arrest. The lawsuit said Luis Colon had parked his car and gotten out when Rapiejko, with his gun aimed at Colon, ordered him back into the car. During his arrest on charges of obstructing governmental administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, Colon alleged he was yanked from the car, handcuffed and choked. The charges against Colon were dropped six months later. Colon also sued two unnamed officers who arrived after the initial confrontation, court documents show. Colon and the city settled the suit for $20,000. The settlement said the defendants were not admitting to any wrongdoing. Rapiejko had resigned voluntarily in 2006, and there is no indication of any disciplinary action against him from the NYPD, a senior law enforcement official told CNN. The NYPD has said that it will not release further details about Rapiejko. Rapiejko's actions in Marana, Arizona, in which he drove his patrol car into a man who had fired a rifle in the air minutes earlier and before that had pointed the gun at another officer, have stirred debate about what type of force police should have used. Authorities said no charges have been brought against the officer for the February incident. The suspect, 36-year-old Mario Valencia, survived and was hospitalized before being criminally charged. Marana police Chief Terry Rozema was asked Wednesday on CNN's \"New Day\" whether police were fortunate that Valencia didn't die. \"That very well may be ... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,\" Rozema said. \"So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,\" the chief added. In one of the dashcam videos, an officer who was tailing a walking Valencia at slow speed reports over the radio that the suspect has fired one round in the air with a rifle he is accused of stealing that morning from a nearby Walmart. Another patrol car zooms past, runs into the man from behind, then hits a short cinder block wall next to a driveway. Video from Rapiejko's camera shows the officer's vehicle running into Valencia, with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall. Police in Marana justified Rapiejko's actions. \"We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,\" Rozema said. \"And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?' \" Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, told CNN on Tuesday that \"it is miraculous that my client isn't dead.\" \"Everything in the video seems to point towards an obvious excessive use of force,\" Cohen-Metzger said. Tucson Police Sgt. Pete Dugan told CNN that Valencia was involved in several crimes there the day he was struck, including a stealing a car that he drove a half hour north to Marana. Valencia faces 15 charges, including three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. Cohen-Metzger said he had a prior record. His next court appearance is May 18. He is in the Pima County Jail. Marana police on Thursday told CNN's Miguel Marquez that a store gun lock was still on the rifle when it was recovered. The wire that goes through the trigger and the lever to reload the gun were loose enough to allow it to still be used, police said. CNN's Tony Marco, Jason Hanna and Dominique Debucquoy-Dodley contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

The 21-year-old golfer equaled Tiger Woods' 1997 record winning score of 18 under par to realize his childhood ambitions of donning the green jacket on Sunday as he swept through the field to become Masters champion at Augusta. An ice-cool display made him the second-youngest winner -- behind only Woods, who was 155 days younger that year -- and only the fifth man to have led from start to finish over the tournament's four days. \"I miss her a lot, and I wish she could have been here,\" Spieth told CNN's Don Riddell in the aftermath of his triumph as he opened up about younger sibling Ellie, who was not able to attend the tournament. \"But I can't wait to get back to her and maybe let her try on the jacket. \"I'll have to bring her back a present from here. That's what she'll be expecting.\" Amid all the pressure of playing professional golf, Spieth's 14-year-old sister provides him with perspective. \"How has she shaped my upbringing? Well, she's the most special part of our family. She's the funniest part of our family,\" he said. \"I love having her around. She's an incredible sister, my biggest supporter. She is somebody who you can watch and then reflect on the big picture of life and understand that all these frustrations in a day, or in a round of golf, are really secondary. \"We wouldn't have that realization without her.\" At the age of just 14, the prodigy from Texas -- who was named after basketball legend Michael Jordan -- had been clear about what he wanted: his aim was to take the Masters title one day. And he betrayed virtually no sign of nerves throughout his stunningly dominant performance, letting slip only a muttered \"oh dear\" when he marginally sliced a tee shot halfway through the final round. Last year, Spieth lost the lead just before the nine-hole turn on the last day -- but he never looked like being denied this time, beating Phil Mickelson's Masters record of 26 birdies for good measure. \"To sit with this jacket on and to be a part of the history of Augusta National and the Masters was something I watched slip away last year,\" said Spieth, who described the reality of winning as \"even better\" than his dreams. \"I had a chip on my shoulder (about that). I carried some momentum into this week and it all came together, right at the right time.\" Shown a picture of himself wearing one of the most coveted pieces of clothing in sport, Spieth, born in Dallas, added: \"Putting on the jacket, it looks good. It looks good. I'm OK wearing green!\" He couldn't stop grinning as he said that he hoped to be finishing his final Masters appearance in 50 years' time, but added that he would \"still remember what it was like walking up the 18th hole today.\" And as he looked less far ahead, he revealed that he would be staying true to his roots at next year's Champions Dinner. Asked what he would put on the menu for that event, he said: \"It would be some form of Texas BBQ.\" The unassuming Spieth's success brings to mind other stars whose supreme ability and self-belief saw them become major champions in the early days of their careers. In 1985, German tennis player Boris Becker stunned Wimbledon when, at the age of 17, he defeated Kevin Curren to become the event's youngest ever men's champion -- a record that still stands today. Becker said people \"thought I had done something I wasn't supposed to do, something that shouldn't have been possible. But I did it -- and then I did it again at 18, just to make the point.\" American player Michael Chang was 118 days younger than Becker when he won the French Open in 1989, while Swiss star Martina Hingis was just 16 when she triumphed at the 1997 Australian Open. Last year, at the age of only 15, Martin Odegaard became Norway's youngest international footballer when he played in a friendly against the United Arab Emirates, provoking huge media interest and the attention of Europe's top clubs, before he signed for Spanish giant Real Madrid. For them, as for Spieth, perhaps success was meant to be from the earliest days. And as he looked at a picture of himself with a golf club in hand, taken at the age of 6 or 7 at his grandparents' home in North Carolina, he reflected on the determination that had put him in the green jacket, referring to another Major winner. \"How about the focus on that swing?\" he asked. \"That's a little John Daly-like there, isn't it?\"\n\noutput:",

He expressed his love and gratitude for her, stating that she provides him with perspective and shapes his upbringing.

Winning the Masters had been a childhood ambition for Spieth, and he described the experience as even better than his dreams. He plans to bring Ellie back a present from the tournament and hopes to stay true to his roots at next year's Champions Dinner by serving Texas BBQ. Spieth's success at such a young age brings to mind other young sports champions, such as Boris Becker, Michael Chang, and Martina Hingis, who also achieved major victories early in their careers.",

The world's leading showjumping and dressage horses have reached Las Vegas for this week's World Cup Finals. The man who arranged their travel says, for horses, it's business class all the way. \"There are two horses per box,\" explains Tim Dutta, who oversaw the loading of more than $150 million in equine talent onto a Qatar Airways flight at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport earlier this month. \"We pay attention to each horse's little idiosyncrasies and requirements -- do they like wet hay, or not? Do we use sea salt to encourage them to drink? \"I like the horses to have some quiet time too, they need that. So when the aircraft is at cruise then they are left alone for a while, to have a snooze and relax, without being bothered by anyone.\" No horse is snoozing now. The flights are over and they're in Las Vegas to work. Vegas is home to the finals for the sixth time since first hosting showjumping in 2000. The venue is the Thomas & Mack Center, a stone's throw from the Strip, which had the distinction of being opened by Frank Sinatra and Diana Ross in 1983. Organizers believe more than 80,000 fans will attend this week's event, which boasts an $8 million budget. Expect Elvis Presley beaming down from the Jumbotron; chefs from the Bellagio serving VIP guests who paid upwards of $1,500 a ticket; and tennis legend Steffi Graf presenting the trophies. In the past, that was not your usual showjumping and dressage atmosphere -- but that's something the sport is trying to change. Hosting world-class horsesport in Vegas is a way to raise its profile in the United States. As with this month's showjumping on Miami Beach, the thinking is location, location, location. For the riders, few locations are comparable. \"It's like a Wrigley Field feel,\" said Tim Keener, one of the Vegas organizers, describing how the bowl of the arena will seat spectators unusually close to the action. Showjumping comes here for the showbiz. In previous years, trophies have been handed out by flying showgirls descending from the rafters. Elvis impersonators have burst into the arena on horseback. This year, a \"selfie booth\" will let fans crowd in with leading riders for awkward photos on their phones -- and there will be quite some choice of riders. Since the World Cup Finals are among the most prestigious titles available, the cast list over the next four days features almost all of the world's top names. In showjumping, Germany's Daniel Deusser is both the defending World Cup champion and the new world No. 1, unseating Britain's Scott Brash. The Germans are the most successful nation at the World Cup Finals, with 10 showjumping victories, and three-time champion Marcus Ehning will also compete. The hosts have a superstar and 2013 champion in Beezie Madden, while 2012 champion Rich Fellers will ride aptly named \"comeback king\" Flexible, a horse undeterred by a series of illnesses and injuries which would have seen almost any other stallion retire. In dressage, Britain's Charlotte Dujardin and Valero are the runaway favorites to successfully defend last year's World Cup title. The partnership is the first ever to hold the World Cup alongside Olympic, world and European gold. Few riders are expected to mount a serious challenge if Dujardin and Valegro perform well, but watch out for Germany's Isabell Werth and up-and-coming US rider Laura Graves. Graves, 27, has barely spent a year on the U.S. senior team, yet finished fifth in last year's World Equestrian Games on board Verdades. The action begins on Thursday, April 16, with dressage reaching a climax on the Saturday and showjumping a day later. But if you miss it, the chances are you won't have to wait long for another chance. Vegas is so in love with horses, organizers are already planning a bid to bring the event back in 2019.\n\noutput:",

Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, told a handful of reporters that he had been given the information by the South Korean National Intelligence Service. CNN cannot independently confirm the executions. The nature of the intelligence supporting the National Intelligence Service allegations was also not immediately clear. North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world. According to Shin, intelligence officials say Kim is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views at variance with his own. He considers those a challenge to his authority, the intelligence officials said, according to Shin. For example, a senior official with Ministry of Forestry was executed for expressing dissatisfaction with the country's forestry program, the lawmaker said. North Korean defectors share their ordeals. The vice chairman of the State Planning Commission was executed because he objected to changing the design of a science and technology hall from a rounded shape to one resembling a flower, the intelligence officials said, according to the lawmaker. And in March, according to the South Korean lawmaker, Kim executed on charges of espionage four members of the Unhasu Orchestra, including the general director, because of a scandal, Shin said. Kim became North Korea's Supreme Commander in December 2011 following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il. According to the National Intelligence Service, he is reported to have executed 17 senior officials in 2012, 10 in 2013 and 41 in 2014.

Evacuations in the region involved not only people but animals as well. \"There is more seismic activity ... and we think there will be more activity today,\" Helmuth Huerta, a spokesman for Chile's National Geological and Mining Service, told CNN. The volcano has already erupted twice this week, spewing ash to a depth of about 23½ inches (60 centimeters) in some places, according to the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety. New advisories say airborne ash could reach an altitude of 12,000 feet. Calbuco erupted twice in 24 hours, the geological agency said early Thursday. The agency said it was evaluating a spectacular nighttime eruption but indicated it was \"stronger than the first one.\" In Ensenada, houses, trees and even sheep were blanketed gray with ash, CNN's Shasta Darlington reported. People were removing salmon -- a staple of the local economy -- amid fear of contamination from ash and lava. Trucks were used to evacuate farm animals and pets. Authorities issued a red alert for the popular tourist towns of Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas in the south. People were being evacuated to Port Montt on 22 buses and military trucks, the interior ministry said. Officials said that volcanic flows from Calbuco caused rising water levels in the Río Blanco. A 12-mile (20-kilometer) exclusion zone was established around the crater. Military and police forces were helping evacuate more than 4,400 residents, the Interior Ministry said. An additional 2,000 residents of Chamiza were being evacuated as a preventive measure after river levels rose due to volcanic flows. More evacuations were expected in Lago Chapo and Correntoso. The first eruption on Wednesday set off a bit of a panic in the region. \"At the beginning, it was small, and later, the cloud grew. And later, there was a huge cloud over you and true terror starts,\" a Puerto Montt resident said. Another person said: \"It was impressive to see an enormous mushroom cloud, with the immense force of the volcano, and to see the ashes. At that point, there was a lot of panic, lots of chaos, traffic jams, people going to supermarkets, everyone looking for water, trying to take out money from the ATMs.\" Magma expanse under Yellowstone supervolcano more vast than thought. The eruption is a first for many in the region. The last major eruption was 1962. There was a minor eruption in 1972. Calbuco also belched out a bit of gas and smoke in 1996. Alejandro Verges, regional director of the Interior Ministry, said that officials are concerned there might be a third eruption. \"The situation is relatively calm right now, although people are understandably anxious about what could happen tonight,\" he said.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nIn 1944, 16-year-old Yong Soo Lee of Taegu, Korea, was lured by a friend of hers to meet with an older Japanese man. The man took the two of them, and three other teenage girls, by train, then ship, to Taiwan. There, the girls were forced into sexual slavery, serving four to five Japanese soldiers every day for a year. Lee suffered beatings and torture, was infected with a venereal disease, was fed paltry amounts of food, faced temperatures so cold that ice formed on her body, and was never allowed outside. Only the end of World War II brought her relief. Lee is just one example of the over 200,000 women from Korea, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, and other Asian nations, who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. These so-called \"comfort women\" suffered unimaginable physical, emotional, and psychological trauma. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addresses a Joint Meeting of Congress on Wednesday, he has an opportunity to do right by these women, and issue an unequivocal and irrefutable apology -- something that carries the weight of his government. In 2007, in the very same chamber the prime minister will be issuing his address, the House of Representatives sent a profound message to the Japanese government by unanimously passing House Resolution 121, which I authored. The resolution called on the Japanese government to formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its Imperial Armed Forces' coercion of young women into sexual slavery; publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the \"comfort women\" never occurred; and educate current and future generations about this horrible crime. We are still waiting for their government to comply. In 2006, during his first term, Prime Minister Abe unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he stated that there was no evidence of Japanese coercion and complicity in setting up and running the \"comfort women\" system. And during his second term, Abe and his right-wing allies have continued to question history -- even trying to dilute and rewrite it. Last year, I, along with 17 of my House colleagues, wrote to the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, calling the timing and contents of the Japanese government report on the 1993 Kono statement: regrettable, unfortunate, unacceptable, and destabilizing. Last year, meanwhile, the Abe administration tried (and failed) to get the United Nations to partially retract their authoritative 1996 report, which called on Japan to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to survivors who had been forced into sex slavery. Most notably, earlier this year, the Japanese government tried unsuccessfully to change passages in U.S. history textbooks about the \"comfort women.\" Some say that Japan has already apologized enough and it's time to move on. To those people I say, in light of these continued attempts to rewrite history, for every step forward the Japanese government takes toward peace and reconciliation, it takes two steps back. As someone who was put into an internment camp as an infant, I know firsthand that governments must not be ignorant of their pasts. In 1942, during World War II, my government put aside the constitutional rights of Japanese Americans and systematically incarcerated 120,000 of us. We were U.S. citizens, but merely because of our ancestry, the government treated us like the enemy. Decades later, we, the Japanese American community, fought for an apology from our government. In 1988, Congress passed, and President Ronald Reagan signed into law, the Civil Liberties Act, which was a formal apology to United States citizens of Japanese ancestry who were unjustly put into internment camps during World War II. Our government made a mistake, but they apologized for it, and healed many wounds as a result. Japan must now do the same. It must show the maturity of a democratic country, apologize for its mistake, and thereby gain the trust of her sister Asian nations. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Prime Minister Abe to face Japan's history. Germany knows something about this. After World War II, Germany engaged in a painful national \"coming to terms with the past\" that ripped open old wounds so that they could properly heal. Time is of the essence. Today, there are fewer than 100 surviving \"comfort women\" across the Asia-Pacific. Each year, this number declines. Ms. Lee is one of 53 remaining Korean survivors. The survivors are dying by the day. They deserve the justice and apology that has been due to them for the past 70 years. The opportunity to speak to a joint meeting of Congress is an honor that is reserved for heads of state of our closest allies. I will be in the House chamber when Prime Minister Abe delivers his address. Ms. Lee will attend as my guest. Both of us hope the Prime Minister will take the privilege of this opportunity and finally, and firmly, apologize, and commit to educating the future generation honestly and humbly. Ms. Lee and her sisters deserve no less.\n\noutput:",

As viewers watched, Joseph Kent held his hands up and walked in front of a phalanx of police Tuesday night after a citywide curfew had started. Seconds later, several officers in riot gear rushed out of their line and arrested him, just as a Humvee passed between the camera and the police, making social media churn with questions about what happened to Kent. Attorney Stephen Patrick Beatty confirmed he is representing Kent. He was still trying to get in touch with his client after Kent was released. \"He wanted me to tell people most that he doesn't want violence in his name,\" Beatty told CNN's Don Lemon on Wednesday night. The incident unfolded live on CNN about 40 minutes after the 10 p.m. curfew went into effect and as authorities tried to prevent the kind of rioting -- part of protests over the death of Freddie Gray -- that plagued the city Monday. Kent was being held on a charge of curfew violation, according to the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. People on Twitter continued to circulate the name of Kent, a young activist, making #JosephKent and #WhereIsJosephKent hot topics. Investigators made 10 arrests in Baltimore on Tuesday night, city Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said. Seven were for curfew violations, he said. Beatty said he met with Kent on Wednesday afternoon. \"He said he's physically OK, not injured. He's safe in there,\" Beatty said. But even though more than 100 people who had been held at the city's booking center were released earlier in the day, Kent was not one of them. Beatty initially checked on Kent's status, despite not officially representing him. He said Kent was just trying to help with getting people to go home when he was arrested. \"He went out there to try to settle things down because he had seen what happened in this city previously,\" Beatty said. \"And the last thing he wanted was any more violence, and he was trying to stop it.\" Kent once was employed as an intern, through an outside company, at Morgan State University's Entrepreneurial Development and Assistance Center, the school said Wednesday. But Kent is not a student there and, as far as the school can tell, never has been, MSU spokesman Clint Coleman said. A woman who answered the phone at the EDAC said that no one there was available to talk about Kent and that she'd have no further comment. In November, the Baltimore City Paper ran a story about Kent, then 21, and his participation in Baltimore protests over a grand jury's decision not to indict a police officer in the August shooting of teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. He helped lead protesters who walked through Morgan State's campus and eventually to City Hall on November 25, the newspaper reported. \"Everyone knows me at Morgan already, organizing and making sure everything (is) running the correct way and peaceful and everything like that,\" he said, according to the City Paper's article. \"So, everybody already knows I'm going to do things the right way, so when everybody else and community people and civilians and people who joined and saw that the Morgan students were looking up to it, before you knew it, the whole city was on my back and I was just carrying the whole city.\" Complete coverage on the Baltimore protests.

He was 87. Grass died in a clinic in the city of Luebeck, where he was taken over the weekend, said Steidl publishing spokeswoman Claudia Glenewinkel. German media are reporting he died of pneumonia. Grass focused in much of his work on learning from the horror of war and genocide by exploring motifs from his childhood city of Danzig, which is now Gdansk, Poland. During the Nazi era, ethnic Poles and Jews were persecuted and deported from the multicultural city, at a time when they faced the possibility of mass murder. \"In his excavation of the past, Günter Grass goes deeper than most and he unearths the intertwined roots of good and evil,\" the Nobel committee wrote, when it awarded him the literature prize in 1999. But Grass, an outspoken public figure, has sparked controversy in the last decade. In 2006, he confessed that at the age of 15, in 1943, he volunteered for military service in Germany's war of aggression and ended up in the notoriously bloody Waffen SS. Grass said he had no excuses for his choices back then, and that, as a teen, he may even have been excited about belonging to the unit, which he saw then as an elite group. A year later, he penned a detailed account in The New Yorker on how he spent his war years up to the death of German dictator Adolf Hitler. Three years ago, Grass drew controversy again, when he published a poem in a German newspaper discouraging Germany from selling more submarines to Israel. In \"What must be said,\" Grass accused Germany of selling weapons to a potential aggressor out of guilt over the Holocaust. Grass said Israel could use nuclear weapons to kill masses of Iranians. German commentators pilloried him as subconsciously anti-Semitic. Israel invoked a visa ban, and then-Interior Minister Eli Yishai declared Grass a \"persona non grata\" in Israel, the Jerusalem Post reported. Grass' novel characters are the forgotten, the downtrodden and the weird, the Nobel committee said. And like Oskar Matzerath, the boy in \"The Tin Drum,\" they often slip into surreal situations. This was a literary innovation, the committee said, which was furthered by other great authors, such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Nadine Gordimer and Salman Rushdie. On Monday, Rushdie tweeted about Grass' death:  \"This is very sad. A true giant, inspiration, and friend.\" \"The Tin Drum,\" which was published in 1959, \"breaks the bounds of realism by having as its protagonist and narrator an infernal intelligence in the body of a three-year-old, a monster who overpowers the fellow human beings he approaches with the help of a toy drum,\" the Nobel committee wrote. The committee praised Grass' mastery of the German language and his ability to artfully exploit its possibilities of creating seemingly endless yet graceful sentences. Grass was an icon in contemporary German culture with an unchanging iconic look -- his broad mustache, his eyes gazing over the top of his glasses, a tobacco pipe a constant companion in hand. In his later years, he became known for his continuing critique of human history in the 20th century -- and of current events. As recently as March, Grass criticized the anti-Islam movement PEGIDA, Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West. He used the opportunity fire a jab at government that he said was corrupted by money interests. \"It's not Islam that threatens the Federal Republic (of Germany),\" he said in an interview with rp-online.de, \"but political lobbying. Democracy has decayed into fake democracy.\" Grass has also suggested that Germans should be forced to invite refugees from crisis regions to live in their homes as a way of offering more shelter to the world's destitute.\n\noutput:",

Follow the latest coverage of Nepal earthquake. Whole streets and squares in the capital of more than 1 million people were covered in rubble. Stunned residents stared at temples that were once part of their daily lives and now were reduced to nothing. Locals and tourists ferreted through mounds of debris in search of survivors. Cheers rose from the piles when people were found alive -- but mostly bodies turned up. The injured ended up being treated outside overflowing hospitals, where crowds of people gathered looking for relatives. Dozens of bodies were pulled from the historic nine-story Dharahara tower that came crashing down during the quake. At least 17 people were reported killed on Mount Everest, where the quake caused multiple avalanches. A seemingly endless series of aftershocks continued to roil the area, further traumatizing survivors. Residents huddled in the cold rain overnight for safety. The death toll of 1,832 is expected to rise as the full extent of the damage is assessed. The loss of life reported so far \"is really based on the information we have from the main cities,\" Lex Kassenberg, Nepal country director for CARE International, told CNN.  \"But if you look at the spread of the earthquake a lot of the rural areas have been hit as well. The information we received from the field is that 80% of the houses in these rural areas have been destroyed.\" The quake was the strongest in the region in more than 80 years. Residents are used to earthquakes in Nepal, and many thought the start of Saturday's quake was a tremor, until the earth kept shaking and buildings crashed down. \"The reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed, injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise,\" said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a statement. \"It is clear that very many lives have been lost.\" An estimated 4.6 million people in the region were exposed to tremors from the Nepal earthquake, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said via Twitter. Thirty out of 75 Nepal districts were affected by the quake. In neighboring Tibet, roads buckled, buildings collapsed and at least 13 people were killed, China's state media reported, citing local authorities. Separately, at least four Chinese citizens in Nepal -- two workers with a Chinese company, a tourist and a mountaineer -- have been killed, state media reported, citing the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu. Officials in India confirmed at least 34 deaths in three states from the Nepal quake. The quake struck at 11:56 a.m. local time (2:11 a.m. ET)  and was centered less than 50 miles northwest of Kathmandu. It occurred at a depth of 9.3 miles, which is considered shallow and more damaging than a deeper quake. It was reported by people in the area as having lasted a long time. One person said he felt as if he were on a ship in rough seas. Kathmandu sits in a valley surrounded by the Himalayas. Siobhan Heanue, a reporter with ABC News Australia, told CNN she was wandering at an ancient temple complex at the moment of the earthquake. Several temples collapsed around her, she said. \"It's not too often you find yourself in a situation where you have to run for your life,\" Heanue said, adding that she sought shelter under the table of a cafe. \"It was utterly terrifying.\" Heanue watched as residents picked through the rubble of a destroyed temple. They found 12 bodies. \"Unfortunately, that search was not fruitful,\" Heanue said. \"There were 12 bodies at least pulled from the rubble in the square. This was just one of several historical temple complexes severely affected by the earthquake.\" The Dharahara tower, the landmark nine-story structure, was packed with people when it collapsed.  Heanue said at least 50 bodies were pulled from the ruins of Dharahara. The tower, built in 1832, provided visitors with a panoramic view of the Kathmandu Valley. Are you in Nepal or have loved ones affected? Please share with us if you are in a safe place. Kanak Masni, a journalist in Kathmandu, told CNN by telephone that this appeared to be \"the most massive earthquake to hit central Nepal since 1934.\" In that quake, which was 8.1 magnitude and centered near Mount Everest, more than 10,000 people were killed. Thomas Nybo, a freelance photographer, was sitting in a coffee shop in Kathmandu's Thamel district. It appeared to be a minor tremor at first but gradually gained intensity, he told CNN. Thousands poured onto the streets of the densely populated tourist hub. \"This region is no stranger to earthquakes,\" he said. \"A lot of people had the same feeling: This is a tremor, it passed. When that wasn't the case, they were in uncharted territory... It's basically an unwritten book.\" Outside the coffee shop, Nybo said he saw a group of women gather near what had been a six-story building. One woman said children were trapped beneath rubble. \"We ran over and ran around the rubble and couldn't hear anything,\" he said. \"There was no chance that they survived.\" Nearby, another building had come down on an area where locals went to do laundry and collect water, Nybo said. A voice was heard coming from the rubble. \"A group of mainly tourists started gathering rocks, hammers and pickaxes and breaking through a re-enforced concrete wall to reach this guy... It took about two hours of smashing through wall and cutting rebar with a hacksaw to pull him out alive.\" Two bodies were found near the spot where the man was rescued, Nybo said. Not far away, lay the bodies of three or four women. \"Who knows how many other bodies lie beneath the rubble?\" he said. The streets of Kathmandu were packed with thousands of locals and tourists who didn't want to go back to their homes or hotels because of recurring aftershocks. Rob Stiles and his wife had just checked into a hotel in Kathmandu when the earthquake struck. \"It felt like it went on forever,\" the California resident said. Witnesses: \"People are panicked, running down to street\" Outside, people ran onto the street, with the temblor knocking some off their feet. A huge section of a brick wall crushed motorcycles and a car. Later, as they walked around the city, an aftershock hit. \"People were screaming and looking around,\" he said. \"There were people clearly shaken, upset, crying.\" Denis McClean, spokesman for the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, told CNN that weak building codes in Nepal contributed to the amount of structural damage. \"Building codes in Kathmandu itself have not been well upheld in recent years,\" he said. \"Efforts have been made over the last few years to strengthen these building codes but, unfortunately, this comes too late for the many thousands of buildings that have gone up across the Kathmandu Valley over the last 20 years that did not adhere to the building codes.\" Chitra Thapa, 48, a CNN security guard in Atlanta, said he spoke by telephone with relatives in Kathmandu and Pokhara, a city about 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of the capital. They were fine and were staying on streets. \"Everybody's in shock,\" he said. \"They never felt an earthquake that big.\" Aid agencies expressed concern for the welfare of survivors in the coming days, as overnight temperatures were expected to drop and people were forced to make do without electricity, running water and shelter. The international community must react quickly to save lives -- particularly those of children -- said Devendra Tak, of the aid agency Save the Children. \"With every minute the situation becomes worse,\" he said. Food, clothing and medicine will be urgently required, Tak said. The U.S. government is providing $1 million in immediate assistance to Nepal, the U.S. Embassy in Nepal said. American disaster response teams are also on their way to Nepal, the Embassy said via Twitter. \"To the people in Nepal and the region affected by this tragedy we send our heartfelt sympathies,\" Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. \"The United States stands with you during this difficult time. How to help the earthquake victims. At a hospital in the Nepalese capital, people with broken bones and head injuries were lying outside, with doctors administering CPR to at least one of them. Residents with scrapes and lacerations were  turned away for those in need of more urgent care. Fast Facts on earthquakes. The U.S. Geological Survey had at first measured the strength at magnitude 7.5 but later upgraded it. A strong aftershock of magnitude 6.6 was recorded a little more than a half-hour afterward, along with nearly three dozen other aftershocks, the USGS reported. The force of the quake was said by people who contacted the USGS to be from \"severe\" to \"violent,\" nearly the highest rating on the intensity scale. Tremors were felt as far as New Delhi, more than 200 miles away in neighboring India. An official said they were felt there at magnitude 5.0. The shaking was rated as \"strong\" to \"severe\" on the USGS ShakeMap. CNN sister network CNN-IBN reported that roads in the area were out. IBN reporter K. Dhiksit looked out his window in Kathmandu and saw the collapsed walls of many buildings. As he watched, an aftershock rattled the street. He heard \"big booming sounds,\" he said, and saw people fleeing into the streets. How are earthquakes measured? Photos of caved-in and toppled buildings appeared on social media. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet, \"We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home & in Nepal.\" Manesh Shrestha reported from Kathmandu.

        "answer": "On April 25, 2015, a magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck near Kathmandu, Nepal, leaving over 1,800 people dead and thousands more injured. The quake flattened homes, buildings, and temples, causing widespread damage across the region. Rescue crews and residents searched for survivors amidst the rubble, while the injured were treated outside overflowing hospitals. Dozens of bodies were pulled from the historic Dharahara tower, which collapsed during the quake. At least 17 people were reported killed on Mount Everest due to multiple avalanches. Aftershocks continued to traumatize survivors, who huddled in the cold rain overnight for safety. The death toll is expected to rise as the full extent of the damage is assessed. The quake was the strongest in the region in over 80 years and was felt as far away as New Delhi, India. Weak building codes in Nepal contributed to the structural damage. Aid agencies expressed concern for the welfare of survivors in the coming days, as overnight temperatures were expected to drop and people were forced to make do without electricity, running water, and shelter.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 171 words:\nThe Solar Impulse 2, the experimental plane attempting to fly around the world without using a drop of fuel, has been grounded by the weather in China. What was supposed to be an overnight pit stop in the southwestern city of Chongqing has now stretched into a two-and-a-half week stay. It's an unexpected layover that is testing the patience of the pilots and more than 60 team members, just a quarter of the way along a journey that will cover some 35,000 kilometers (21,748 miles) over five months. \"You can believe that your will can influence the weather,\" says pilot Bertrand Piccard, who comes from a long family line of explorers.  But \"then you'll be really disappointed because it doesn't work. \"Or you just know that it's an adventure you do with the forces of nature.\" Piccard, along with Andre Borschberg, a Swiss engineer, are taking turns flying the single-seater aircraft, which took off from Abu Dhabi on March 9 and has successfully flown through Oman, India, and Myanmar. There is much at stake. Their mission, which the pilots say is aimed at proving the power of renewable energy, and inspiring innovation, has been 12 years in the making. In many ways, it has become Piccard and Borschberg's raison d'etre. But so far, the Solar Impulse 2 has been spending a lot of time on the ground. The latest setback came when a Thursday takeoff was canceled, because the cross winds in Nanjing, the plane's destination, were forecast to be too strong around its expected landing time. Because of its weight, at just 2,300 kilograms -- about the same as a large SUV -- the aircraft needs near perfect weather conditions, including cross winds of less than 4 knots, or about 7 kilometers an hour, in order to fly. While the team is used to waiting, they are clearly eager to move on. \"Our boss is the sun,\" says Solar Impulse spokeswoman Claudia Durgnat. Durgnat says there may be a tiny window ahead, with the next possible departure from Chongqing on Tuesday. \"It's not good before, and the days after don't look very clear.\" Even with the delay, Durgnat says, the plane technically isn't behind schedule. That's because the team needs to wait until the end of the month for the northern hemisphere days to get longer, before the plane can venture across the Pacific Ocean to Hawaii. With more than 17,000 solar cells along the tops of its wings and fuselage, the Solar Impulse 2 stores up energy during the day, in order to power the motors that carry it through the night, typically at speeds no faster than a car on a highway. Inside a specially constructed tent at the end of the runway at Chongqing International Airport, a skeleton team of less than a dozen people works to complete the day's tasks. The rest of the crew has been waiting for weeks in Nanjing. Even with the extended stay, no time is wasted. Piccard spends a few hours of the afternoon in the cockpit, training to prepare for the Solar Impulse's crossings over the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, what the team calls \"the moment of truth.\" The plane will then return to Abu Dhabi, where it had taken off. Nearby, two technicians repair a couple of the flight computers, which display critical information in the cockpit, punching extra holes in their casings so they don't overheat. Meanwhile, Borschberg has returned to Switzerland to rest and get medical treatment for a migraine and a skin condition. The team expects him back in China early next week. Borschberg is still scheduled to fly first leg of the Pacific crossing, which could last up to five days and nights. \"The airplane is ready. The mission control center is ready. We've been waiting for that moment since so long,\" says Piccard. Borschberg and Piccard, who piloted an earlier version of the plane across the U.S. in 2013, are no strangers to adventure. Borschberg is a former fighter pilot, and Piccard was part of the first team to circumnavigate the earth nonstop in a balloon in 1999.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nMore than 22 months ago, the body of Odin Lloyd was found in an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Lloyd had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste. The semipro football player for the Boston Bandits was 27. Days after he was found dead, then-NFL star Aaron Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder. Testimony in the case against Hernandez began in January. On Wednesday, a Fall River, Massachusetts, jury -- after deliberating 35 hours over the course of seven days -- found the former New England patriots tight end guilty of first-degree murder, which carries a penalty of life without parole,  as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition. Hernandez also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide. He has pleaded not guilty. Just two years ago, he was one of the NFL's most promising tight ends, inking a $40-million contract extension with the New England Patriots. Friends and fans alike wondered: How could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be on trial for murder? Long before Hernandez made national headlines, he was a standout athlete in Bristol, Connecticut, who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty. \"I don't think there was another family that was more familiar in Bristol,\" Bob Montgomery, who covers high school sports for the Bristol Press, told CNN. The young Hernandez was the \"golden boy,\" playing football, basketball and running track, following in the footsteps of his uncle, older brother and father -- all well-known athletes in the community. Hernandez's father constantly pushed his son, requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends. \"I saw a closeness with them that I'd never seen before,\" Montgomery said of the relationship between Hernandez and his father. But his father, the man who kept the 16-year-old anchored, died from complications after a routine surgery. Hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in January 2007 to join the University of Florida Gators, and trouble seemed to follow. In just his first semester, a police report says, Hernandez got into a fight at an off-campus restaurant, sucker-punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum. The following fall, there was a shooting near a local club. Police reports linked Hernandez and several other University of Florida football players to an argument in the parking lot. Hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police, and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel. At the time, Hernandez's mother told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, \"I know he was at the club, but he never saw any shooting.\" The case remains open, and no one has been charged. Hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana, an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year. Trying to put the alleged drug use behind him, Hernandez wrote a letter to the Patriots director of personnel. \"If you draft me as a member of the New England Patriots, I will willfully submit to a biweekly drug test throughout my rookie season. ... In addition, I will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test,\" he wrote, according to the Boston Globe. Before the draft, Hernandez was expected to be a first- or second-round pick. He was passed over until the fourth round, when the Patriots selected him. By the end of his second season, he was a bona fide star, landing the $40 million contract extension. Less than a year after signing the deal, however, the Patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with Lloyd's murder. When Odin Lloyd pulled up in a black Chevrolet suburban, Boston Bandits coach Mike Branch thought something was out of place. Lloyd didn't own a car. Aaron Hernandez case: Who's who? Branch had his suspicions, but he couldn't get answers. Lloyd was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the previous night. \"He said he was at the club with Mr. Hernandez, and that they were partying and he had a good time, and that Mr. Hernandez spent a good amount of money,\" Branch recalled. Lloyd said Hernandez spent about $10,000 that night. Lloyd's friends say he wasn't a big partier. He was more passionate about football and family. Remembering Odin Lloyd. Lloyd was dating Shaneah Jenkins, the link between the young man who dreamed of the NFL and the all-American who made it. Jenkins is the younger sister of Shayanna, who's engaged to Hernandez and is the mother of his little girl. On June 16, 2013, Lloyd was riding with friends in the black Suburban, which police later learned was rented by Hernandez. Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night. As they parted ways, Lloyd told Hodge he'd see him later. The next day, Lloyd's body was found. Prosecutors say Lloyd was last seen with Hernandez and Hernandez's two associates, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver Nissan Altima. Surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an Altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m. At the same time, chilling text messages from Lloyd's phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with \"Nfl,\" adding, \"just so u know.\" Between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m., workers nearby reported hearing gunshots. At 3:29, a camera showed an Altima pulling into Hernandez's driveway, about a half a mile from the death scene. Three people got out of the car, and Lloyd was not one of them. Nine days later, Hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapons-related charges. He pleaded not guilty. In April 2014, Ortiz and Wallace were also charged in Lloyd's slaying. They, too, pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say the three men were to be tried in a joint venture, a legal term that means it's not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger as long as there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in Lloyd's murder. As the trial for the death of Lloyd neared, lawyers began arguing about evidence, including cell phones and text messages. Some rulings were victories for the defense. The jury wouldn't see the text Lloyd sent to his sister, telling her he was with \"Nfl.\" The judge ruled it hearsay and said the state hadn't proven Lloyd believed his life was in danger. Jurors also didn't hear anything about what happened in Boston on July 16, 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where Hernandez had been. The judge agreed with defense lawyers that it's far too prejudicial and irrelevant to Lloyd's murder. Investigators allege Hernandez shot and killed Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado because one of the men bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink. District Attorney Patrick Haggan described the scene in a Massachusetts courtroom in May, saying Hernandez became \"angered and increasingly agitated, particularly after Mr. Abreu smiled and did not apologize.\" Prosecutors: Bump, spilled drink led to double homicide. Hernandez's friend tried to calm him down, and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street, the prosecutor said. Court documents identify that friend as Alexander Bradley, who would go on to accuse Hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later. After leaving the second nightclub, Hernandez and the friend returned to their SUV and pulled over on a nearby street where Hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block, Haggan said. Hernandez began trailing Abreu, Furtado and three of their friends in his SUV, authorities said. He then pulled up to the victims' car at a red light and leaned out the driver's side window with a loaded revolver, Haggan told the court. Hernandez allegedly said, \"Yo, what's up now,\" followed by a racial slur, and fired at least five rounds from a .38-caliber revolver, Haggan said. Abreu, the driver, was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest. Furtado was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including one to the head, Haggan said. Hernandez was charged in the double homicide in May, and he pleaded not guilty. Investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of Lloyd.

A white banner with a blue star refers to his favorite NFL team. It says: \"Tradition, the Cowboys way.\" A few mourners trickled into the Fielding Home For Funerals in Charleston, South Carolina. Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley comes by to pay his respects and show support for the Scott family. They are not at Friday night's visitation, the mayor says.  The stress of the past week since Scott was fatally shot in the back by a North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager is too much. They went by the funeral home earlier but they are exhausted, he says. They need their privacy now and at Saturday's funeral and burial, he says. \"This is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community,\" he says, adding they share the grief of their neighbors in North Charleston and with the Scott family. \"It breaks everyone's hearts, wherever we live.\" Meanwhile, police continue to investigate the incident in which Scott ran from his car after a traffic stop then was shot while fleeing from Slager. On Friday afternoon, police met with a man who was in Scott's car when Slager pulled it over for a broken taillight. The passenger's name wasn't in a police report obtained by CNN. The passenger was detained briefly after the shooting, one officer wrote in the report. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said the man with Scott was a co-worker and friend. But he did not identify the friend by name, nor did Thom Berry, a South Carolina Law Enforcement Division spokesman, who confirmed Friday's meeting. Slager has been fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted on a murder charge. Video shot by a witness shows the officer shooting Scott in the back as he runs away. Slager had told investigators he feared for his safety after he and Scott tussled over his Taser. His lawyer, Andy Savage, said Friday he \"has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has.\" Savage's office said in a written statement that it has yet to receive \"any investigative documents, audio or video tapes, other than a copy of Mr. Slager's arrest warrant.\" The news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that Slager belongs to \"is no longer involved in the case.\" On Thursday, dash cam video and a new witness emerged from the day Scott died. The dash cam footage shows Slager talking calmly to Scott during the traffic stop. Scott apparently says he has no insurance on the vehicle, and Slager returns to his car to do paperwork. Moments later, Scott gets out of his car and bolts. A foot chase ensues. Scott never reappears on the dash cam video, but a witness later takes video of the officer shooting Scott several times in the back as he is running away. \"Nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer's life or the life of another was threatened,\" National Urban League President Marc Morial said. \"The question here is whether the use of force was excessive.\" On Thursday, a new witness emerged in the case. Gwen Nichols told CNN's Brian Todd that she saw a scuffle between Scott and Slager at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" Nichols said. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying: 'Stop!' \" Scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop, according to court records. That may be why he ran, an attorney for the family said. Criminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slager's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case. \"Defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- (that) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation, a physical altercation with a suspect,\" Callan said. \"And that would constitute manslaughter under law, as opposed to murder, and it makes a huge difference in sentencing.\" In South Carolina, a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation. What we know about Officer Slager. The investigation has been turned over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, or SLED. In a statement released Thursday, SLED said its investigators found troubling inconsistencies from the very start. \"We believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter,\" SLED Chief Mark Keel said in a statement. \"The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions.\" Feidin Santana, who took the video of the shooting, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott, who was on the ground. He said he could hear the sound of a Taser in use. Santana said he didn't see Scott go after the Taser, as Slager initially claimed. He said he believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana said. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana started recording shortly after that. His video shows Scott running away from Slager before the officer aims his gun. Slager fires eight shots toward Scott, striking him five times. A timeline of events. While the initial traffic stop may have seemed to be perfectly normal and professional, and the foot chase a reasonable choice, an analyst saw little justification for that last act. \"I'm not familiar with South Carolina police training, but I guarantee you that they do not teach to shoot a fleeing unarmed man in the back,\" said Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit. There are several claims in the initial police reports that are not supported in Santana's video. And there may be more to the investigation than just whether Scott's killing was justified, CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos said. \"If it's determined that multiple officers attempted to cover for the shooting officer, and it's shown that those reports were false, this will be a devastating blow for law enforcement everywhere,\" he said. Who was Walter Scott? CNN's Polo Sandoval reported from Charleston and Steve Almasy reported and wrote in Atlanta.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nSeveral of the world's worst terrorist groups, like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, aim to create societies governed by strict, distorted versions of Sharia law. That means anyone who doesn't subscribe to such extremist views are enemies and in danger -- Christians included. Of course, Christians aren't the only ones who have suffered at the hands of such organizations. For example, most victims of ISIS are fellow Muslims who refuse to go along with the ISIS worldview and ruthless tactics. Still, there's ample evidence that Christians have been targeted. The latest came Friday, when an Italian prosecutor revealed that a network of Pakistanis associated with al Qaeda talked about attacking the Vatican back in March 2010. \"This is ... a reminder about the world we're in right now,\" U.S. Rep. John Delaney, D-Maryland, told CNN on Friday. \"...I do think there's a larger narrative about Christian persecution (by) militant groups around the world.\" This attack wasn't carried out, but many others have been. Some acts are not centrally organized but are no less horrific, such as reports that Muslim migrants threw 12 Christians off a boat in the Mediterranean Sea. Other deadly acts and alleged plots have been blamed on established terror groups, including these recent examples:. Sid Ahmed Ghlam asked for an ambulance to come to his Paris home on Sunday after (he claimed) he accidentally shot himself in the thigh. Besides getting medical help, Ghlam was arrested after authorities found four Kalashnikov guns, a revolver, ammunition, police armbands and more in his car and residence, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said on Wednesday. They also turned up \"documents in Arabic mentioning al Qaeda and ISIS\" and correspondence with someone in Syria \"asking him to target a church.\" Prime Minister Manuel Valls later went to a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif, one of the at least two such Christian places of worship that Ghlam allegedly targeted. While he didn't elaborate, Molins said that the satellite navigation system in Ghlam's car -- which included a loaded Kalashnikov and more -- had one church's location plugged in. It's not clear what group, if any, Ghlam was working with or possibly getting orders from. Still, authorities flatly characterized him as a terrorist -- linking him to the death of 32-year-old Aurelie Chatelain, whom Molins called the region's first victim of terrorism since the Charlie Hebdo massacre and kosher market siege in January. Regardless of whether Ghlam is ever convicted in Chatelain's killing, it appears unlikely that he'll be able to commit more violence anytime soon. \"A terrorist attack has been foiled,\" French President Francois Hollande said. ISIS has turned its beheadings of hostages into horror shows, producing propaganda videos seemingly aimed at producing the maximum amount of terror. What set the one from April apart were the number of people killed and that they were Christians from Ethiopia. Ethiopia's government said Monday that 30 of its citizens were among two groups of prisoners shown being beheaded in Libya in a video released a day earlier, according to the Ethiopian News Agency. That 39-minute video shows one set of captives killed on a beach along the Mediterranean Sea, while the other group is taken hundreds of miles away, to southern Libya. \"All praise be to Allah, the Lord and cherisher of the world and may peace and blessings be upon the Prophet Mohammed,\" the video's narrator says in Arabic. \"To the nation of the cross, we are back again on the sands, where the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, have stepped on before, telling you: Muslim blood that was shed under the hands of your religion is not cheap.\" The same video brazenly claims that ISIS has been merciful to Christians in Iraq -- by giving them the choice of paying a fine if they refuse to convert to Islam. But not all have taken this offer, according to a different speaker. \"The Islamic State has offered the Christian community this many times and set a deadline for this,\" this speaker says, using the name ISIS calls itself. \"But the Christians never cooperated.\" Everyone at Kenya's Garissa University College suffered in some way when a handful of Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed the campus early this month. But death was reserved for Christians. According to AFP, the terrorists separated students by religion -- allowing Muslims to leave and killing Christians. Nightmare accounts soon emerged, like that of Cynthia Cherotich, who told CNN that she he hid in her closet when gunmen burst in and called out two of her roommates. \"(The attackers) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, ... then you lie down,\" recalled Cherotich, who refused to come out for two days. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" This tactic of separating non-Muslims from Muslims mirrors what Al-Shabaab attackers did in December at a quarry in the Kenyan village of Kormey, where at least 36 were killed, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. One of Al-Shabaab's explicit aims is to turn Somalia, its home base, into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council of Foreign Relations. But that's not its only apparent goal, as the group has increasingly branched out -- including into neighboring Kenya, which is 80% Christian -- to inflict pain and terror. After the the Kenya university attack, which left nearly 150 people dead, Nadif Jama, Garissa's regional governor, dismissed Al-Shabaab's claims that it only kills non-Muslims as \"a tricky way of doing business.\" \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that, in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Jama said, claiming the group's militants are \"bent on nothing but destruction. ... That is something we need to fight.\" Two suicide blasts rocked a Christian community in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, killing at least 14 people and wounding scores more, according to officials. And that's just the beginning, pledged the Pakistani Taliban. One of the blasts left behind panicked residents, twisted metal and shattered glass outside a church compound in the Nishtar Colony of Lahore, according to video aired by CNN affiliate GEO News. Afterward, Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan claimed responsibility for the carnage and promised more such attacks until Sharia law is implemented in Pakistan. These blasts recalled one from September 2013, when 81 people died in a suicide bombing at the All Saints of Church of Pakistan in Peshawar. Two attackers burst into the church filled with about 500 people right as services concluded, blowing themselves up, according to the Protestant diocese. Choir members and children attending Sunday school were among the dead. In a subsequent statement, the Rev. Humphrey S. Peter, the bishop of Peshawar, called the attack a \"total failure\" of official efforts to protect minorities such as Christians, who make up less than 3% of Pakistan's population. Sadly, the shock of the mass killings of the Ethiopian Christians in April may have been dulled simply because of a nearly identical atrocity a few weeks before. ISIS released a five-minute video in February showing the mass murder of Coptic Christians from Egypt. Produced by the Islamic State's propaganda wing al-Hayat Media, the video shows black-clad jihadists standing behind their victims on a Libyan beach. Some of the hostages cry out \"Oh God\" and \"Oh Jesus\" as they are pushed to the ground, just before they take their final breaths. \"The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah, we will mix it with your blood,\" a masked man says in English before the beheadings. News of this mass beheading emerged weeks after 21 Egyptian Christians were kidnapped in two incidents in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte. The ISIS video shows the beheading of around a dozen men, though Egyptian officials say all 21 kidnapped Christians were killed. Egypt's government responded with airstrikes on 10 targets used for training and storage in ISIS' Libyan stronghold of Derna, according to Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. \"Avenging Egyptian blood and punishing criminals and murderers is our right and duty,\" the Egyptian military said in a statement that was broadcast on state television. Modern-day Assyrians are a significant part of human history, tracing their roots back to one of the earliest civilizations. Their ancestors were also some of the first people to embrace Christianity in large numbers. Now the Assyrians are battling ISIS for survival in their native Syria and Iraq. This fight came into focus in February, when the militant group took over villages and took more than 260 Assyrians hostage in northeastern Syria, according to Osama Edward, the founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network. Edward expressed fears then that these Assyrians in Syria would meet the same fate as others in neighboring Iraq. Some of the Assyrian hostages taken in February have been released, but the fate of many more remains unknown. Even those not in captivity face dire threats, given ISIS's well-established reputation of offering little to no mercy to Christians. The number of Christians in Iraq has plummeted -- from 1.5 million some 20 years ago to some 300,000 today, according to estimates from CAPNI, the largest Christian relief organization in northern Iraq. ISIS isn't the only reason for this drop, but it certainly is a big one. The militant group has been brazen in its onslaught in Iraq as well as Syria, with Christians among its targets. That includes its taking over Iraq's largest Christian city, the mostly Assyrian community of Qaraqosh, in August 2014. ISIS has inflicted pain and suffering well beyond Qaraqosh, though, like its capture and control of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. The group's advance there prompted Christian families to flee rather than adhere to the ultimatum of converting to Islam, paying a fine or facing \"death by sword.\" Mark Arabo, a Chaldean-American leader and spokesman for the group Ending Genocide in Iraq, claims that Iraqi Christian children have been beheaded, mothers raped and fathers killed by ISIS militants in recent months. \"This is truly a living nightmare that's not going away,\" Arabo told CNN. \"Christianity in Mosul is dead, and a Christian holocaust is in our midst.\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nPanama City, Panama (CNN)Ending a decades-long standstill in U.S.-Cuba relations, President Barack Obama met for an hour Saturday with his Cuban counterpart Raul Castro, the first time the two nations' top leaders have sat down for substantive talks in more than 50 years. The meeting in a small conference room on the sidelines of the Summit of the Americas came as the two countries work to end the Cold War enmity that had led to a total freeze of diplomatic ties. And while both leaders proclaimed progress had been made, a key stumbling block -- Cuba's place on the U.S. list of countries that sponsor terror -- remained unresolved. \"This is obviously an historic meeting,\" Obama said at the beginning of his session with Castro, claiming that decades of strain had done little to benefit either Cubans or citizens of the United States. \"It was time for us to try something new,\" he said. ‎\"We are now in a position to move on a path toward the future.\" Castro, who earlier in the day said he trusted Obama, acknowledged there would be difficult stumbling blocks as his nation works to repair ties with the United States. But he said those differences could be surmounted. \"We are willing to discuss everything, but we need to be patient, very patient,\" Castro said. \"We might disagree on something today on which we could agree tomorrow.\" Speaking to reporters after his session with Castro, Obama said the meeting was \"candid and fruitful\" and could prove to be a \"turning point\" in his push to defrost ties with Cuba. But he said he hadn't yet decided whether to remove Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terror, an outcome that had previously been expected during the summit. The State Department provided Obama with a review of the terror status this week. \"I want to make sure I have a chance to read it, study it before we announce publicly what the policy outcome is going to be,\" Obama said. \"But in terms of the overall direction of Cuba policy, I think there is a strong majority both in the United States and in Cuba that says our ability to engage, to open up commerce and travel and people to people exchanges is ultimately going to be good for Cuban people.\" On Friday night, Obama and Castro greeted each other courteously amid an explosion of camera flashes, shaking hands before dining at the inaugural session of the conference. The two sat at the same table but not directly next to one another. Before Obama arrived in Panama on Wednesday, he spoke with Castro by phone, laying the groundwork for what will become a new era of relations between the neighboring countries. \"The Cold War has been over for a long time,\" Obama said during opening remarks at the summit Saturday. \"I'm not interested in having battles, frankly, that began before I was born.\" That exhortation, however, seemed to be lost on Castro himself, who expanded what was meant to be a six-minute speech into a 50-minute address lecturing leaders on Cuba's revolution and giving a litany of perceived grievances to Cuba over the past 50 years. But he distinguished Obama from past American presidents, saying he respected Obama's move toward reconciliation. \"In my opinion, President Obama in an honest man,\" Castro said through an interpreter. \"I admire him, and I think his behavior has a lot to do with his humble background.\" A U.S. administration official said Castro's long list of grievances was expected, despite the move toward diplomatic ties. \"(What's) unique and new is what he said about the president,\" the official said of Castro's praise for Obama. Obama announced in December that he was seeking to renew diplomatic relations with Cuba after half a century of strife, including eventually opening embassies in Washington and Havana. Obama set to test engagement doctrine with Cuba in Panama. His meeting with Castro on Saturday isn't being billed as a formal bilateral session, but Obama's aides are still characterizing the event as the highest-level engagement with the Cuban government since then-Vice President Richard Nixon met with Fidel Castro in 1959. \"We're in new territory here,\" Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said Friday. \"The reason we're here is because the President strongly believes that an approach that was focused entirely on isolation, focused entirely on seeking to cut off the Cuban people from the United States of America had failed.\" The overtures to Cuba have not been universally popular in the United States; some lawmakers were irate that Obama was seeking to engage what they regard as a corrupt government. \"A recommendation to remove Cuba from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism would represent another significant misstep in a misguided policy,\" Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat who used to the chair the Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in a statement last week. In Latin America, however, Obama was receiving a warm welcome after announcing he was seeking to engage Havana in talks over reopening embassies and removing barriers to commerce and travel. 9 things you wanted to ask about the Cuban embargo. He noted to applause during a session Friday that this was the first summit with Cuba in attendance. And he's cast the decision to reopen the U.S. relationship with Cuba as beneficial to the entire hemisphere, which has also embraced his immigration executive action. But even as Obama landed in Panama, the longstanding gulfs between the two countries' governments were on display. Dissidents opposed to Castro's regime were violently accosted this week by supporters of the Cuban government, a scuffle the White House said was unacceptable. \"As we move toward the process of normalization, we'll have our differences, government to government, with Cuba on many issues -- just as we differ at times with other nations within the Americas, just as we differ with our closest allies,\" Obama said at a meeting of civil society leaders Friday. \"There's nothing wrong with that.\" \"But I'm here to say that when we do speak out, we're going to do so because the United States of America does believe, and will always stand for, a certain set of universal values,\" he said. The long history between the U.S. and Cuba. Obama closed out his time in Panama with a news conference where he covered topics ranging from Hillary Clinton's expected presidential announcement to his framework deal with Iran on its nuclear program. The President had pointed criticism for Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. Earlier this week, McCain accused Secretary of State John Kerry of intentionally mischaracterizing what the sides had agreed to in the Iran nuclear deal. \"John Kerry is delusional,\" McCain said on the Hugh Hewitt show, a conservative talk radio program, adding that the view from the Supreme Leader of Iran of the provisions agreed to \"is probably right,\" rather than what the United States maintains are the agreed provisions. While discussing the Iran agreement Saturday, Obama brought up those remarks without being asked. \"When I hear someone like Sen. McCain recently suggest that our secretary of state, John Kerry, who served in the United States Senate, (is) a Vietnam veteran, who's provided exemplary service to this nation, is somehow less trustworthy of the interpretation of what's in a political agreement than the Supreme Leader of Iran, that's an indication of the degree to which partisanship has crossed all boundaries,\" he said at the news conference. After the President's remarks, McCain tweeted \"So Pres. Obama goes to #Panama, meets with Castro and attacks me - I'm sure Raul is pleased.\" As for his 2008 Democratic rival, Obama said, \"If she decides to run, if she makes an announcement, she's going to have some strong messages to deliver,\" he said.\n\noutput:",

It wasn't the most romantic setting -- a study group for calculus-based physics -- but Ben managed to turn it into a story worth telling by cheating. \"I set up a study group and ended up telling the other people not to come so it would be just the two of us,\" said Ben with a smile. \"He was sneaky,\" says Shelby. \"Yeah, I wanted to meet her,\" says Ben, \"and that was the best way I could figure out.\" Fast-forward eight years to 2014. Ben, now 34, and Shelby, a newly minted 30-year-old, were married and raising little Maeve, 3, and baby Hazel, 3 months, in Caledonia, Michigan, when life suddenly turns upside down. \"I thought it was sciatica,\" Shelby says of the back pain and the \"odd\" feeling that prompted her to go to the hospital. \"But I couldn't get the doctors in the ER to pay attention. So I went back the next day and told them that I was incontinent, and they did an MRI and there it was.\" \"It\" turned out to be an intramedullary glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. Shelby's version was extremely rare because it was lodged in her spine instead of her brain. \"So it's actually tangled into the spinal cord itself,\" Ben explains. \"If you'd imagine a meatball inside of bunch of spaghetti, you can't just easily take it out without damaging a bunch of the spinal cord itself.\" Surgery removed 75%. The rest was treated with a combination of oral chemo and radiation. But suddenly a second spot above the first grew worse and the area of radiation had to be broadened. After a week of treatment, Shelby suddenly lost feeling in her legs. Unfortunately, the numbness became permanent. Before long, Shelby was paralyzed from the belly button down. But that didn't stop her fighting spirit or her sense of humor. Shelby nicknamed her tumors and decided to \"terminate\" them. \"You pronounce it as 'tumah tumah-nator,'\" Ben says. \"Like how Arnold Schwarzenegger would say it if he had a tumor.\" As Shelby continued to fight and improve, in August 2014, Ben got some terrible news. The Hodgkins lymphoma he had fought and battled into remission when he was 20 had reappeared. And it probably had been hiding in his body for a few years, making it extremely hard to overcome. \"I thought it was never a concern again,\" Ben says. \"The procedures I went through, having a bone marrow transplant, I thought there wouldn't be any issues. It's been over 15 years. It caught everyone completely off guard.\" Ben was slated for a clinical trial with an experimental drug, but his alkaline phosphate levels were too high to meet the requirements. With no other options in the Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor or Detroit areas, he is now on generalized chemotherapy, hoping it will force the cancer into remission so he can undergo a bone marrow transplant. Two donors have been found that are a perfect match, if the cancer will respond. \"As it goes on, they are saying it's getting harder and harder to treat,\" he says. \"It's just like a car picking up speed. Eventually you're going to have 5 million cells, it's just going to keep growing and growing.\" Suddenly, both parents were undergoing the nausea, fatigue and discomfort of chemotherapy while trying to raise two small children. \"Some days it does feel like a battle,\" Ben admits. \"The days you are feeling absolutely horrible you don't even want to get out of bed, but you know you have to because you have to take care of the girls or help Shelby. Some days it's just way tougher than others.\" Friends and family became critical to the family's success, taking over updates to the family's online journal, and running fundraisers for medical expenses and building supplies to make the house wheelchair-friendly. \"We'd had an amazing support group,\" Ben says. \"Shelby has friends from high school who will drop everything to help us out at a moment's notice. And the community, it's just amazing for people to help that much. \" \"Even outside of our community, people we don't even know,\" adds Shelby, wiping a tear from her eye. \"We've had care packages sent from Ireland, Sweden and Australia. It means a lot.\" This January came the worst news yet. Shelby's cancer, which had retreated from her spine, suddenly appeared in her brain. Three tumors. Inoperable. What is Shelby's reaction? \"I'm not giving up,\" she says. \"Ben and I have a long road ahead of us. We know it's going to be hard, but we're going to do it.\" \"For me it's just something that you have to do,\" Ben says. \"You have to fight it and you have to beat it because there is no option.\" Maeve, who is 4 years old now, and Hazel, 1, will have a home with Ben's brother if the worst is to happen, and friends are setting up fundraisers for the girls' education. But that's not the focus of Ben and Shelby's fight. They want to get well. \"Yeah, we have two little ladies we have to take care of,\" Shelby says, \"and lots of family and friends that care about us.\" \"She's not just doing it for herself, she's doing it for her whole family, especially her girls and her husband, Ben,\" said Jay Tomczak, Shelby's older brother. \"She's not going to ever give up. What we really need is hope.\" The Offrinks would like help finding clinical trials to address the rare cancers they are fighting, as well as access to cancer centers with more advanced techniques than are available in Michigan. \"We're going to get all of our information and would like to go to Harvard or Mayo (Clinic) or places where maybe they do have more experience, and act in a shorter time frame,\" Shelby says. \"If, right now, we can find two or three trials that maybe Shelby can get into, or a trial drug for me to try instead of the path I'm on right now, it could definitely benefit us,\" adds Ben. \"We just can't wait,\" Shelby says. Her prognosis is about six months, she says, and a year for her husband. \"Never give up, because there's no reason to. Just keep fighting,\" Shelby says. She breaks into tears: \"Especially when you have someone special to fight for and everyone has someone special to fight for -- there's no one who doesn't.\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 180 words:\nTikrit, Iraq (CNN)ISIS is gone, but the fear remains. As Iraqi forces, aided by Shiite militiamen, took control Wednesday of the northern city of Tikrit, they found vehicles laden with explosives and buildings that might be booby-trapped. CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon, who was in Tikrit on Tuesday, saw a large mechanical digger packed with explosives that Iraqi forces had to disarm. The troops, she said, were cautious when they entered buildings in case they were wired to explode. Plumes of smoke rose from burning buildings in the background. Near former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces compound -- Tikrit is Hussein's birthplace -- the CNN team also saw a destroyed truck with a large machine gun mounted on the back. Iraqi forces said they had fired an RPG at the truck, killing three ISIS fighters. ISIS was ejected from the palaces compound in fierce fighting, they said, adding that there may still be booby traps. Federal police said they dismantled hundreds of IEDs (improvised explosive devices) Wednesday. CNN heard at least 16 explosions, some very loud, which police said were controlled. The potential booby traps were political as well as physical. Officials are concerned about the behavior of the conquerors, particularly the Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen who helped Iraqi troops. Officials fear the militiamen might take \"scorched earth\" reprisals for the reported massacre of Shiite air force cadets by ISIS fighters in Tikrit last year. Much of the population of Tikrit is, like ISIS, Sunni Muslim. And officials fear that reprisals by Shiite militias against the Sunni population could stoke local anger, jeopardizing the government's ability to hold onto Tikrit and pull the country together. Sectarian resentment helped fuel the rise of ISIS in the first place. 'Where are our sons?' demand families of soldiers captured by ISIS. Still, the liberation of Tikrit from the terrorist group, which is also known as ISIL and calls itself the Islamic State, represented a significant victory for the Iraqi government, which had tried -- and failed -- to retake the city many times before. Iraqi  Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi arrived Wednesday to claim the victory, which took place a year after the city was first attacked by ISIS. Al-Abadi, who is also Iraq's top military commander, had announced the previous evening on Iraqiya TV that the city was under the control of Iraqi forces. Iraqi forces continued to clean out pockets of resistance Wednesday, said Interior Minister Mohammed al-Ghabban, who was also in the city. But he said the Iraqi government would be in full control shortly. \"The enemy has been defeated, and it has lost all its capabilities,\" al-Ghabban said. \"In the coming hours, the battle will end.\" Iraqi security said that the few ISIS militants left in the city are hiding inside houses hoping to escape in the dark. ISIS' nine-month dominion over Tikrit was marked by brutality. In addition to the reported massacre of the 1,500-plus air force cadets at Camp Speicher in June, ISIS is believed to have buried victims in mass graves and to have destroyed an Assyrian church that had graced Tikrit since the eighth century. The push into Tikrit came days after U.S.-led airstrikes targeted ISIS bases around the city. Al-Abadi said those tactics would now be replicated in other areas. Brett McGurk, the U.S. deputy special presidential envoy to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, tweeted that the coalition's airstrikes had destroyed numerous ISIS shelters. \"We will continue to support courageous Iraqi forces operating under Iraqi command as they work to reclaim their territory from #ISIL,\" McGurk tweeted. The key to victory in Tikrit this time, the Prime Minister said, was surprise. But help from the coalition of Shiite militiamen and volunteers also played a part. The militia members, estimated to number around 20,000, are backed by Iran. The offensive marked the first open participation of Iranian advisers on the front lines in Iraq. The victory in Tikrit sets the stage for Iraqi forces to take back an even bigger prize -- Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. A U.S. official said in February that up to 25,000 Iraqi troops plan to return to Mosul in April or May in an effort to retake the city. Don Melvin wrote this report in London. Arwa Damon and Hamdi Alkhshali reported from Tikrit and Jomana Karadsheh from Baghdad.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nDongguan, China (CNN)For a decade, the New South China Mall -- the biggest shopping mall in the world -- has been an embarrassment for its owners and China. Opened to the public in 2005 in Dongguan in the south of the country, the goal was to attract 100,000 visitors a day with an array of entertainment, shops and eateries. Outside the mall, a giant Egyptian sphinx and a replica of the Arc de Triomphe were erected alongside fountains and canals complete with Venetian gondolas. It even boasted an indoor roller coaster. But despite the grand plans neither stores nor shoppers came. Soon, it was classified by industry analysts as a \"dead mall\" and it became an unflattering symbol of China's runaway speculation on real estate projects. The mall spans five million square feet of shopping area, making it the largest in the world in terms of leasable space -- more than twice the size of Mall of America, the biggest shopping center in the United States. When I visited two years ago, the mall was deserted. Most units were empty. Paint was coming off the walls and store signs and advertisements had faded. The air had a dry smell of dust and garbage was piled everywhere. The occupancy rate was less than 10%. It was a walk through a ghost mall. However, a visit in late March revealed a different picture. The mall was buzzing with activity. Large parts of the previously abandoned buildings are now full of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues. Visitors could be seen browsing for luxury sunglasses and designer jeans, dining at the Korean, Italian or Chinese restaurants or enjoying the new entertainment facilities. Screams and laughter can be heard from merry-go-rounds. \"It's been a big change. It's a clear modernization,\" said David Carr, an English teacher from the United States who is living in Dongguan with his wife Danae, also a teacher. \"We come here at least once a month now.\" Despite the signs of life, much of the mall is still vacant. But most of the unoccupied units, along with halls and walkways are under renovation. Even on a Saturday, it's full of construction workers and the constant sound of jack-hammering and sawing. Ms Shu, head of New South China Mall's marketing unit, told CNN that there are plans for a re-launch ceremony this spring, when all construction work will be completed and most shop and restaurant areas are leased to tenants. \"All construction that is currently going on at the mall is preparation for the opening in May,\" she said, declining to give her full name. \"We expect that from May, we will have almost full occupancy rate and no empty shops.\" She said she couldn't offer any more details as she was not authorized to speak with media. Ms Ye, head of investments, confirmed that \"business is really great,\" but would not comment further. Dutch retail chain Spar, which has expanded its supermarket to two floors, explained on its website that it had re-launched last year during the mall's \"upgrading and retrofitting program.\" There are also plenty of recruitment ads posted at the entrance of the mall. When I spoke to her, Huang Haiyan, a young Chinese woman, was just two days away from opening a little café called \"Miss & H\" in one of the passage ways being renovated. Sitting on the sidewalk outside the café, she and her partners were busy washing up cups, classes and plates ahead of the big day. \"I'm so excited!\" she said, showing the kind of enthusiasm that had been non-existent when I last visited the mall two years ago. \"You must come, my coffee is the best in China!\" The area around the previously run-down Arc de Triomphe is now a tranquil roofed boulevard with small coffee shops where youngsters play cards and mothers sip lattes. In January, a globe shaped IMAX-style cinema was launched at the outdoor square. One of the more eye-catching new sources of entertainment is a role-playing amusement center for children called Myrules World. Today, it no longer feels like a walk through a ghost mall. It's hard to believe how rapid the change has been. Economist Brian Jackson says the shift in focus towards restaurants and businesses that target China's middle, rather than, upper class, is a smart move on behalf of the developers. \"Many large malls (and residential construction) in China.... are all hoping to target one demographic -- the upper class,\" he said. \"What is needed to succeed is retail space that caters to (the much larger) bulk of middle-class Chinese.\" And, he says, other developments that were once labeled \"ghost cities\" have gone on to thrive. \"One to three years is a blink of an eye in terms of city developments, so many of these cities still have time to fill and become functional,\"Jackson said. Despite its retrofitting program, the problems that have dogged the mall since its start will not disappear instantly. Most of Dongguan's almost 10 million inhabitants are migrant workers struggling to make ends meet. The town is also facing difficulties as manufacturing moves elsewhere in China or to Southeast Asia where wages are lower. China is also haunted by serious problems in its real-estate market, with over investment and large vacancy rates. In March, prices of new homes fell for the twelfth consecutive month. What's more, the mall's latest re-launch is not its first. In 2007, the mall changed name from \"South China Mall\" to \"New South China Mall, Living City\" and a revitalization plan was drawn up by current owners the Founders Group, a conglomerate set up by Peking University, and its subsidiary PKU Founder. But the revamp failed and the mall remained empty. Now, the owners are hoping for third time lucky. PICTURES: Inside a Chinese ghost city.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nAt first blush, Brian Rogers and Caitlin McGuire seem like any other small business owners -- polite, hardworking and passionate about what they do. But there's the potential for things to get a little awkward when the conversation turns from \"hi\"s to highs. \"There's always a moment of hesitation of 'when are they going to ask us what we do?' and 'how are they going to receive that when we tell them?'\" McGuire, 25, said. She and Rogers, 34, own the Breckenridge Cannabis Club, a recreational marijuana dispensary in the historic and scenic ski town of Breckenridge, Colorado. The couple started their business as a medical cannabis dispensary in 2010, but when Colorado became the first state in the nation to allow the sale of recreational marijuana, they saw a once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity. Previously, they were only permitted to sell medical marijuana to the approximate 4,500 permanent residents of Breckenridge; when the new legislation took effect on January 1, 2014, they could then sell to any of the 30,000-plus tourists (21 years or older) who visited the town during peak season. By the end of the first day of \"recreational\" sales, they knew their lives had changed forever. The two said they brought in more than $47,000 in sales, roughly 30 times their normal daily sales of medical marijuana. The long lines and enthusiastic patrons also raised the ire of some of the residents who felt the shop detracted from the town's \"family-friendly\" atmosphere. Now, the pair's journey to build a legal marijuana empire is documented in the new CNN Original Series \"High Profits,\" which premieres Sunday, April 19, at 10 p.m. ET/PT. \"Somebody is going to become a mogul,\" Rogers said. In 2014, legal marijuana was a $700 million industry in Colorado and was billed as the fastest growing industry in the United States.  And, according to a a 2014 Gallup Poll, 51% of Americans favored legalizing marijuana, though that was down from the previous year's approval of 58%. It's a majority, but a slim majority -- and 23 states still prohibit marijuana outright. Here are the next states to legalize pot. \"We want to show people that it's not just a bunch of stoners selling pot over the counter,\" McGuire said. \"It's business-minded people -- hardworking Americans -- who are just like any other business and trying to make their dream work.\" She and Rogers are simultaneously pragmatic and optimistic about the public's opinion. It's 2015: Is weed legal in your state? \"I think they often think we woke up and it was handed to us. Our job was created; we created our jobs through hard work and investment and risk,\" Rogers said. As pioneers in a newly legalized business, the risks Rogers and McGuire face go above and beyond those of your average small business. While the sale and private consumption of cannabis is legal in Colorado, the federal government still considers it a Schedule I controlled substance like heroin or LSD, a dangerous drug with \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\" That classification makes it difficult for banks -- which are federally regulated -- to do business with marijuana retailers, even legal ones. Few even try. This is pot's $3 billion banking problem. And forget about paying for your pot with plastic. Like most Colorado cannabis stores, the Breckenridge Cannabis Club is a cash only business. Without access to banking, McGuire and Rogers are forced to pay their staff, their suppliers and even their taxes in cash. The two recognize that \"budtender\" might not be a career path any family expects their child to embark on, but for the most part, there has been surprising support: McGuire even got permission to use the remainder of her college fund to start Breckenridge Cannabis Club more than five years ago. \"For both of us, it was pretty easy to see this as a great opportunity to do something different,\" McGuire said. \"We were just working in the service industry so it's not like either of us had any full-fledged careers that we were afraid to leave behind or families that we were worried about risking or providing for.\" What's worse -- pot or booze? Rogers' family used to tell his grandmother that he and McGuire ran a ski rental business. \"Then one day she was like, 'You don't rent skis, do you?'\" he laughs. McGuire had a similar experience with her grandma, until she came to the store for the first time and saw its legitimacy. \"She thought we were just your stereotypical drug dealers,\" she said. The couple says their grandmothers' attitude shift is what they're hoping for on a larger scale: While you may not agree with them, entrepreneurs in four states and the District of Columbia are out to prove that recreational cannabis and capitalism can coexist. \"We're cannabis consumers and we support that part of it, too. But that's not what this business is about,\" McGuire said. \"It's about having the opportunity to create a life for us and have a professional career that sustains us.\" Will they succeed?

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nIndonesia has a tough stance on drug smugglers, and since assuming office in October, President Joko Widodo has made it clear he intends to show no mercy toward those found guilty of such crimes. That tough stance casts a further pall on two Australian drug smugglers, part of the so-called \"Bali Nine.\" They are waiting to learn whether they will be put to death by firing squad after an Indonesian court rejected a last ditch effort to gain clemency from Widodo on Monday. April marks a decade on death row for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for their part in a failed heroin smuggling plot. The 31-year-old Chan has been called the ringleader and 33-year-old Sukumaran has been described as his collaborator.  The seven others who took part in the operation are serving lengthy prison sentences for trafficking the drugs. The members of the Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Four members of the group were caught at Denpasar International Airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies.  Four others, including Sukumaran, were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta.  Although he wasn't carrying any drugs, Chan was detained after boarding a plane to Sydney.  He was named by others as the mastermind of the smuggling plot. While the purported ringleaders have received media attention for years, the other seven members of the Bali Nine have rarely been in the spotlight. Here's a quick look at the other members of the group:. Scott Rush. Indonesian prosecutors asked for and received a sentence of life in prison for several of the Bali Nine, who were identified as drug couriers in the operation. That includes Scott Rush of Brisbane, Australia. Rush was 19 when he was captured in Indonesia. He was arrested at Denpasar Airport with more than 1 kilogram of heroin strapped to his body. Michael Czugaj. Life in prison was the original sentence for 29-year-old Michael Czugaj, also of Brisbane. Nineteen at the time of his arrest, Czugaj is one of five of the Bali Nine whose sentence was reduced to 20 years in prison, then reinstated at life again.  During his trial, Czugaj testified he was lured into the drug scheme with the promise of a free holiday to Bali. He was quoted in news reports as saying his life was threatened, as well as his family's, if he refused to cooperate with the heroin smuggling operation. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen from Brisbane, who is now 31, was one of four drug couriers in the case. He was found in a hotel room on Bali's Kuta Beach with a small amount of heroin and drug paraphernalia. Si Yi Chen and Matthew Norman. The others are Si Yi Chen, 30 and Matthew Norman, 28, both from Sydney.  Foreignprisoners.com quotes Chen as saying he deeply regrets his actions and did not mean to hurt others, especially his family.   Norman is quoted on the same website expressing remorse for his actions and hopes that people back home, \"don't judge me too harshly.\"  He says he has two sisters including a twin. Foreignprisoners.com is run by Foreign Prisoner Support Service, a nonprofit organization based in South Africa. Martin Stephen and Rena Lawrence. The same website details information about Martin Stephens, now 39, and the only woman in the Bali Nine, 37-year-old Renae Lawrence. Stephens was a former bartender from Towradgi, a suburb of Wollongong in New South Wales. He claims he was forced to travel to Bali and take part in the drug smuggling operation after death threats against his family. Lawrence, from Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, was arrested with heroin strapped to her body.  She claims Chan threatened her life if she did not take part in the scheme.  During her court appeal, Lawrence apologized to Indonesia for her actions.  Her original life sentence was also reduced to 20 years. During a court appearance in 2006, Chan denied threatening anyone.  He told the Denpasar District Court before his sentencing in February of that year:  \"A lot of lies have been said against me, but the true reality is I'm not what people put me out to be. I've never threatened anybody in my life.\" The Denpasar District Court also dismissed claims that Chan made threats against Lawrence and Rush when the two were sentenced in 2006. Australia has repeatedly called for clemency for Chan and Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Monday, \"The Government is disappointed at today's decision by the State Administrative Court of Jakarta to reject the appeals of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. We understand that the legal team for Mr. Chan and Mr. Sukumaran is considering other legal options.\" In a news release posted to the Australian government's website, Bishop cited the \"extensive rehabilitation\" both men have undergone and said she will continue to appeal to her counterpart while Australia continues to \"use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution.\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nNairobi, Kenya  (CNN)They were sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, friends and fellow citizens. They were students and dreamers, pursuing their ambition for a better life. And on Tuesday night, Kenyans remembered them as innocent victims of a terrorist attack that stunned a nation and left communities heartbroken. The gathering started with quiet chatter among a crowd of hundreds before mourners went silent and moved toward one end of Nairobi's Uhuru Park. Organizers unloaded 147 crosses from a truck and quietly planted them in the ground. Mourners read names of some of the victims as candles flickered in the dark. The crowd then sang the national anthem. The attack at a university in Garissa on Thursday killed 147 people, mostly students. The Al-Shabaab militant group claimed responsibility. As the country mourned the victims, others took to social media to humanize them by sharing their stories. They talked about aspiring lawyers, doctors and teachers. \"I can't even look at pictures of the people killed without crying,\" said Mary Wambui, 32, who lives in Nakuru, hundreds of miles from Garissa. \"They were just children. They were trying to make a better life for themselves. Some were first to go to college in their communities. They died trying to get an education.\" Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber, Kenyans used social media to talk about the lives of the victims. They shared pictures of beaming faces, full of life and energy, in happier days. They talked about parents too shocked to speak after identifying their children's bodies. \"We need to talk about the bright futures cut short,\" said Boniface Mwangi, who organized the vigil. \"Today's meeting will be a calling to say, 'We need to remember the 147; they are not just a number.' We are trying to avoid remembering these people as just a number.\" Some students remain unaccounted for, and wailing relatives alternate their searches between hospitals and morgues. Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the names of the victims. At Uhuru Park, right next to the crosses, a bulletin board featured 32 photos of the young students. \"With the previous attacks, there's been a sense of the victims just being numbers,\"  Doreen Areri said. \"The idea behind this is to have faces behind the numbers. We need to hear their stories, their dreams.\" Kellie Murungi said she got some solace from the vigil. \"In 2010, I was in a grenade attack in downtown Nairobi and every time there's a terrorist attack, it hits too close to home,\" Murungi said. \" It's not just happened to me, but many others.\" The vigil was important for the healing process, she said, because \"we shouldn't have people walking around with scars.\" It was the deadliest attack in the nation since al Qaeda killed more than 200 people at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998. In the Garissa attack, the terrorists separated Christians from Muslims, making some recite verses from the Quran. Those who couldn't quote the holy book tried to flee the gunfire, but whizzing bullets sent them to the ground. Others scampered into closets and stayed there for hours. Images from the scene showed heaps of students, faces down, lying in pools of blood. \"Those images will haunt us forever,\" said Martin Otieno, 29, who lives in Nairobi. \"As a nation, we should never let this happen. We just can't.\" Kenya launched airstrikes Monday targeting Al-Shabaab's training camps in Somalia, according to a military source, adding that the strikes were not retribution for last week's massacre at the university. \"The latest attack of Al-Shabaab bases by the Kenya military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011. It is not a retaliation to the Garissa attack. The operation has been ongoing,\" the source said Monday. Kenyan authorities had intelligence beforehand that a university in Garissa could be attacked, yet the country's rapid response team was stuck in Nairobi for hours after the massacre awaiting transport, a police source said Monday. It's unclear why the elite team was stuck in the Kenyan capital about 230 miles (370 kilometers) west of the attack. Kenyan politicians and Nairobi-based journalists arrived on the scene before the team did. Once the team entered the university complex, the hourslong siege was quickly defused. But a government spokesman defended the response time. \"With the benefit of hindsight, you can always say things could have been done better,\" said Manoah Esipisu, a spokesman for Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. However, he added, Kenyan authorities \"got the job done\" and saved lives. Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed echoed that sentiment in an interview with CNN on Monday. She denied reports that an elite rapid response team single-handedly ended the siege. \"We have a military garrison in Garissa, and the work began immediately after the attack was reported and continued for a number of hours until we were able to rescue 663 students of the 800 students that had been taken hostage by these terrorists. So the response was adequate,\" she said. \"We did everything that we could do.\" Kenya's Interior Ministry named Mohamed Mohamud as the organizer of the attack. The  senior Al-Shabaab leader is also known by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, it said. The ministry offered  a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, or about $215,000, for information on his whereabouts. He is in charge of external operations against Kenya, according to a government document, and commands the militia along the border. Another terrorist involved in the attacks is Abdirahim Abdullahi, a Kenyan-Somali  and the son of a  government chief in Mandera, authorities said. Mandera is in northern Kenya. Dorm becomes scene of a slaughter. Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia, and its violence has spread to Kenya before.  In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, leaving 67 people dead. The terror group has intensified attacks in Kenya since the country sent troops to Somalia four years ago to help battle the militants. CNN's David McKenzie and Joseph Netto reported from Nairobi, and Faith Karimi reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed from Los Angeles.\n\noutput:",

This article will provide a clear, no-nonsense assessment of Xanax's role in anxiety treatment, dispelling any exaggerations that might have taken root in popular belief.\nThe Xanax Dilemma: Unraveling the Myths\nXanax, also known by its generic name alprazolam, is commonly prescribed to alleviate symptoms of anxiety. However, its effectiveness has been a subject of debate in medical circles.\nUnderstanding Xanax's Mechanism of Action\nXanax belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which work by enhancing the effects of a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. This leads to a calming effect, reducing excessive brain activity that can contribute to anxiety.\nThe Short-Term Soother\nXanax is known for its rapid onset of action, providing quick relief for acute anxiety episodes. This makes it a valuable tool in emergency situations or for short-term use.\nThe Tolerance Conundrum\nOne of the primary concerns with Xanax is the potential for tolerance development. Over time, the body may become accustomed to the medication, necessitating higher doses for the same effect. This can lead to a cycle of increasing dosage, which poses risks for dependence and withdrawal symptoms.\nLong-Term Considerations\nFor chronic anxiety management, other treatment options like therapy, lifestyle modifications, or alternative medications may be more sustainable. Long-term Xanax use requires careful monitoring and should be complemented with strategies to address the root causes of anxiety.\nConclusion: A Balanced Perspective\nWhile Xanax can be an effective tool for managing acute anxiety, it's important to approach its use with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Understanding its benefits and limitations allows individuals to make informed decisions about their mental health treatment.\nIn the broader context of anxiety management, a holistic approach that incorporates various strategies is often the key to long-term well-being. Remember, no single solution fits all, and seeking professional advice is crucial in navigating the complexities of anxiety treatment.\nAttribution\nMedical News Today\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/xanaxs-effectiveness-for-treating-anxiety-may-be-exaggerated\noutput:",

That will start to impact temperatures some beginning Thursday. We will probably have clouds to start the day with the long nights producing low clouds and fog, and then developing sunshine taking highs to the mid and upper 70s.\nA cold front will approach Friday as low pressure moves east across the Great Lakes and into Southeastern Canada. The front will be slowing down as it heads east and this is going to be due to Tropical Storm Philippe which will be moving up the east coast offshore. Philippe will be headed possibly for Nova Scotia over the weekend so the front slows until the tropical cyclone moves northward and then swing through the Eastern US Friday night and Saturday.\nFriday we will see arriving clouds and perhaps a couple of scattered showers during the day. Friday highs will be in the mid to upper 70s. Showers and a few thunderstorms will become more numerous overnight into Saturday and it looks like we will have to wait until late in the day Saturday for a front to pass and for showers to end. Saturday highs will be in the upper 60s to around or just over 70.

This year, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is taking a fresh approach with their \"Wild to Mild\" campaign. Using animals as metaphors, the campaign highlights the vaccine's ability to weaken the flu's ferocity, transforming it from a roaring lion to a gentle kitten:\nWhile many have been conditioned to think of vaccines in binary terms—either they prevent illness or they don't—the reality is more intricate.\nDr. Sarah Bauerle Bass, a health communication expert at Temple University, points out that while some vaccines, like those for measles and polio, offer near-complete protection, the flu vaccine operates differently. This is primarily because the flu virus is a master of disguise, constantly evolving and presenting new challenges for our immune defenses.\nUnlike the static nature of measles or polio, the flu is a dynamic adversary. It's a collection of viruses, and the vaccine typically targets only a select few strains. These strains are chosen based on predictions from the Southern Hemisphere's flu activity, a method that, while scientifically grounded, isn't foolproof.\nTo the casual observer, the flu vaccine might seem less effective, with protection rates hovering between 40-60% during well-matched seasons. This has led to a pervasive myth that the vaccine is subpar. However, this perspective misses the broader picture as the vaccine's primary goal isn't just to prevent infection but to mitigate the severe consequences of the flu.\nSo, while the vaccine might not always prevent a runny nose, it's adept at shielding vital organs from the virus, reducing hospitalizations and saving lives. The \"Wild to Mild\" initiative aims to recalibrate public understanding, emphasizing the vaccine's role in transforming a potentially lethal illness into a more manageable one.\nHowever, the public's relationship with vaccines has evolved over the decades. Dr. Howard Markel, a medical historian, notes that while vaccines were once celebrated as miraculous gifts, modern perceptions are more varied and, at times, skeptical. This skepticism has extended to the COVID vaccine, which, like the flu vaccine, has faced misconceptions about its efficacy.\nDespite these challenges, the CDC remains optimistic. While not everyone will choose to get vaccinated, the goal is to reach the undecided majority with compelling messaging. The \"Wild to Mild\" campaign encapsulates the essence of the flu vaccine: it might not be perfect, but it's a powerful tool we have right now.\noutput:",

Coleman is accused of killing his two young children in Mexico with a spearfishing gun, claiming they possessed 'serpent DNA'.\nThe decision came on Wednesday, October 9, when the judge announced that Coleman was not competent for the trial. This announcement also implies that any further criminal proceedings against him will be halted.\nAs reported, Coleman's tragic actions were heavily influenced by the QAnon conspiracy theories. In his admission to the FBI, he mentioned that he believed his actions were the only solution to \"save the world.\"\nInvestigations revealed that in August 2021, Coleman drove his kids from their Santa Barbara residence to a ranch in Mexico. Two days into their stay, he took the life of his 2-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter using a speargun. Following the murders, Coleman returned to his motel room. It was a ranch worker who discovered the lifeless bodies of the children and reported the gruesome sight to the authorities. Coleman's arrest took place at the US border while he was trying to return.\nMatthew Coleman's spouse, during her interactions with the officials, confirmed that he had left with their kids in the family van without mentioning their destination. Even though he hadn't given her a clue about their whereabouts, she was optimistic that her children were safe. She also indicated that there had been no discord between the couple preceding his departure.\nDocuments presented in court reveal more about the family's plans that fateful day. They were supposedly set for a camping trip, but Coleman unexpectedly left with the kids. His wife, referenced as AC in the documents, grew worried, particularly because Coleman hadn't taken the car seat with him. She tried reaching him via text and calls to no avail. When approached by law enforcement, AC expressed her belief that Coleman would eventually come back and that she wasn't in danger. She further declined any immediate assistance.\nThe court has scheduled a status hearing for December 1, with a competency review set for March 8, 2024.\noutput:",

Decades and still no identity\nLost Among Us: The Silent Cry of Baby Jane Doe #61\nLos Angeles was left heartbroken on a day in late summer. On August 19, 1985, amidst the bustling city sounds, silence roared from an alley in Baldwin Hills (4206 Santo Tomas). Here, a life was stolen too soon. The fragile remains of a 10-month-old child, whom the world would come to remember as Baby Jane Doe #61, lay as a testament to the profound neglect she endured. The child, with an innocence that was prematurely ended, was discovered emaciated. Investigations later confirmed a life lost to pneumonia, a result of harrowing malnutrition. This grievous neglect declared her passing as a criminal act, an act of homicide.\nBut, amidst this despair, a glimmer of perhaps a once cherished life showed – her ears bore delicate piercings, hinting at moments of care. The investigative team could find no indications of any s exual assault. However, physical scars and memories of broken bones that had healed over time painted a harrowing story of physical abuse. Strangely, her teeth seemed larger than one would expect for a child her age.\nA chilling aspect of this heartbreaking story was the void surrounding her identity. None of the missing children records matched her description. No cries of a missing baby echoed in the alleys of Los Angeles. It seemed as though she was a ghost, forgotten by the world.\nDecades have since passed, and Baby Jane Doe #61's identity is still cloaked in mystery. Even as media, in its sporadic attempts, tried to shed light on her story, no one stepped forward. The secrets locked within her DNA still await the key – a family member's matching DNA – to unveil her true identity.\nThe memory of a petite figure, 2 feet 2 inches in height, weighing a mere 14 pounds, with dark, perhaps once lively eyes and flowing brown or black hair, lingers on. Time has eroded the features of her face, but a skilled forensic artist attempted to bring her image back to life. A hopeful representation of what she might have looked like graces the top of this article. Had fate been kinder, Baby Jane Doe #61 would have been celebrating her 34th year.\nIf your heart holds any clue, or if a memory sparks, please reach out to the Los Angeles Police Department at 1-877-LAPD 24-7 (1-877-527-3247). The quest for justice, and her true identity, continues. Her case number is 85-03-24266.\noutput:",

They’re not asking for charity. What they want is just the chance that everyone wants, to chase the American Dream and be able to work.”\n“We have people here who want to work, we have employers who want to hire them, we have a Congress who stood in the way of their ability to do that. I think that's the biggest challenge we see right now.”\n“We know if people are here without work authorization, we are going to need more federal support to support them. But our focus is really trying to get them access to work.”\n“We think if you bring someone to the country and tell them they can't work, there's no choice but to either encourage them to break the law or to make them survive on public subsidy and we think neither of those are good options.”\nIn addition, Denver sent letters to border town officials asking migrants not to come to the City.

Meanwhile, for park goers who want a more inclusive experience in the parks, the Disney Incredi-Pass, their highest-tiered pass, went up by $50, from $1,449 to $1,449 (or $111.52 per month).\nParking at the House of the Mouse will also be a little more expensive. Prices at Walt Disney World will increase $5, to $30, which, according to UPI News, will bring its parking prices more in line with Orlando’s other giant theme park resorts. To make up for the increase in ticket prices, the company is bringing back All Day Park Hopper Access to annual pass holders.\nAccording to its Disney Parks blog, starting on January 9th, annual pass holders will now be able to visit any of Disney World’s parks at any time of the day during operating hours. Currently, Park Hopper Access is only available after 2 p.m. Other changes being made for annual passholders include a return to complimentary self-parking at all Disney World Resort hotels, and the return of parking trams, which were halted during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe raise in ticket and parking prices comes as The Walt Disney Company is preparing to spend over $60 billion in its parks over the next 10 years, which also includes the company’s overseas theme parks and the Disney Cruise Line.\nArticle by Kareem Gantt\noutput:",

After meticulous police investigations, which included phone records and surveillance footage, the perpetrator, a coworker obsessed with the victim, was apprehended and sentenced to life without parole.\nOn the early morning of October 28, 2020, Fox's boyfriend discovered her lifeless body, having been shot twice in the head, in their driveway. Despite the gloomy weather, the Stark County Sheriff's Office sprung into action, recognizing the importance of evidence like her discarded cellphone nearby. \"Such devices carry invaluable data,\" commented Sgt. Craig Kennedy.\nAs officers peeled back layers of the victim's life, a troubling narrative emerged, pointing to Jason Alan McDermitt, a coworker. Although initially McDermitt's alibi seemed strong, his infatuation with Fox became evident as detectives delved deeper. They found thousands of videos and photos of Fox on McDermitt’s device, many taken covertly, revealing an unhealthy obsession.\nFurther cementing McDermitt's involvement was surveillance footage showing his vehicle near Fox’s home around the estimated time of the murder, contradicting his earlier claims. Coupled with a damning video of him meticulously cleaning his car post-murder and tire track evidence matching his vehicle at the crime scene, authorities had ample evidence.\nIn court, the emotional climax came when Fox’s 11-year-old daughter bravely faced McDermitt, condemning him for depriving her of a mother's love and milestones. \"Monsters were myths, until you proved me wrong,\" she said, highlighting the profound pain he inflicted on many.\nNow, as McDermitt serves a life sentence, the harrowing case serves as a stark reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows, sometimes closer than we think. For a comprehensive look at the case, viewers can turn to \"Caught in the Net\" streaming on Max.\noutput:",

This nationwide interruption is just a test – a part of FEMA's routine to ensure the reliability and efficiency of its Emergency Alert System.\nTesting Times: When to Expect the Alert\nScheduled for 2:20 p.m. EDT, this alert will roll out across various time zones, including:\n1:20 p.m. CDT\n12:20 p.m. MDT\n11:20 a.m. PDT\nPhones will display a clear message: “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.” Spanish-speaking users can expect the notification to read: “ESTA ES UNA PRUEBA del Sistema Nacional de Alerta de Emergencia. No se necesita acción.”\nThat Familiar Tone: A Blast from the Past\nJeremy Edwards, FEMA's spokesperson, stated that the alert will be the very same audio tone familiar to countless Americans. Rooted in history, this unique sound dates back to 1963, established by President John F. Kennedy, marking the inception of the original Emergency Broadcast System.\nInterestingly, this tone isn't just for nationwide alerts. Over 1,700 local, state, territorial, and tribal authorities use this very sound for localized emergency alerts.\nWhy The Test?\nThe main aim of these tests is to evaluate the effectiveness of FEMA's alert systems. Conducted once every three years, the last test was as recent as Aug. 11, 2021. A potential reschedule is in the cards for Oct. 11, should there be severe weather or significant events.\nWho Will Get the Message?\nWhile the majority will receive the alert, there are exceptions. Phones that are off, set to airplane mode, or not within cell tower coverage might not get the alert. Additionally, some older phones might miss out, especially if the user is on a call.\nA Word of Caution\nIt's vital to differentiate real alerts from casual references. The FCC recently proposed a hefty fine for FOX, resulting from the inappropriate use of EAS tones during an NFL promo segment. The intent is clear: these tones have a unique purpose, and its sanctity must be preserved.\nIn conclusion, come Wednesday, when that familiar tone sounds, remember it's a test. Stay informed, stay safe, and always be prepared.\nSource: Newscentermaine.com\nDid this story resonate?

The team would trade the final three points and Barnstable won the set 25-22 before closing out the match with a 25-15 third set.\nDespite sharing the same final score, Viselli said Monday’s match was a big step up for Nantucket from its first match against the Red Hawks earlier this season.\n“It was night and day,” Viselli said. “We went into their gym and we were afraid, we were tense. You can’t even say that we played when we went to Barnstable. The aura, the mystique, the fans, everything, they just played scared. This time they were like ‘we're here to play’ and they played and they just came up short.”\nNow 10-7 on the year, Nantucket will wrap up the regular season this week with matches Wednesday at Sturgis East and Friday at home against St. John Paul II.\noutput:",

Brought up by her grandmother and deeply bonded with her aunt and elder sister, Shantavia, Jasmine had a radiant personality. Her prowess on the basketball court during her high school years earned her the nickname “Beezy,” which stuck even into her adult life. A church choir singer with an infectious sense of humor, she was a beacon of happiness to those around her.\n2018 brought a new chapter to Jasmine's life when she learned she was expecting a baby. Eagerly looking forward to motherhood, she had chosen the name \"Jamillia\" for her soon-to-be-born daughter. However, fate had different plans, and in a twist of events, Jasmine mysteriously disappeared in 2019, while she was seven months into her pregnancy.\nOn the evening of February 18, 2019, after being dropped home by her grandmother, Jasmine was alone. It's unclear where her grandmother headed, but something had perturbed Jasmine that day, though she refrained from discussing it with anyone. Later that night, during a seemingly routine phone call with her aunt, Jasmine gave no hint of any distress. They made plans for her prenatal checkup the next day.\nHowever, when the time came, Jasmine was nowhere to be found. Calls to her went unanswered, and it soon became evident that something was amiss. Growing increasingly anxious, her family reported her missing on February 20th.\nDisturbingly, in the days leading up to her disappearance, Jasmine had confided in her sister Shantavia about unwelcome attention she was receiving from her unborn child's father. His insistent calls at her workplace and on her personal phone were unsettling to Jasmine. He didn’t seem supportive of the pregnancy, but Jasmine was determined to embrace motherhood, regardless of his views.\nThe police investigation hinted at Jasmine not being alone when she last left her grandmother’s home. Indications suggest that her departure wasn't of her own volition. Adding to the mystery, all her personal belongings, including essentials like her purse, remained untouched at her home. While authorities have questioned several individuals, it remains unknown if the baby's father has been cleared of suspicion.\nThe quest to uncover the truth about Jasmine Robinson and her unborn child remains ongoing. Today, were she with us, Jasmine would be celebrating her 27th birthday. Anyone with potentially valuable information is urged to reach out to the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office at 352–367–4083.

Distraught, her mother, Shashu Battiste, implored the authorities for answers during an interview with 11 Alive, saying, “My child was arrested for a misdemeanor and lost her life in custody. We need answers!”\nReports from the Fulton County Sheriff’s Department describe a grim scene: Battiste-Kosoko was found alone during dinner time, with no visible injuries. Adding another layer to the mystery, Fox 5 Atlanta reported that the teen had a known mental health diagnosis.\nPromising to leave no stone unturned, the family emphasized their intent to investigate this tragic event fully. They assert that if any negligence on the part of the jail staff is identified, those responsible will face the consequences.\nAn anonymous source from the same jail claimed to Fox 5 that the institution had failed to address Battiste-Kosoko’s evident needs, stating, “From the moment she arrived, it was evident she required specialized attention. Clearly, she needed support.”\nThis incident emerges amid a broader probe by the Department of Justice into Fulton County Jail’s treatment of inmates, especially those with mental health challenges. Allegations suggest a pattern of neglect, discrimination against those with mental conditions, and subpar medical care. Kristen Clarke, from the Justice Department’s civil rights division, emphasized that incarceration doesn't strip individuals of their basic rights, asserting, “Inmates retain their constitutional and civil rights. These aren't forfeited upon entering a facility.”\nA significant statistic shared by Clarke highlights that a staggering 87% of Fulton County Jail's inmates are Black, which she flags as a “racial justice concern.”\nClarke also recalled the harrowing case of 35-year-old Lashawn Thompson, who passed away in the same facility last September. His cell conditions, riddled with bedbugs and trash, exposed a systemic issue. After his demise, evidence unveiled that the mental health ward where Thompson was housed was plagued with insects, with most inmates in the unit showing signs of malnutrition and severe neglect.\nThis disturbing pattern underscores the urgent need for reform and accountability within correctional facilities.\noutput:",

As we have said, where the challenged law ‘makes clear that [another agency] is the agency responsible for the [law’s] administration and enforcement,’ only that agency is a proper defendant under Ex parte Young.”\nHe also added:\n“[E]ven assuming the governor has directed DPS to pull over plaintiffs via this executive order, that instruction is in the past. DPS alone will enforce the order in the future.”\nHear what Governor Abbott said two years ago on the executive order:\nThis is good news for Governor Abbott who continues to send migrants to sanctuary cities as they overwhelm border cities such as El Paso, Del Rio, Brownsville, and other cities.\nAccording to a press release, Governor Abbott has bussed over 60,000 migrants to sanctuary cities.\nOver 12,500 migrants to Washington, D.C. since April 2022\nOver 21,800 migrants to New York City since August 2022\nOver 17,200 migrants to Chicago since August 2022\nOver 3,200 migrants to Philadelphia since November 2022\nOver 5,100 migrants to Denver since May 18\nOver 1,000 migrants to Los Angeles since June 14\nGovernor Abbott is also challenging President Biden over allowing illegal immigrants in Texas which you can find out more here.\nDo you think this was a victory for Governor Abbott?\noutput:",

On Sunday, November 5th, at 2 a.m. local time, our clocks will be turned back by an hour, granting us an additional hour of sleep. This is part of the regular biannual time adjustment that has an impact on most, but not all, Americans.In the following year, on 2024, daylight saving time will commence again in March, causing us to move our clocks forward and lose one hour of sleep. The purpose behind gaining an hour in November, rather than losing one in the spring, is to make room for more daylight in the mornings. Conversely, when we \"spring forward\" in March, the intention is to extend daylight during the summer evenings. It is worth mentioning that in the Northern Hemisphere, the autumnal equinox occurred on September 23rd, signifying the commencement of the fall season. Daylight saving time is a biannual occurrence that impacts most Americans, whether they are ready for it or not.\nOn November 5th, our clocks are set backward by an hour, providing us with an additional hour of rest. This adjustment is designed to allow for more daylight in the mornings during the fall and winter seasons. However, it is important to note that not all Americans are affected by this time change, as there are some states and territories that do not observe daylight saving time.Looking ahead to 2024, daylight saving time will once again take place in March, resulting in us losing an hour of sleep. This shift is focused on extending daylight during the summer evenings, as we \"spring forward\" our clocks. It is interesting to consider the timing of these time adjustments in relation to the autumnal equinox, which occurred on September 23rd in the Northern Hemisphere, marking the beginning of the fall season. As we approach daylight saving time, it is important for individuals to be aware of these changes and adjust their schedules accordingly to minimize any disruptions in their daily routines.\nSource:\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/10/02/daylight-saving-time-2023/70971436007/\noutput:",

A few reports also came from North Dakota and as far south as Omaha, Nebraska.\nUnlike past Earthbound CMEs that hit early this year and were heavily reported about, this one had slower solar wind speeds and wasn't projected to be as strong. The overall weak nature of this CME caused many Aurora hunters who watch the charts to signal the arrival of the CME hitting Earth to miss it since the spike we are so used to seeing was not present in this setup.\nInstead, the only other hints that the Northern Lights might be present this time around and the arrival of the CME was a gap in the data from the satellites as the CME hit them, an ever so subtle increase in the solar winds, and a gradual decrease in the Bz values (Negative Bz), which means the solar energy is aligning with Earth's magnetic field favoring better odds the lights can be seen further south in the United States. Something Charlie Bourdo caught hours before the event unfolded Friday night!\nDo you want to learn more about the Northern Lights and how to forecast them better?

McMaster testified in front of Congress over concerns posed by the Chinese government and their rising influence in global markets.\nOne of which is food security, a point brought up recently by South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson who said, “Food security is national security,\" he said. \"And I think we've seen that Russia was able to exercise undue influence over Europe because they supplied them [with] so much natural gas. And similarly, if China has control over food supplies in South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, even in North America, that can give them more power,more coercive power, over the globe.\"\nLawmakers and authorities are also showing concern as China increases their foothold in Michigan one farm at a time.\nMichigan lawmakers Tom Kundse, R-Clare, and Matt Hall Richland, have introduced legislation that would make it illegal for “certain foreign ownership of certain real estate,” thereby making it harder for Chinese owned companies to buy Michigan farmland.\nNow, many experts believe that China owning land isn’t exactly a threat to U.S. security as evidenced by Michigan State agricultural economist William Knudsen saying, “If I was worried about foreign ownership of the food supply I would not focus on land,” he said. “I’m focused on things like owning seed companies, major grain shippers and handlers because that’s where the choke points are in the agri-food supply chain.”\nBut there are other concerns with foreign land buyers.\nOne is the price of land. It is hard for Michigan farmers to compete with foreign buyers, which makes it harder for farmers to increase their farm size as well as deterring young farmers from starting out.\nCurrently, Michigan has 1.4 million acres of foreign held farmland, per the USDA. Most of this is held by German and Italian entities. Michigan ranks sixth in the country in foreign held farmland.\nRight now, Chinese owned companies own 44,000 in the Midwest and it is increasing each year.\nRecently, China has been making a number of investments in the state of Michigan, including a hotly contested battery factory in Green Charter Township.\noutput:",

On March 5, 2023, Dexter Wade of Jackson, Mississippi, went missing after leaving his residence. Ten days later, his concerned mother, Bettersen Wade, reported his mysterious absence to the local police.\nIt has been unearthed that a mere hour after his departure that day, an off-duty corporal from the Jackson Police Department fatally hit Dexter while he was crossing Interstate 55 in Jackson. The highway, which is in close proximity to Bettersen Wade's residence, is a busy thoroughfare with six lanes.\nWhile a post-mortem revealed that Dexter had sustained major head injuries and had traces of PCP and methamphetamine in his system, he wasn't carrying any identification. However, a prescription bottle discovered in his pocket led Hinds County investigator, LaGrand Elliot, to identify the victim as Dexter Wade. By March 9, after confirming Dexter's identity, Elliot claims to have handed over the information to the Jackson Police Department’s accident investigation unit for them to break the tragic news to his next of kin, Bettersen.\nContrary to expectations, Bettersen received no communication about her son's tragic fate. Despite her consistent efforts and numerous inquiries to the Jackson Police Department, she was continuously informed that there were no updates on Dexter.\nFurther adding to the tragedy, on July 14, 2023, without informing the family, the county interred Dexter in an anonymous pauper’s grave. It wasn't until August 24, 2023, more than five months after Dexter's disappearance, that Bettersen was finally contacted by a new investigator, informing her that an officer would visit her.\nFeeling the weight of the looming news, Bettersen stated to NBC, \"When she said that, I felt in my heart he was gone.

Walter handed down the sentence, along with a restitution order requiring Nikogosyan to pay back the full $3 million.\nNikogosyan, 45, had previously pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to launder money on March 27, admitting his role in the operation.\nThe conspiracy began in 2020 and continued until December of the same year. Nikogosyan played a pivotal role in the money laundering operation, which revolved around fraudulent unemployment claims, prosecutors said.\nHis co-conspirators applied for UI benefits in the names of unsuspecting individuals and utilized debit cards issued by a major bank to withdraw the fraudulently obtained funds.\nAs a result, Nikogosyan was designated to receive the cash proceeds generated from this fraudulent scheme.\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic leading to Congress expanding the amounts, duration, and eligibility for UI benefits in 2020, the Employment Development Department in California administered the program.\nNikogosyan was well aware that the funds he was handling constituted the proceeds of this fraudulent activity, and he took deliberate steps to obscure their source, ownership, and location, prosecutors said.\nTo achieve this, Nikogosyan used assumed names, including those associated with shell companies, to have the illicitly obtained funds deposited.\nSubsequently, he transferred these funds abroad and invested in gold, creating an added layer of complexity to conceal the origin of the funds.\nThroughout the course of the conspiracy, Nikogosyan laundered a minimum of $3 million in fraudulently obtained proceeds, according to prosecutors.\nMuch of this money was delivered to him in cash by his co-conspirators. In a pivotal development, law enforcement agents seized $194,497 in cash from Nikogosyan's residence in December 2020. This money was identified as proceeds from the fraudulent scheme, further substantiating his involvement.\noutput:",

According to a document received by Military Times, the medal's eligibility has been renewed retroactive to January 1 and will continue through December 31, 2024.\nU.S. Central Command requested the adjustment, according to Defense Department spokesman Nicole Schwegman, \"due to Iraq no longer being classified as a combat mission.\"\nAlthough the award was created in 2016 to recognize service in either Iraq or Syria, the requirements for the medal were revised in 2017 to restrict eligibility to only those who have served in Syria.\nThere has been a rise in hostile actions against American troops in the Middle East, notwithstanding Schwegman's assertion that the reinstatement of the award for troops in Iraq was not prompted by the recent intensification of drone operations there.\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin briefed senators on Capitol Hill this morning on the Pentagon's plans to fight such actions and the escalating tensions in the region.\n\"Our personnel have been under frequent attack in recent days by Iranian-backed paramilitary groups. \"These assaults have got to stop,\" he said. U.S. forces, acting on the president's orders, have carried out targeted self-defense strikes against Iranian IRGC and allied targets in eastern Syria. We will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to safeguard our people if Iranian-backed militants continue to attack U.S. forces.\nAs combat escalates between Israel and the Islamist group Hamas, the United States is sending more troops and resources to the Middle East, where they will join the roughly 2,500 already stationed in Iraq and the 900 already stationed in Syria.\nEdited by Newsbreak Contributor Denys Shybinskiy\noutput:",
