        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nIt's the kind of thing you see in movies, like Robert Redford's role in \"All Is Lost\" or Ang Lee's \"Life of Pi.\" But, in real life, it's hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days, weeks, if not months and somehow living to talk about it. Miracles do happen, though, and not just in Hollywood. We're not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the U.S. Coast Guard. Much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they'd brought aboard, if any. In order to survive, they can't bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city, town or boat -- but instead must rely on ingenuity, resourcefulness and luck. It's hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly, with a sailor dying at sea, except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues. Such happy endings do occur -- given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says, a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts. Below are a few recent examples:. Louis Jordan says that he set off on his 35-foot sailboat from South Carolina in late January. He headed into the Gulf Stream looking for a good spot to catch fish. And then everything -- his boat, his life -- turned upside down. Rescued man says he is 'utterly thankful' Not only did his boat capsize, but its mast broke, Jordan said. And so, too, did his shoulder. He bought time by rationing water, then collecting fresh water in a bucket. As to food, Jordan says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish. And he rigged a makeshift mast and sail. But, Jordan said, \"It took so long. It moved so slowly.\" His sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a German-flagged container ship, the Houston Express, spotted Jordan about 200 miles off the North Carolina coast on Thursday. After their reunion, his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads. \"I thought I lost you.\" Jose Salvador Alvarenga says his journey began in Paredon Viejo, a port on Mexico's Pacific coast, in late 2012. The exact date is up for debate -- he says he set off in December, locals say it was November. But what's not in doubt is that, after he left, he disappeared. Until January 2013. That's when Alvarenga interacted with humans once again, thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the Marshall Islands. Castaway recounts how he survived over a year adrift in Pacific. What was supposed to be a one-day trip, he says, turned into an arduous odyssey across the Pacific Ocean, one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive. His nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course. Then a storm hit causing their boat, which was about three people long and one wide, to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and GPS systems. Four weeks in, Alvarenga said his partner -- 23-year-old Ezequiel Cordova, according to the boat's owner -- died because he refused to eat raw birds. The days, weeks and months ran together after that. Alvarenga says he drank rainwater and, when there wasn't any available, his own urine. He ate sea turtles. Then, after 13 or 14 months adrift, he and his small, heavily damaged boat arrived on the Ebon Atoll, about a 22-hour boat ride from the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro. The atoll has one phone line, no Internet service and a few residents, two of whom Alvarenga spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods. The El Salvador native told CNN that his faith in God helped him survive. \"I thought, 'I am going to get out,\" he said. \"Get out, get out, get out.\" Some in their late 60s might relax in their retirement, reining it in a few notches as life slows down. And if you live in Hawaii, there's even more reason to take it easy. The thing is: Ron Ingraham isn't one of those people. He's a fisherman. The sea is both his life and livelihood, his son, Zakary, told CNN. And he's tough, with his son jokingly comparing him to Rambo. Still, even the hardiest fishermen would have been tested by what Ron Ingraham went through after setting off around last Thanksgiving solo from the Hawaiian island of Molokai. Son vindicated as father rescued after 12 days at sea. After bad weather hit, Ron Ingraham told CNN affiliate KHNL/KGMB that his 25-foot sailboat went \"backwards all night long.\" At one point, a huge wave struck -- pushing his mast into the water and him as well. The 67-year-old used a rope to pull himself back in. But his boat couldn't be rescued so easily, leaving him at the mercy of the current. A distress call went out, prompting a search that would cover 12,000 square miles. When a Coast Guard official told him the search was being called off December 1, Zakary Ingraham responded, \"I don't feel like he's dead. I don't feel it.\" He was right. Twelve days after that first distress call, Ron Ingraham was picked up about 64 miles (103 kilometers) south of Honolulu \"weak, hungry and dehydrated\" and -- most importantly -- alive. The veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him. In February 2012, two friends asked 18-year-old Adrian Vasquez whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition. He said yes, and the three set off from the Panama town of San Carlos on a small boat, Vasquez's mother, Nilsa de la Cruz, recalled. Things started out well, by all accounts. The three caught plenty of fish. Then, their boat's engine died without warning. And, with no tools and scant navigational experience, the trio didn't know what to do, according to Vasquez's mother. Mother calls Panama teen's return 'a miracle' Vazquez ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat, the Fifty Cents, further and further from the coast and into the Pacific Ocean. Somewhere along the way, his two companions died. It's not clear exactly how, with Ecuadorian Rear. Adm. Freddy Garcia Calle saying Vasquez threw their bodies into the sea \"because they had become badly decomposed.\" Some 26 days after and nearly 600 miles away from where the journey began, fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the Galapagos Islands. The Ecuadorian navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor, who'd lost 20 pounds and showed \"severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition,\" according to Calle. He returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him, but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal. \"For us, this is an opportunity to get closer as a family,\" his mother said by phone, \"to be more understanding and loving.\" Sometimes one doesn't have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled. Sometimes people don't have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end. For proof, look no further than Hiromitsu Shinkawa. 60-year-old man waves red flag to alert rescuers. He was at home on March 11, 2011, when a massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck 231 miles northeast of Tokyo. A devastating tsunami followed, its 30-foot waves ravaging cities and towns and damaging several nuclear reactors. By the time it had run the course, nearly 16,000 people were dead. It's a miracle Shinkawa wasn't one of them. Shortly after the quake, he and his wife had gone to collect some belongings when the tsunami slammed their hometown of Minamisoma. His home was one of the tens of thousands destroyed by the the huge, powerful tsunami wave. \"I was saved by holding onto the roof,\" the 60-year-old said, according to Kyodo News Agency. \"But my wife was swept away.' More than two days later, video showed Shinkawa barely visible amid heaps of splintered wood, shattered homes and other debris floating more than nine miles (15 kilometers) out to sea. He was waving a self-made red flag. After being spotted by crew aboard a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer and picked up in a smaller rescue boat, he took a drink offered to him and burst into tears, Kyodo reported. Shinkawa told his rescuers, \"I thought today was the last day of my life.\"\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "This article tells the stories of three individuals who survived being stranded at sea for extended periods. Louis Jordan set off from South Carolina in January 2023 and was rescued after his boat capsized and his mast broke, leaving him stranded for an unknown length of time. Jose Salvador Alvarenga left from Mexico in late 2012 and was found on a remote atoll in the Marshall Islands over a year later. Ron Ingraham, a fisherman from Hawaii, was lost at sea for 12 days after his boat was damaged in bad weather. Adrian Vasquez, an 18-year-old from Panama, survived 26 days at sea after his boat's engine died and his companions died during the journey. Hiromitsu Shinkawa was saved from the 2011 tsunami in Japan by holding onto the roof of his home, which was later carried out to sea. All five individuals relied on their resourcefulness and luck to survive their ordeals.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 173 words:\nWhen Hong Kong police answered a call in the early hours of a Saturday morning last November, they encountered a grisly scene and an alleged crime that shocked the city. One woman was lying on the floor with cuts to her neck and buttocks. Another was stuffed inside a suitcase on the balcony. A former banker, 29-year-old Briton Rurik Jutting, was charged with two counts of murder. On Thursday, a court hearing that was to determine whether there was enough evidence to proceed to trial was adjourned until May. Here's what we know so far about the victims and their alleged attacker. Jutting allegedly lived at the murder scene, an upmarket apartment in the middle of Wan Chai, an inner-city suburb that's home to an eclectic mix of late-night bars, residential tower blocks and local markets selling groceries and assorted cheap goods. In the early hours of Saturday morning, November 1, police say Jutting called them to the apartment.  There they found a woman lying on the blood-splattered floor, later identified as 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih. During a search of the apartment, officers uncovered another body hidden in a suitcase on the balcony. It's alleged 25-year-old Sumarti Ningsih was killed on October 27, five days before her body was found. Sumarti Ningsih was from Cilacap, in Central Java, and was the mother of a five-year-old girl. In a statement, her cousin, Jumiati, described her as  \"just an ordinary woman from Indonesia\" who, like many others, was \"forced to work abroad to feed her poor family and make her dream comes (sic) true.\" \"She wanted to work as professional so she can earn money and dignity for her family,\" Jumiati wrote. \"She is good girl and did not deserve this treatment.\" According to the Asian Migrant Coordinating Body, Ningsih was visiting Hong Kong as a tourist and had been due to fly back to Jakarta the day after her body was found. Last year, her grieving father, Ahmad Khaliman, told Agence France-Presse that his daughter had worked in Hong Kong as a domestic helper between 2011 and 2013. She'd since returned on two occasions, Khaliman said. He said the family had been shocked by her murder, and called for the perpetrator to be executed. \"If not, I cannot accept it. He has already taken my daughter's life, so he has to pay with his life,\" he told CNN affiliate Trans7. Seneng Mujiasih had more recently worked as a domestic worker in Hong Kong but had overstayed her visa, according to the Asian Migrant Co-ordinating Body. Also known as Jesse Lorena, Mujiasih was from the city of Muna in Sulawesi province, in southeast Indonesia. Other than that, few details are known about her life and why she stayed on in Hong Kong. After news of their death spread, fellow domestic workers held a vigil in Hong Kong's Victoria Park. Around 200 people gathered to sing and pray, and lay flowers besides photos of the two women. The victims' bodies were buried after being repatriated to Indonesia in November. Before being taken into custody, Rurik Jutting lived in the upmarket J Residence in Wan Chai.  He was detained at the scene, where police found the bodies of two women and seized a knife during a search of the premises. It's unclear when Jutting left his job as a trader at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch; a BoA spokesman would only confirm that a man of the same name had worked there in the past. Jutting's profile on LinkedIn said he haad been employed at the bank's structured equity finance and trading division in Hong Kong since July 2013. Before that, he worked in the same unit in London for three years. According to the profile, Jutting previously worked in capital markets for the British bank Barclays and studied history and law at the prestigious University of Cambridge, between 2004 and 2008. As part of the trial process, tests were conducted to determined if Jutting was psychologically fit to enter a plea. He was. The case was then adjourned to allow for more than 200 pieces of forensic and DNA evidence to be analyzed.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 196 words:\nThe outlines of a nuclear deal with Iran are in place. Unfortunately, it seems like too many in President Barack Obama's administration have forgotten that the only reason this terrorist-supporting state came to the negotiating table in the first place was because of tough sanctions imposed by the U.S. Congress. Indeed, the reality is that President Obama is giving up enormous leverage in his nuclear deal with Iran -- and I worry we will lose it for good. Bleeding money, and faced with falling oil prices, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei gave his government rare permission to bargain with the \"Great Satan\" -- the United States. But just as U.S. and European sanctions were forcing Iran to the nuclear crossroads, President Obama has given Tehran an easy exit. For Khamenei, the \"framework\" announced last week looks like a win-win: He gets to keep his nuclear infrastructure, and in return gets billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Congress offered a better strategy when the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, and I introduced a bill to hit Tehran with its toughest sanctions yet. Unfortunately, this bill -- which passed the House in a 400-20 vote -- was blocked in the Senate last year, despite the fact that it would have sharpened the Ayatollah's choice: Dismantle your nuclear weapons program or see your economy collapse. President Obama once had a tougher line, when in 2012 he said: \"The deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program. It's very straightforward.\" But the framework announced last week does nothing of the sort. Negotiated between Iran and the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, the framework concedes that Iran can maintain \"a mutually defined enrichment program,\" operate thousands of centrifuges, and continue its research and development of nuclear technologies. The deal currently on the table would hand Tehran billions of previously sanctioned funds, filling the coffers of the world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism, with strongholds in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon. Meanwhile, the strictest restrictions on Iran's enrichment will expire in only 10 years, despite the President receiving a letter from 367 Members of Congress -- both Democrats and Republicans -- in which we insisted that \"verifiable constraints on Iran's nuclear program must last for decades.\" The President admitted as much when he conceded that \"in year 13, 14, 15, they have advanced centrifuges that enrich uranium fairly rapidly, and at that point the breakout times would have shrunk almost down to zero.\" But as bad as these concessions are, the most concerning aspect of the April 2 deal is that it lacks tough safeguards to stop Iran from cheating. The key question is this: Will the inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency be allowed to inspect these military sites without warning? Because if the IAEA cannot conduct \"anytime, anywhere\" inspections, Iran will be able to \"sneak out\" to a bomb. It has been done before. Remember, in 1994, when President Bill Clinton told us he had struck a deal with North Korea that would \"make the United States, the Korean Peninsula, and the world safer\"? President Clinton sounded a little too much like the current Secretary of State John Kerry, when he promised that the North Korea agreement \"does not rely on trust\" and that \"compliance will be certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\" Twelve years after these assurances, North Korea detonated its first nuclear bomb. Iran could easily do the same. The best predictor of its future behavior is its past behavior -- between 2004 and 2009, the Iranian government built a huge centrifuge facility named Fordo under a mountain deep in the Iranian desert. Luckily for the world, Western intelligence agencies discovered Tehran's deception. But we cannot rely on such luck in the future, particularly when Iran still hasn't come clean about its history of secret weapons development and is still dodging basic questions from the IAEA. Let's not forget the other things Iran has been doing while its diplomats have been bargaining with the U.S. and its partners. While Iran was showing its friendly new face to the world, it has simultaneously been helping Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad kill his own people, training and funding the terrorist group Hezbollah, which aims to annihilate Israel, and supporting the Houthis, who started a civil war and overthrew the government in Yemen -- one of America's more reliable counterterrorism partners in the region. If President Obama is going to hand over billions of dollars to a regime that behaves like this, run by a man who publicly declares: \"Death to America,\" it has to be a better deal. The framework we have before us keeps Iran's nuclear door well and truly open.\n\noutput:",

However, the deal allows Iran to keep its nuclear infrastructure and receive billions of dollars in sanctions relief. A bill passed in the House in 2015, which aimed to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, was blocked in the Senate. The deal lacks sufficient safeguards to prevent Iran from cheating and does not require \"anytime, anywhere\" inspections of military sites. Iran's past behavior, such as building a secret centrifuge facility named Fordo, raises concerns about its future intentions. Additionally, Iran continues to support terrorism and destabilize the Middle East through its actions in Syria, Hezbollah, and Yemen. Critics argue that handing over billions of dollars to a regime with such behavior is not a good deal.",

Walker told CNN the man was transported to Presbyterian Hospital, but CNN affiliates reported he was being treated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He suffered eye problems, dehydration, malnutrition and a cut to the back that has raised infection concerns, the lieutenant told reporters. \"This kid's obviously a fighter,\" Walker said during a Saturday news conference. \"It's just unbelievable how we found him out there last night. To see that kid laying there, it's heartbreaking to see another human, especially a mother, can treat someone like that.\" Officials at Philadelphia's School of the Future, which the man attends, became concerned when he didn't show up for classes and tried to contact his mother but eventually reached an aunt, CNN affiliate WPVI reported. When police tracked down the mother, she told them her son was with her, Walker said. \"She indicated to both family members and the police officers that the child was with her down with her boyfriend in Maryland,\" he said. The boyfriend was not aware of what happened, Walker told CNN affiliate KYW-TV. The mother now stands charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, reckless endangerment of another person, neglect of a care-dependent person, unlawful restraint, kidnapping and false imprisonment, the station reported. Walker told reporters she bore \"clear criminal liability in this case.\" Maryland police took her into custody on Sunday, and she will face the charges in Philadelphia following an extradition hearing, WPVI reported. There was no reason for the man to suffer, Walker told philly.com, because the mother had sisters willing to take care of him. Two of his aunts, who have tried to obtain guardianship of him, were staying with him at the hospital, police told the website.

For more than four days, police say, the quadriplegic man, who also suffers from cerebral palsy, was left lying in the woods of Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park.

The victim -- Ron Lane, whom officials said was a longtime employee and the school's print shop operator -- was white, as is the suspect. Lane's relatives said he was gay, CNN affiliate WNCN reported. The suspect, Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, worked with Lane as part of a work-study program, but was let go from the program in early March due to poor attendance, college President Kay Albertson said Tuesday. On Monday, Stancil walked into the print shop on the third floor of a campus building, aimed a pistol-grip shotgun and fired once, killing Lane, according to Sutton. Stancil has tattoos on his face. Sutton said investigators are looking into whether he is part of a white supremacist gang. He has no previous criminal record, authorities said. Sutton said Stancil fled on a motorcycle after the shooting and ultimately abandoned it in a highway median. Then, Stancil continued on to Daytona, Florida, but authorities don't know how he traveled, Sutton said. He was arrested just after 1 a.m. Tuesday, after he was found sleeping on a beach, about 550 miles (885 kilometers) from Goldsboro. Volusia County Beach Patrol had approached him for violating the city's ordinance against sleeping on the beach. He had a knife, police said. He was taken into custody without incident.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nIt's not easy being the Pope. Not only does he shepherd nearly 1 billion Catholic souls, he also leads a small but morally significant state with envoys and interests in nearly every country. As scholars like to say, the Vatican has walked the line between spiritual and worldly concerns for centuries. Sometimes, as when St. John Paul II stood up to Communist Poland, the church's moral and political clout have combined to pack a powerful punch. At other times, popes have to make a hard choice: Adopt the sharp tongue of a prophet or the discretion of a diplomat? This Sunday in Rome, Pope Francis faced just such a dilemma. First, the back story:. One hundred years ago, more than 1 million Armenians (some estimates run as high as 1.5 million) died at the hand of the Turks. Many of the victims were part of a branch of Christianity closely aligned with Catholicism. A slew of  historians and at least 20 countries call the killings a \"genocide.\" (A U.S. resolution to do the same has languished in Congress.) Turkish officials disagree, arguing that the deaths, while unfortunate, were part of a long-running war that witnessed casualties on all sides. For their part, previous popes had finessed the genocide question. John Paul II used the \"g\" word in 2001, but didn't dare speak it out loud. Instead, it was tucked into a document signed by the former pontiff and the head of the Armenian church, after they had celebrated Mass together. Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI called the killings \"a great evil\" and \"terrible persecution\" in a speech 2006, but avoided labeling them genocide. (Benedict found other ways to tick off the Turks, initially opposing their entry into the European Union.) As Pope Francis prepared to celebrate a special Mass Sunday to commemorate a century since the slaughter,  Vatican watchers were divided about whether he would use the word \"genocide.\" He did, but in a roundabout way, by quoting John Paul's document. \"In the past century, our human family has lived through three massive and unprecedented tragedies,\" Francis said. \"The first, which is widely considered 'the first genocide of the 20th century,' struck your own Armenian people.\" The middle phrase comes directly from the document issued 14 years ago by John Paul. In citing his predecessor, Francis highlighted one of the Vatican's chiefest concerns, especially on matters of moral import: continuity. Whether holding the line against artificial birth control, declining to ordain female priests or dealing with diplomatic tensions, it sometimes seems as if the church considers inconsistency the most unforgivable of sins. \"The Vatican and the papacy love continuity,\" said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a Vatican analyst for National Catholic Reporter. If Francis had not called the Armenian killings a genocide, particularly at such a high-profile event -- the audience included Armenia's President -- it might have been interpreted as a change in church policy, Reese said. At the same time, Francis didn't want to anger the Turks more than necessary, especially since they have become a key ally against the persecution of Christians by ISIS in the Middle East, which the Pope alluded to in his speech on Sunday. \"The fact that he quoted John Paul is a sign that he's downplaying it,\" Reese said of the Armenian murders. \"He's telling people: There's nothing new here.\" New or not, Turkey was not happy. The nation recalled its Vatican ambassador for \"consultations\" just hours after Francis' comments, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. Turkey also promptly summoned his counterpart, the Vatican's ambassador, for a meeting, Turkish state broadcaster TRT reported. In a tweet Sunday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called the Pope's use of the word \"unacceptable\" and \"out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis.\" \"Religious authorities are not places through which hatred and animosity are fueled by unfounded allegations,\" the tweet reads. \"Hatred\" and \"animosity\" are not words often used to describe Pope Francis. Because he often shines a sympathetic face on the world, emphasizing mercy over judgment, it's easy to miss the bluntness Francis brings to the bully pulpit. On matters of doctrine and diplomacy, he may be carrying on Catholic traditions, but in his willingness to engage in geopolitics and the tone that engagement often takes, this pope is decidedly different. He has helped broker a backroom detente between the United States and Cuba, and invited Israeli and Palestinian leaders for an unprecedented prayer service at the Vatican (after annoying some Israelis with an impromptu prayer at the wall that separates the West Bank from Jerusalem.) But Francis has also suggested that force may be justified to stop ISIS' slaughter of Christians, warned of the \"Mexicanization\" of Argentina and said that satirists who insult religion should expect a retaliatory punch. On Monday, the Pope addressed a roomful of priests at morning Mass. He must have heard the hubbub about his \"genocide\" remark, but he encouraged his charges to speak frankly, without fear, and to bear the courage of their convictions, just as the early apostles had. \"We cannot keep silent about what we have seen and heard,\" Francis said. CNN's Gul Tuysuz  and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The Pope, as the spiritual leader of nearly 1 billion Catholics and the head of the small but influential Vatican state, often faces the challenge of balancing spiritual and worldly concerns. This past Sunday, Pope Francis had to decide whether to use a strong moral stance or diplomatic discretion regarding the Armenian genocide centenary. Previous popes had avoided labeling the 1915 killings of up to 1.5 million Armenians as genocide, but Francis quoted John Paul II's description of it as the \"first genocide of the 20th century\" during a Mass commemorating the event. Turkey, which disputes the genocide label, recalled its ambassador for consultations and summoned the Vatican's ambassador for a meeting in response. The Pope's use of the term was described as \"unacceptable\" and \"out of touch with historical facts and legal basis\" by Turkey's Foreign Minister. Despite the diplomatic tension, Francis emphasized the importance of speaking frankly and bearing the courage of one's convictions.",

Devastating winds lashed cars and homes. The storm system also brought destructive flooding that washed away houses and brought down trees onto streets and buildings. The emergency services have been slammed with 13,000 calls for help due to flooding and have carried out 144 rescue tasks. The powerful storm has already claimed four lives, according to New South Wales Police. The dangerous conditions have prompted the police department to issue pleas on social media for people to not attempt driving through flooded areas. The heavy flooding prompted school and college closures and disruptions to public transportation. The adverse weather was caused by an intense low pressure system, said Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. The strongest wind gusts peaked at 135 km/h (85 mph) and it was estimated that about 200 millimeters (7.87 inches) of rainfall fell in the area on Tuesday. Transport NSW, which provides public transportation throughout the New South Wales area, issued a warning that many public services across the region have been disrupted because of the weather. It also posted a video on its Facebook page showing CCTV footage of a flood waters rising in a train station. Samantha Mancuso was driving in her neighborhood of Liverpool, a suburb in Sydney on Wednesday, when she noticed gallons of water pouring into the streets.

Her feet were sore from wearing 4.5-inch heels. Still, they walked to Boylston Street to watch the runners. \"We were so in love and happy together,\" she told a federal jury Wednesday. It was the second day the Boston jury heard a procession of heartbreaking loss -- the survivors and families of those killed when twin bombs planted by the pair of brothers named Tsarnaev exploded near the finish line. The jury must decide whether bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. Haslet-Davis and Davis, who had just returned from a tour in Afghanistan with the Air Force, were steps away from the explosion near the Forum restaurant. She recalled the force of the blast that killed three people and injured over 200 that April day in 2013. She knew right away it was a terrorist attack. Screams and heavy smoke filled the air. She couldn't hear her own screams. She thought she was dead. When her husband, who also was injured, lifted her leg, he too let out a scream. She said she thought he was in shock. She rolled over onto her stomach and crawled over broken glass, shredding her arms. She dragged herself to the Forum. \"I saw all five of my toes, but I saw a lot of blood,\" she said. \"I didn't see my ankle.\" A ballroom dancer, Haslet-Davis' left leg would later be amputated below the knee. Inside the Forum, Haslet-Davis begged for whiskey. \"I just wanted the pain to go away. I only begged for the whiskey when I thought I was going to die.\" When someone removed Adam's shoe, an artery was spurting blood. His face got whiter and whiter, she said. His eye rolled back. She thought he was dead. At a hospital, she called her parents on her cellphone. She told them she was in a terrorist attack. \"I don't think I have a left foot anymore,\" she told her father. \"I'm in really bad shape and I really need to talk to you because this might be it.\" Her father told her he was driving and it was illegal to pull over. \"I don't care if it's illegal. I need to talk to you because these might be our last words. I said I was in a terrorist attack at the Boston Marathon and Adam is dead and this might be it for me.\" Haslet-Davis told the jury that, at the Forum, her husband kept telling her he was sorry. \"That was all he could say. That he loved me. He was so sorry.\" Her husband, she said, has since \"bravely admitted himself into a mental facility at the VA hospital.\" After her testimony, Haslet-Davis walked slowly off the stand. She appeared to glare at Tsarnaev, who did not look at her. Earlier this week, prosecutors showed jurors an image of Tsarnaev taken when he was in a holding cell. It was dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a gesture that Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said showed a young man who was \"unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged.\" On Wednesday, Tsarnaev's lawyer, Miriam Conrad, sought to discredit the use of the image. She suggested the gesture had been presented to the jury out of context. On cross-examination of a deputy U.S. marshal, Conrad showed the jury security footage from which the image was taken. In it, Tsarnaev is seen looking into the camera touching his hair. Moments before, he has two fingers up, forming what Conrad called a \"V sign,\" before raising his middle finger. Gary Olivera, a deputy U.S. Marshal for 14 years, admitted that the camera was encased in a reflective surface and Tsarnaev could have been using it as a mirror. \"A lot of times people do that to get our attention,\" Olivera said. Also Wednesday, Jinyan Zhao told the jury about her niece, Lingzi Lu, a \"beautiful nerd\" and graduate student at Boston University who was killed in the bombing. Lingzi Lu was originally from China but was buried in Boston. \"How she died, and why she died, it just felt like she is part of Boston, part of city,\" her aunt said. \"The thinking is she should just be here.\" The family, Zhao said, put a music box and some books in her casket. Her mother put a bracelet on her wrist and touched her hand. Later, her mother described her beautiful hand. Zhao recalled what Lu's mother said to her: \" 'No matter what I don't want to believe it is her hand.' \" The brother and stepfather of Sean Collier also took the stand Wednesday. Collier was the MIT police officer who was shot in his patrol car, another victim of the Tsarnaev brothers as they tried to evade capture. Sean Collier always wanted to be a cop, said his brother. He was a child who viewed life in terms of right and wrong. Either you did it or you didn't. \"We thought it was typical little boy stuff, but he never grew out of it,\" Andrew Collier told the jury. \"Sean was always the one to spill the beans,\" said Joe Rodgers, 59, who married Collier's mother, Kelly, in 1993. \"He was a cop from an early age.\" On a Thursday night in April 2013, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Officer Sean Collier lay bleeding in his patrol car after being ambushed and shot in the head. His car door was open, and his foot was lodged between the gas and brake pedals. The officer who found Collier testified at trial that he had wounds to the temple, neck and head. He was bleeding out as officers tried to revive him. Collier would become the fourth victim of the Tsarnaev brothers. The night still feels like a dream for Rodgers. \"He had a hole in the middle of his head,\" Rodgers said. \"He was shot to pieces. He was just laying there. My wife was touching him, and his blood was coming up in her hands.\" Prosecution shows what it calls Tsarnaev's defiant message to U.S. Prosecutors said the brothers killed Collier because they wanted his gun. But their efforts to take it were thwarted by a safety holster. Tamerlan, 26, was killed in a chase and gunbattle with police that began with reports of an \"officer down\" at MIT. Less than two weeks after Tsarneav was found guilty on every count, the jury deciding his punishment is hearing about the lasting impact of his deeds. Earlier, MIT Police Chief John DiFava told the jury that he hired Collier, who fit in \"perfectly\" because of his policing style and engaging personality. The MIT police, who are designated as special officers by the Massachusetts State Police, patrol the sprawling campus in Cambridge. \"The atmosphere of the department changed since April 18, 2013,\" he said. \"There is sadness and a sense of loss. I think that it will be there for as long as that generation of officers remains. It was remarkable the amount of support we got from the community, but Sean's death hangs like a weight.\" DiFava has come to question whether he wants to continue on the force. \"Policing is the only thing I've done in my life, and I've always tried to be good at what I do,\" he said. \"I lost one of my own. I have children at home and I've always thought I would have been very, very proud for them to wear the uniform. Now I'm not so sure.\" Rodgers said it took his wife, Kelly, months to gain the strength to climb out of bed after losing her son. Saturday was the second anniversary of the bombing. She cried all weekend. \"She was very strong,\" he said. \"She was a happy person. She was a good mother. Since Sean's death, she's very scared of anything that might happen to any of the other children.\" Kelly became pregnant with Sean after losing a baby that lived for a day or two, Rodgers said. His birth lifted her out of depression. \"He was special,\" he said, adding that Sean is now buried alongside the baby. Rodgers said he still feels beat down two years later. \"There's something missing,\" he said. \"Thanksgiving and Christmas will never be the same.\" Collier's brother Andrew said, \"Even when we're having fun, there's always a cloud over us. I miss Sean. I miss everything about him.\" The prosecution is expected to rest Friday, according to an official with insight into the prosecutor's plans.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 190 words:\nAfter deliberating for more than 35 hours over parts of seven days, listening intently to the testimony of more than 130 witnesses and reviewing more than 400 pieces of evidence, the teary-eyed men and women of the jury exchanged embraces. Since late January, their work in the Massachusetts murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez had consumed their lives. It was nothing like \"Law & Order.\" The days were long and tedious. Now it was over. \"It's been an incredibly emotional toll on all of us,\" Lesa Strachan told CNN's Anderson Cooper Thursday in the first nationally televised interview with members of the jury. A day earlier, Strachan, the jury foreperson, announced the first-degree murder conviction in the 2013 shooting death of Hernandez's onetime friend Odin Lloyd. Strachan said she was struck by the viciousness of multiple gunshots. \"You shot him once but you kept going and you shot him six times. There's no need for that and there's no need to use a gun. Period.\" Before the trial, at least one juror -- Rosalie Oliver -- hadn't heard of the 25-year-old defendant who has now gone from a $40 million pro-football contract to a term of life without parole in a maximum-security prison. But Kelly Dorsey watches the Patriots every Sunday during the football season. She said so on her jury questionnaire. \"I knew of him as a football player, not a person,\" she said. It didn't affect her vote to convict, she said. It didn't matter that he was a football player, she said. Nor did it matter whether he actually pulled the trigger in the murder. \"To leave your friend on the ground, knowing that he's not there anymore -- he's either dead or he's going to die -- that's indifference,\" Dorsey said of Hernandez. \"He didn't need to pull the trigger.\" That word -- \"indifference\" -- was used multiple times by members of the jury. Jon Carlson said he was struck by testimony and video evidence that Hernandez and two co-defendants were sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying, drinking smoothies. Hernandez at times left his then-8-month-old daughter with the two men. That indifference \"surprised a lot of us,\" Carlson said. He stressed the fact that Hernandez played football for a living didn't influence the jury's decision. \"It doesn't matter how much money you have or how much money you make. We're all people, and we're all equal, and we all deserve the same fair trial, and that's what we wanted to make sure we gave him,\" Carlson said. Lloyd was seen June 17, 2013, around 2:30 a.m. with Hernandez and Hernandez's friends, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, in a rented silver Nissan Altima. Later that day, a jogger found his body. He had been shot six times, according to prosecutors. Wallace and Ortiz, who were also charged with murder, have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. What's next for Aaron Hernandez? Rosalie Oliver -- the juror who hadn't heard of Hernandez before the trial -- said that, for her, the first shot was enough. \"There was no need for the other five,\" she said. \"One shot for me is cruelty.\" Oliver and other jurors said they were surprised to receive calls from friends congratulating them after the verdict. \"Who won?\" she asked \"Odin Lloyd didn't win. (His mother) didn't bring back her son. Did Mr. Hernandez win? No, because he's going to serve the rest of his life in jail and he's 25 years old. The worst part for me is: How about that little girl that's never going to see her father again?\" What prison life will be like for Aaron Hernandez. Oliver recalled making eye contact with Hernandez at one point during the months-long trial. \"He actually nodded to me one time,\" she said. \"You come in that room every day and you see this person and it's hard to come to that decision at the end because -- like three months with them -- it's almost like they're part of you. And then, all of a sudden now, you've got to make that decision to either put him away or let him go.\" The jurors declined to talk about the dynamics inside the jury room, choosing instead to keep the focus on the evidence presented during trial. They conveyed a sense of gravity about their task. \"You see, you know, 'Law & Order' and all these different TV shows and it's just nothing like that at all. It's just very serious,\" Carlson said. 5 things to know about the jury.\n\noutput:",

His work and his life, as he knew it then, came to a halt on January 19, 2012. That's when, according to Italy's state-run ANSA news agency, four armed men burst into the building where Lo Porto lived and abducted him along with colleague Bernd Muehlenbeck. Two years later, Lo Porto was dead -- killed accidentally by a U.S. drone strike, according to American authorities. The native of the Sicilian city of Palermo died along with a fellow al Qaeda hostage, American Warren Weinstein. That same counterterrorism operation in a border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan killed at least one al Qaeda leader, Ahmed Farouq, who was also a U.S. citizen. His family members, including his four brothers, called him Giancarlo. Lo Porto grew up in Sicily and then studied at London Metropolitan University, getting his undergraduate degree there in Peace and Conflict Studies in 2010, according to the school. A professor there remembers him as \"passionate, friendly (and) open-minded,\" according to an ANSA report. And the university, in a statement, described him as \"a popular student who was committed to helping others.\" \"We are tremendously proud of him and the humanitarian work he did,\" the school said. At the time he was taken captive, Lo Porto worked with the German aid organization Welthungerlife, a 53-year-old group dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty worldwide. Such work means going to places where the need is most -- places like Multan in Pakistan. That community was one of many in Pakistan devastated by major flooding in 2010, which covered about one-fifth of the country and left more than 1,500 people dead. These conditions are all too common in the South Asian nation, as evidenced by flooding one year later that forced upwards of 660,000 into refugee camps and killed more than 430 people, about a quarter of whom were children. \"He told me, 'I'm pleased to have returned to Asia and Pakistan, I love the people, culture and food in this part of the world,' \" said the London Metropolitan University professor. Specifically, Lo Porto was a project manager with Welthungerlife's clean water and sanitation program, working with 8 to 10 fellow international staffers and 100 to 200 locals starting in October 2011, according to Simone Pott, a spokeswoman for the aid group. Pott described Lo Porto as a lively, very positive man who made friends all over the world. Some of those friends in Italy, England and beyond pressed for Lo Porto's release after he was taken captive, urging Italy's government and newspaper editors to get his story out, ANSA reported. The same story said that al Qaeda (after first claiming he was being held) denied abducting Lo Porto, as did the Pakistani Taliban. Muehlenbeck, a German national, was freed last October, at which time he said that he and his colleague had been separated, according to ANSA. But Lo Porto never got the chance to savor freedom again, like his German counterpart. Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said his country's government \"carried out every effort possible to trace and try to return Giovanni to his loved ones.\" \"Unfortunately, the conclusion is now different (than we wanted) because of the tragic and fatal mistake of our American allies, which has been recognized by President Obama,\" Gentiloni said. \"The responsibility of his death and (that) of Warren Weinstein ... is that of the terrorists.\" On Thursday, after the U.S. government reported Lo Porto's death, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi expressed his \"deepest sorrow for the death of an Italian who dedicated his life to the service of others.\" Lo Porto's death left those at his former charity Welthungerlife speechless and confused, Pott said. And then there are his family members like his mother, who ANSA reports became \"another person\" after her son's kidnapping. \"Her only hope was to embrace Giovanni,\" a neighbor said.

Merely a private. 13/7/16. SA Australia,\" reads one inscription. \"HA Deanate, 148th Aero Squadron, USA. 150 Vermilyea Ave, New York City,\" another says. \"9th Batt Australians, G. Fitzhenry, Paddington, Sydney, N.S.W., 1916 July; Alistair Ross, Lismore, July,\" reads a third. They were World War I soldiers, four of almost 2,000, whose writings have recently been found underneath battlefields near Naours, France, about 120 miles north of Paris. Photographer Jeff Gusky, who has been chronicling details of the site, describes the inscriptions -- and the underground city in which they were found -- as \"breathtaking.\" \"This is a treasure trove,\" he said Monday night from his home in East Texas, where he works as an ER doctor. \"Even locally, no one realized what was there.\" Gusky, a National Geographic photographer, has chronicled the area in a portfolio he calls \"The Hidden World of WWI.\" The revelations of the underground city, which extends for miles in some directions, have come to light recently only because of a series of events, Gusky said. The underground city actually dates back centuries but was sealed up in the 18th century. It was rediscovered in the late 19th century. During World War I, soldiers would take refuge in the carved-out rooms and pathways. The front was sometimes mere miles away; the Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest in world history, was fought nearby in 1916. The land was privately owned for many years and generally off-limits to outsiders, said Gusky, but it changed hands in 2013. The rights to operate it were purchased by a consortium of villages that wanted to promote awareness of the area's history, he said. Researching the city is a painstaking task. For one thing, it's dark, so observers generally haven't realized what's in there until they've gone exploring. Moreover, the maze-like extensiveness of the site has made discovery a slow process. \"They go on and on and on. They're so elaborate in some places, there are maps carved into stone so the soldiers wouldn't get lost,\" he said. The graffiti looks like it was written yesterday, he added. Gusky has noted 1,821 names. About 40% are Australian, with most of the others identified as British. Fifty-five are Americans, and 662 have yet to be traced. For Gusky, the graffiti provides a human connection with men who lived a century ago. In many cases, they just wanted to be remembered, he said. \"Someone could be in this place one day and the next fighting at the front,\" he said. Leach, \"merely a private,\" was killed a month later in battle, Gusky observed. \"It could very well have been the last time he recorded his name as a living, breathing human being,\" he said. 7 things you didn't know about the man who started WWI.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nThere was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that Rolling Stone retracted on Sunday night -- a part of the story that was never disputed: The University of Virginia is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus. The school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it. The Virginia attorney general asked the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students. That includes how UVA officials handled the allegations in the discredited Rolling Stone article by a student the magazine called \"Jackie,\" especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out. The alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012, and Jackie told the university about it the next spring. She started telling her story very publicly, including at a \"take back the night\" rally. But Charlottesville police didn't hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014, in which Jackie claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face. When a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault, she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident. In both cases, police said Jackie refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case. But more women came forward to talk about their experiences -- women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as Jackie's. Rolling Stone's story opened up a conversation about the topic, and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims. Many women told CNN about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus. They'd call it a \"bad experience.\" Others told CNN that there were fraternities with reputations for being \"rapey\" and for using date-rape drugs. That some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman's outfit. And if a woman did report her rape, some women complained that the internal process didn't seem worth it if their abuser wouldn't be kicked out of school. Rolling Stone had a line in its original story: \"UVA's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998, 183 people have been expelled for honor-code violations such as cheating on exams. And yet paradoxically, not a single student at UVA has ever been expelled for sexual assault.\" After the article published, UVA admitted this and instituted a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward -- although that policy was never defined, so it's unclear what it means. When the story was deleted from Rolling Stone's website, that was lost. \"You lose a lot of other people's voices who were in that article,\" said Sarah Roderick, a survivor and UVA student, \"and a lot of good things that could have come about. Fixing problems with administration here and on our campus\" -- and, she added, across the nationo. Along with the O'Melveny & Myers investigation, there's also an open Title IX investigation into UVA by the U.S. Department of Education as a result of a civil suit. The attorney who filed the suit, James Marsh, told CNN that UVA medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he's representing, making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice. When the Columbia Journalism School's 12,000-plus-word critique is summed up, it really boils down to this: The mistake could have been avoided if the writer, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of Jackie who she claimed were with her that night. They'd later tell other media outlets, including CNN, that they remembered a very different story. Rolling Stone says their account would have been a red flag. And all three say they would have talked if they'd been called. Ryan Duffin, one of the trio, said he felt deceived by Jackie, but he also pointed out that Erdely's mistake in fact-checking was about one single incident, and the fallout has caused a much bigger issue to be lost. \"Had she gotten in direct contact with us, it probably wouldn't have been printed, at least in that way,\" he said. \"A lot of the article was still based in truth, but the focal point would have been different.\" It might have been less dramatic, but it would have probably focused on some of the other UVA students who shared much more common stories of acquaintance rape on campus. \"I think my problem with it was that this reporter wanted to sensationalize an experience that's not very common,\" Roderick said. \"... And I wonder if it would have been different if (it dealt) with someone with a less horrific story -- something that happens to more people. I think this discredits what a lot of survivors go through. Something this physically horrific is not what everyone goes through. Now it's like, 'If I wasn't assaulted by more than one man then my story is not as worthy of attention.' It's frustrating that this is how rape is portrayed on college campuses because this is not the norm.\" Before the report came out, Abraham Axler, the student body president, said that some good had come from the article because it forced UVA to institute new policies and to open up a conversation on a topic that needed to be discussed nationwide. But some survivors and advocates are afraid the retraction set back their progress. \"I do feel like there's a possibility people will be afraid to come forward. If you come forward and share your story, if you don't have the date right, every detail down, you'll think, 'I'm going to be accused of being a liar. It's easier for me to keep it to myself,'\" Roderick said. \"There are very serious and unresolved questions about the university's performance,\" said Steve Coll, dean of the Columbia School of Journalism. \"Rolling Stone teed that subject up. I wouldn't say that everything about Rolling Stone's treatment of that subject was perfect, but it certainly doesn't fall under the same category as their reporting about Jackie's narrative.\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 176 words:\nDanny Kahneman, my good friend and co-author who got a Nobel Prize in economics, once helped to run an experiment involving patients undergoing colonoscopies.  One group received a mildly pleasurable experience at the end of the procedure; the other group, which experienced the same type of colonoscopy, did not. It turns out that the group for whom things ended well had significantly more positive recollections of the whole affair from its beginning. The psychology of it is simple to understand: Happy endings matter. Even an unpleasant experience can lead to happy memories in hindsight if it ends well. So too with taxes. Let's just say that when it comes to taxes for the average American, \"stuff\" happens (keeping the colonoscopy metaphor running), paycheck to tax-reduced paycheck.  But recent statistics suggest that 8 out of 10 American taxpayers get a refund when they file their taxes, and the average amount is close to $3000. That pays for a lot of stuff. To make the good news even better, tax filing has gotten rather simple for most people, with various software and service providers offering to do the dreaded paperwork for free. No filing headaches and a check to boot. What's not to like? The fact of the matter is there is plenty not to like when it comes to the U.S. tax system. For example, the laws are biased against two-worker marriages; taxes go up when two relatively equal earners marry, as the rate brackets for couples are less than double that for single filers. Taxes are also overly complex and essentially optional for the truly rich, who make their wealth off of their existing wealth, the largely untaxed returns from capital, rather than by getting ordinary paychecks like most of us. But now is not the time to explain such serious matters; the people are too busy spending their refunds. The once dreaded Tax Day has become a happy spending spree for most Americans. This state of short-term bliss follows from some deep trends in our tax laws. In brief, the U.S. income tax system is increasingly a wage tax, with limited taxes on capital (what the rich have) and limited deductions for most of us.  For example, 3 out of 4 Americans using a standard deduction get no break for their charitable contributions. All of this has been hashed and rehashed by politicians, professors and pundits. But who has time for that? Let's go to our television sets and check out the commercials. One clever spot ran during the recent Super Bowl, suggesting that the Boston Tea Party -- a tax revolt -- could have been averted with free online filing, which the sponsor was eager to provide. Filling out 1040s was part of what made the income tax so odious for the masses for such a long time -- who doesn't remember our parents fretting over shoeboxes of receipts sometime in April, the cruelest month? Now as Tax Day approaches, we are flooded with advertisements about America getting its billions back, without even having to pay to prepare the forms. We get paid to play! Here is the happy ending that Kahneman and others have shown can mitigate the memories of unpleasantness past. The simple fact is that a simple tax is also rather simple to administer. Service providers kindly offer to help out the masses of befuddled Americans. Of course, these kind souls want their happy endings too. They are betting that once the large refunds become obvious to their customers, the grateful taxpayers-turned-consumers will happily purchase add-on services, such as \"audit protection insurance,\" or perhaps deposit the money in financial accounts managed by the provider. Just as lottery winners notoriously go on impulsive spending sprees, the \"found money\" of tax returns can finance many nice purchases. Of course, there are still those annoying matters of the deep unfairness of the tax laws, biased against modern families and wage earners, and in favor of the rich living off capital.  No real bother -- stuff happens. Let others fret about fairness. As long as our taxpaying or colon procedures end with a smile -- or a check -- who has time to dwell on the bad stuff that came before?\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "Danny Kahneman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and friend of the author, conducted an experiment on patients undergoing colonoscopies, revealing that those with positive end experiences had better memories of the procedure. This phenomenon, known as the \"happy ending effect,\" applies to taxes as well. Most American taxpayers receive refunds, averaging around $3,000, making tax filing simpler with free software and services. Despite complexities and biases in the U.S. tax system, the happy ending of refunds turns Tax Day into a spending spree for many. Taxes have become more of a wage tax with limited taxes on capital and fewer deductions for most filers. Service providers offer add-on services to capitalize on taxpayers' gratitude for their refunds. While issues of tax fairness persist, the happy ending of a refund mitigates the unpleasant memories of the tax-filing process.",

The vast majority of the camp's occupants are from the town of Sinjar and fled the ISIS assault there back in August. But not everyone escaped. ISIS took thousands of Yazidis captive. Men faced a choice -- convert to Islam or be shot. But the Islamist militants separated the young women and girls to be sold as sex slaves. In its fourth edition of \"Dabiq,\" the ISIS online magazine, an article titled \"The revival of slavery before the hour,\" outlines the group's twisted justification and guidelines for the enslavement of the Yazidis. \"One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar (infidels) and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of Shariah,\" the article reads. We're told that women who have just given birth or are breastfeeding are considered impure and cannot be taken as sexual slaves -- but Hanan, 19, was neither of those things. \"They separated all of us,\" she says. \"They dragged us away by our hair. They took married women, young ones. The youngest with us was just 10.  We were all crying. \"They said we are going to marry you off, you will forget your family.\" ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK. For the first week, Hanan was held with 50 others, regularly beaten and threatened with torture, and fed just a bowl of rice. The group was then taken to a three story building in Mosul she described as a sex slave warehouse, where hundreds of girls and women were held. \"They would line about 50 of us up at a time, in rows of 10.  They would say don't move, don't cry or we will beat you. The men would come in and describe the kind of girl they wanted and then they would pick and choose as they pleased,\" she recalls. She was eventually chosen, part of a group of 25.  From that group Hanan was separated into a smaller group of seven and taken into a house in a village. 'Treated like cattle': Yazidi women sold, raped, enslaved by ISIS. Two ISIS fighters guarded the door and ordered the girls to clean and bathe themselves. \"They brought in a Yazidi girl who had been with them for two months. She was wearing the black niqab. They said to us we are going to do to you what we did to her,\" Hanan says. \"The girl spoke to us in Kurdish and said they beat me, they cuffed me and raped me.\" Hanan and the others decided they had to try to escape. That night they crawled out the bedroom window. \"The fourth girl jumped out, I was the fifth. I crawled to the wall and was about to jump over it and then I saw their flashlight,\" she tells me. \"They caught the last two girls.\" They ran, and somehow evaded capture.  Four hours later they were out of ISIS territory. \"If I just see someone with a beard I start shaking,\" Hanan says. Now physically free but mentally still captive, Hanan remains tormented -- like so many others, by what she has been through and what those still with ISIS are being forced to endure -- a fate worse than death.

Their bright clothes provide splashes of color against the otherwise drab monotone white of the endless rows of tents. A small group plays with rocks, replacements for the toys they left behind when they fled, while others clamber through a jagged tear in the wire fence surrounding the refugee camp. The Shariya refugee camp opened around six months ago, made up of some 4,000 tents and counting. Thousands of Yazidis now call this corner of Iraqi Kurdistan home, about 18 miles (30 kilometers) from one of the front lines with ISIS, where one can hear the occasional reverberation in the distance of what we are told are airstrikes. The vast majority of the camp's occupants are from the town of Sinjar, which is near the border with Syrian Kurdistan, and fled the ISIS assault there back in August. But not everyone escaped. ISIS took thousands of Yazidis captive. The fighters separated the young women and girls, some as young as 8 years old, to be sold as slaves, for their \"masters\" to use as concubines. Men faced a choice: Convert to Islam or be shot. Mahmoud was out running errands when ISIS fighters arrived, taking his wife, Ahlam, their three children -- the youngest of which was just a month old -- and his elderly parents. \"They took our phones, jewelry, money,\" Ahlam recalls. \"They had guns. They forced us at gunpoint into big trailer trucks.\" They were taken to a school turned prison in Tal Afar. From there, the family was moved from village to village -- and at one stage taken to Mosul. \"They wrote everyone's name down and they asked where we want to work, in the fields, as cleaners or as herders,\" she says. Ahlam and her family chose to herd goats. They were then taken to a Shia village whose residents had fled, where they were part of a group of around 40 living in one house. In the home, Ahlam found a cell phone left behind by its former occupants and called her husband. \"I said we are alive but we are prisoners.\" Ahlam's husband, who up until that moment had lost the will to live, thinking his family was dead, says he cried out of happiness despite his pain. Ahlam would call when she could, briefly, after midnight, hiding under her bedcovers. If she was caught with a phone, she would be killed. The village itself was a massive prison, its entrances guarded by ISIS fighters. She recalls that two men, in their late 40s or 50s, tried to escape. When they were caught, their bones were broken, their bodies tied to the back of a truck and then driven through the streets. The Yazidi captives were forced to watch the gruesome spectacle. The men's corpses were then tossed into a ditch and an order given not to bury them. One night, some of the Yazidi men risked their lives to toss dirt onto the bodies, to give those slain what dignity they could. Ahlam tells us that about a week before we met, ISIS fighters came by and took away her in-laws and the other elderly people living in the house. \"We didn't know where they were taking them, we thought we would be next,\" she remembers. So she and the rest of the group realized that they had to try to flee. \"We decided that either we survive or we don't.\" They left at midnight. Ahlam cradled the baby, as her two other children, ages 3 and 4 years old, clutched at her clothes. She prayed the baby wouldn't cry, that the children could keep walking. They knew the general direction to take, but not the exact route, and they could only hope it was toward freedom. \"When the sun started to come up, I thought that's it, we are going to get caught,\" Ahlam says. \"And what am I going to do with the kids?  I can't carry all three of them and run.\" Luckily, Ahlam never had to answer that impossible question. The group made it into Iraqi Kurdistan. The couple can't put into words their emotions when they were reunited. Mahmoud, gently caressing his daughter's palm, says he could hardly believe that the woman whose stunning eyes and gentle words he had fallen in love with, and their three children, were by his side again. It had been eight agonizing months. But their joy was tainted by fear for Mahmoud's parents. A few days after Mahmoud and Ahlam were reunited, ISIS released 217 captives. No one is disclosing exactly why. Among them were 60 children, a handful of men and women, and the rest were elderly -- including Mahmoud's parents. \"We didn't know if they were going to slaughter us or what they were going to do with us,\" Mahmoud's father says. \"They moved us around a lot, and at one stage we stayed in in one place for three days.\" But Ahlam's parents are still with ISIS. Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi member of Iraq's parliament, speculates that the Yazidis ISIS released are individuals they were struggling to care for. Dakhil is part of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's delegation to the United States this week. She will be addressing the United Nations -- pleading for more international support for Iraq and more airstrikes to help defeat ISIS -- and she will address the plight of the Yazidis. \"We sometimes say that we wish we had been massacred. This would be better than being kidnapped and raped. We prefer death now over the fate of what is happening to these girls and women,\" Dakhil says. \"It is now on the government and on the international community to focus on this. How to get these captives back. It's inconceivable that in the 21st century, something like this is happening as if we were living in the Stone Age.\" Ahlam says she was spared because she was breastfeeding and she had young children, which, we're told, makes her impure and therefore unable to be used as a sex slave. For Ahlam, what she went through was not the hardest part of her ordeal. It's the moment when the ISIS fighters began taking away the girls and young women. She's haunted by their screams, the image of them being dragged away sobbing and screaming.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The Shariya refugee camp in Duhok, Iraqi Kurdistan, is home to over 4,000 tents and 4,000 Yazidi refugees, most of whom fled from the ISIS assault on Sinjar in August 2014. Thousands were taken captive by ISIS, with young women and girls sold as slaves and men given the choice to convert to Islam or be killed. One family, Mahmoud and Ahlam, were separated when ISIS took Mahmoud's wife, their three children, and his elderly parents. Ahlam and her children were taken to various villages, living in one house with around 40 other Yazidis. She managed to call her husband, who had given up hope of their survival, and they were eventually reunited in Iraqi Kurdistan after eight months. However, Mahmoud's parents are still being held captive by ISIS, along with many other elderly Yazidis. Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi member of Iraq's parliament, is advocating for more international support and airstrikes to help defeat ISIS and rescue the captives. Ahlam is haunted by the memories of the girls and women being taken away, their screams echoing in her mind.",

Forget about rampant diabetes, heart attacks and joint problems -- the scariest consequence arising out of our losing battle with the bulge is the safety of our country. In about five years, so many young Americans will be grossly overweight that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. That alarming forecast comes from Maj, Gen. Allen Batschelet, who is in charge of U.S. Army Recruiting Command. Obesity, he told me, \"is becoming a national security issue.\" I was so taken aback by Batschelet's statement that I felt the need to press him. Come on! Obesity? A national security crisis? The General didn't blink. \"In my view, yes.\" Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country, only 72,000 qualified. Some didn't make the cut because they had a criminal background, or a lack of education, or too many tattoos. But a full 10% didn't qualify because they were overweight. Before you accuse me of sensationalizing, it's that 10% figure that worries General Batschelet the most. \"The obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction,\" he said. \"We think by 2020 it could be as high as 50%, which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the Army.\" He paused. \"It's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now.\" The problem is so worrisome for the Army that recruiters have become fitness coaches, like the trainers on the NBC show, \"The Biggest Loser.\" Yes, your tax dollars pay for Army recruiters to play Dolvett Quince or Jillian Michaels to whip could-be recruits into shape with the hope they can diet and exercise their way to become real recruits. If they lose enough weight, they're sent to boot camp. Some make it; many don't. But, General Batschelet told me the Army must try. \"We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,\" he told me. \"We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.\" Except the Army never considered the type of growth it's now contending with. Nowadays \"personal development\" means working on both character and ... girth. The general, along with so many others in this country, is struggling with why so many Americans, despite all the warnings, continue to eat too much and exercise too little. I have a theory. It ain't pretty. But it's got to be true: We just don't care. \"The acceptance of obesity is prevalent,\" according to Claire Putnam, an obstetrician and gynecologist who believes obesity is a national crisis right now. \"When you look around you, 70% of adults are overweight or obese. It's seems normal,\" she said. Just look at the numbers: More than one-third of U.S. adults are obese. Seventeen percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese. That's triple the rate from just a generation ago. So, maybe we should face the fact that we've grown comfortable with our girth. It is crystal clear we haven't the foggiest idea of who needs to lose weight and who doesn't. Just the other day, Twitter trolls scolded the singer, Pink, for gaining weight. Pink is not remotely fat. Neither is Selena Gomez, haters. Or Britney Spears, hecklers. If 70% of us are overweight in this country, why are there so many willing to fat-shame people who are not remotely obese? Maybe it's easier to criticize others for carrying extra weight than to admit we have a weight problem ourselves. Because it is abundantly clear we are wallowing in denial. Dr. Putnam points to one of Kaiser Permanante's medical questionnaires. You know, the paperwork patients are asked to fill out before they see the doctor. There is actually a box on the form that allows the patient to \"opt out of talking about obesity.\" Some patients refuse to step on the scale. \"You want to be sensitive to that patient,\" Putnam told me. \"You don't want to nag. But, doctors need to step in and say we need to fix this.\" CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, agrees with Putnam. \"Perceptions of weight are a big part of the problem,\" he said to me. \"If a person is overweight -- as difficult as it is -- they ought to be told. You know, this issue reminds me of the issue with concussions. We should call them what they really are: a brain injury, not 'getting your bell rung.' In the same vein, we should tell people who are overweight or obese that, clinically, they're 'overweight' or 'obese' and at risk for just about every chronic disease in the book.\" In other words, chubby is not the proper way to describe a person who is obese. Just like \"fat\" is not the proper term for Pink or Selena Gomez. And, yes, semantics matter. According to the CDC, 81% of overweight boys and 71% of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight. We've clearly lost our perspective on what's normal when it comes to a healthy weight. So much so it's becoming a national security problem. So what will it take? The answer cannot be the U.S Army.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "The U.S. Army is facing a significant challenge due to the increasing obesity rate among young Americans. According to Maj. Gen. Allen Batschelet, the head of U.S. Army Recruiting Command, obesity is becoming a national security issue as the number of qualified recruits is decreasing. In 2015, only 72,000 out of the 195,000 young men and women who tried to join the Army qualified. Ten percent of those who didn't qualify were overweight. By 2020, the Army fears that as many as 50% of potential recruits could be overweight, leaving only 2 in 10 qualified to join. The Army is now acting as fitness coaches, helping recruits lose weight to meet the qualifications. Dr. Claire Putnam, an obstetrician and gynecologist, believes obesity is a national crisis, with more than one-third of U.S. adults and 17% of children and adolescents being obese. The acceptance of obesity in society makes it difficult for doctors to address the issue, with some patients refusing to acknowledge their weight problem or step on the scale.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nWashington (CNN)In 2011, al Qaeda took Warren Weinstein hostage. Then, about a year later, his family paid money to his captors, said a Pakistani source who was in regular contact with the kidnappers. It did not lead to the American aid worker's release, and he was inadvertently killed in an anti-terror strike in January, the White House announced Thursday. After the transfer of funds in 2012, the captors, who never referred to themselves as \"al Qaeda,\" but instead as \"Afghans,\" began demanding prisoners be released in exchange for Weinstein, most prominently Dr. Aafia Siddiqui of Pakistan, the source said. She has been described as the \"poster girl\" for Islamic jihad and is serving an 86-year sentence in the United States. The militants also wanted the release of local militants who hailed from the Pakistani province of Waziristan, along the Afghan border, the source said. The men on the other end of the phone spoke Pashto with an accent typical for the border region. And they were professional in their dealings, said the source, who noticed a marked change after the money was paid. The people who had originally talked to the source about Weinstein vanished and were replaced by new voices on the phone. The militants also connected themselves with other terror events. After ISIS beheaded American James Foley, Weinstein's Afghan captors told the source that \"the Iraqis\" were asking for the American and that they were preparing an \"orange suit\" for him -- a reference to the suits that victims have worn when ISIS militants murdered them. When the Taliban released U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, a militant on the phone bragged to the source that he had been one of Bergdahl's kidnappers. They had said, at one point, that if they did kill Weinstein, they'd announce it in a big way, because he was too big a catch not to publicly celebrate. The captors had called the source daily since sometime in 2012, and the last time the source spoke with them, in early April, they said that Weinstein was still alive. In spite of a request for proof of life, the militants didn't give one. After that, the calls stopped. The source never had a number for the militants; they had always been the ones who called. The source declined to comment on the amount of money transferred to the captors, leaving the disclosure to Weinstein's family. Could Weinstein have been saved? Weinstein's family in Maryland was initially reluctant to take their case to Congress. Weinstein's wife, Elaine, and his two daughters worried that drawing attention to their loved one's plight -- especially media attention -- would make Weinstein, a government contractor working with USAID in Pakistan, a more valuable hostage to his al Qaeda captors. But the family switched course and went to their representatives in Congress in late 2013 after a video of Weinstein -- frail and apparently in declining health -- surfaced in which he said he felt \"totally abandoned and forgotten\" by his country. Will the drone debate return? More than a year later, that reluctance evolved into a close bond between the Weinsteins and the Maryland delegation of lawmakers and staff who pressed Weinstein's case with the Obama administration as well as Pakistan. The congressional offices helped the family navigate the maze of government agencies working to free their loved one, according to one of those lawmakers and a Senate aide. \"We don't get choked up too often at work,\" Algene Sajery said as she held back tears. \"But this is really hard.\" Sajery is a foreign policy adviser to Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, who worked closely on the case. After the White House announced that Weinstein had been accidentally killed in a January U.S. drone strike, the aide's first call was to Weinstein's daughters. \"Myself and my colleague worked really closely with them, talked to them all the time ... they're just such good people,\" Sajery said of the family. \"There's a personal connection there.\" Cardin and his staff had tracked the Weinstein case since news of his abduction surfaced in August 2011, but when the family reached out to get help pressing their case, Cardin's staff joined forces with Rep. John Delaney, the Weinsteins' congressman, and began setting up meetings for the family. Cardin's staff set up meetings for the senator and Weinstein's family with everyone from the U.S. special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan to the Pakistani ambassador in Washington. Cardin and Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, wrote to President Barack Obama, calling on the U.S. to beef up efforts to secure Weinstein's release and dedicate more resources to the cause. And the staff and lawmakers helped the Weinsteins weave through the network of agencies -- from the FBI to the State Department and the White House -- working to bring Weinstein home. \"We focused on making sure that the capabilities of the government was well coordinated,\" Delaney told CNN on Thursday. \"The government is a bureaucracy, and you have to make sure that it's working.\" But for the Weinsteins and the families of other American hostages held by terror groups abroad, the government hasn't always worked well enough -- a frustration that was palpable to the staffers on Capitol Hill who worked to help them. Al Qaeda hostage Warren Weinstein killed. \"Unfortunately, the assistance we received from other elements of the U.S. Government was inconsistent and disappointing over the course of three and a half years,\" Elaine Weinstein said in a statement Thursday. \"We hope that my husband's death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the U.S. Government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families.\" It's a criticism that has resurfaced as the families of American hostages were killed abroad spoke up and voiced their frustrations with what they characterized as insufficient U.S. government efforts to bring their loved ones home. Delaney was \"saddened, disappointed and outraged that our government was not able to bring Warren home,\" he said in a statement Thursday. And in an interview with CNN later in the day, he strayed away from blaming the Obama administration or people in various U.S. agencies, instead pointing the finger at a disjointed system. The Weinstein family's frustration with that system boiled over last summer when Bergdahl, the U.S. Army sergeant, was released by a Taliban-affiliated group in exchange for five Guantanamo Bay prisoners. The U.S. policy of not negotiating with terrorists appeared to have an exception. \"It's one of those things where it's both there's some hope, but at the same time it caused them some great frustration,\" Delaney recalled, saying the family asked: \"Why not Warren?\" But as the State Department called the Bergdahl exchange a \"unique situation,\" the Weinsteins' hopes were dashed. \"That's when they asked us to really step up our efforts,\" Sajery said. \"That's when they decided to really go public.\" Delaney introduced a resolution calling on the Obama administration to use all tools necessary to bring Weinstein home and make his return -- and that of other U.S. hostages abroad -- a top priority. Mikulski, Cardin and Sens. Dick Durbin and Mark Kirk of Illinois pushed a similar resolution in the Senate. And the Weinsteins took to the airwaves, with Alisa Weinstein appearing on CNN's \"AC360\" to make a public appeal for her father's release -- and for the U.S. government to do more to secure his freedom. \"My father is just as deserving of freedom as Sgt. Bergdahl, as are all of the Americans who are being held abroad,\" she said on CNN last June. \"You cannot distinguish between these hostages. ... They can't just pick and choose, decide that it works to get one person out and then leave everybody else there.\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Thursday said that \"significant resources\" were dedicated to try to free Weinstein and that \"as painful as it is,\" the U.S policy of not negotiating with terrorists would remain in place, arguing that removing that policy could promote kidnappings abroad and put more Americans at risk. And State Department acting spokeswoman Marie Harf said many officials at the department were in touch with the Weinsteins throughout the process. While the U.S. policy of not negotiating with terrorists would remain in place, the State Department is reviewing how it works to secure the release of American hostages held by terrorists abroad, she said. The White House announced the review last fall, which Obama ordered last summer after terrorists killed or kidnapped Americans abroad. Speaking at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Friday, Obama reiterated that the White House will review what happened. \"We all bleed when we lose an American life,\" he said. \"We all grieve when any innocent life is taken. We don't take this work lightly.\" Obama made to sure to praise the intelligence community overall, noting that much of their accomplishments remain classified, while only their failures become public. \"The world doesn't always see your successes -- the threats you prevent, or the terrorist attacks you thwart, or the lives that you save,\" Obama said. \"It can be frustrating sometimes, but that's part of the function of our democracy. But I know what you do.\" But Delaney, the Weinsteins' congressman, is revving up to push for more reforms that will make government agencies more effective at finding and freeing American hostages held abroad. Delaney on Thursday called on the government to streamline the efforts of various agencies and countries in the region that help the U.S. find American hostages -- an effort he's been pushing in recent months. The tragedy of Weinstein's death could be just the momentum needed to spur those reforms. \"I think that every single American wants any American held hostage returned,\" Delaney said. \"There's tremendous support to do more.\" On Friday, Elaine Weinstein said in a statement that the family has \"been moved by the tremendous outpouring of support from around the world.\" \"We appreciate the sympathy and condolences we have received from those who knew the Warren we loved so much as well as those who did not,\" the statement said. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of others who have been taken hostage around the world as they endure these terrible ordeals.\" CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad, Pakistan; Jeremy Diamond reported and wrote from Washington; Saima Mohsin reported from Bangkok. CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "In 2011, al Qaeda kidnapped Warren Weinstein, an American aid worker. His family paid a ransom to his captors in 2012, but it did not lead to his release. Instead, Weinstein was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike in January 2015. After the transfer of funds, the militants demanded the release of prisoners, most notably Dr. Aafia Siddiqui of Pakistan, and local militants from the Pakistani province of Waziristan. They also claimed involvement in other terror events, such as the beheading of American James Foley by ISIS and the kidnapping of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl by the Taliban. The Weinstein family went to Congress for help in late 2013 after a video of Weinstein in captivity was released, showing him in declining health. The Maryland delegation of lawmakers and staff worked closely with the family to press Weinstein's case with the Obama administration and Pakistan. Despite these efforts, Weinstein was killed in the drone strike. The Weinstein family and other families of American hostages held by terror groups have criticized the U.S. government for insufficient efforts to bring their loved ones home.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nWarren Weinstein, who appears to have been the only American citizen held hostage by al Qaeda, was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike in January. But it didn't have to be that way. A senior U.S. official familiar with the handling of the issue told CNN that the U.S. government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73-year-old development expert's release, either directly to al Qaeda or through proxies in Pakistan. Another senior U.S. official told CNN that Weinstein's capture by al Qaeda made it hard for the United States to negotiate, even though proxies such as the Pakistani government have links to intermediaries who might have helped. A senior Pakistani official told CNN that after Weinstein was kidnapped, the Pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant Haqqani Network and to the Pakistani Taliban, which are both allied to al Qaeda, to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about Weinstein. According to the official, nothing came of those feelers. The senior Pakistani official says that during the past year Pakistani soldiers, who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of North Waziristan near the Afghan-Pakistan border where Weinstein was believed to be being held, went door-to-door looking for the American. Nothing came of this search either. On Thursday, the U.S. government announced that Weinstein had been killed in a \"counterterrorism operation\" in January, which is how the government often describes CIA drone strikes. According to New America, which tracks drone strikes in Pakistan, CIA drone attacks happened in Shawal, North Waziristan, on January 19 in which at least four militants were killed; also on January 15 in Tehsil Ladha, South Waziristan, in which at least five militants were killed; and on January 4 in Datta Khel, South Waziristan, in which at least eight militants were killed. It is in one of these strikes that Weinstein was almost certainly killed. Lt. Col. Jason Amerine, a planner on the U.S. Army staff, is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter's office, which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of American hostages held by al Qaeda and the Taliban. A plan was developed in the Pentagon to secure the release of Weinstein, according to a staff member on Hunter's committee. That plan was to release Haji Bashir Noorzai, a prominent and influential member of the Taliban who is in prison in the States on drug trafficking charges, in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Berghdal, who was held by the Taliban until last year; Taliban hostages Caitlin Coleman, a U.S. citizen, and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle; and Dr. Shakil Afridi, who spied for the CIA in Pakistan and was being held in a Pakistani prison, as well as Weinstein. It's not clear how far this plan of action went. Amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure. Hunter, a California Republican, released a statement Thursday, saying, \"The only government organization seriously developing options to recover Weinstein and others in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region was within the Pentagon -- led by war hero Jason Amerine.\" As an Army captain, Amerine led a small detachment of U.S. Special Forces into Afghanistan in November 2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States. The operation was instrumental in helping to topple the Taliban and to install Hamid Karzai as the new leader of Afghanistan. Who exactly carried out Weinstein's kidnapping from his house 3½  years ago in the Pakistani megacity of Lahore has until now not been clear. A senior Pakistani counterterrorism official told CNN that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, kidnapped Weinstein at his Lahore home on August 13, 2011. IMU is an Uzbek terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan. According to the Pakistani official, the leader of the Weinstein kidnapping cell was a relative of Tahir Yuldashev, the former IMU leader killed in a CIA drone strike in the Pakistani tribal regions in 2009. The initial lead that traced the Weinstein kidnapping to the IMU came from another high-profile kidnapping in Pakistan two weeks after Weinstein's abduction. Shahbaz Taseer, the son of a leading Pakistani liberal politician Salman Taseer -- who was killed by Pakistani militants eight months earlier -- was kidnapped in Lahore on August 26, 2011. At the scene of Taseer's kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and SIM card that eventually led Pakistani officials to focus on the IMU group in Lahore, according to the senior Pakistani counterterrorism official. The police subsequently arrested three Uzbeks and four Pakistanis who were part of the IMU cell that had carried out the Weinstein kidnapping. Members of the IMU cell told Pakistani interrogators that after they had kidnapped Weinstein they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi-conscious among three safe houses in Lahore. IMU members then took Weinstein to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan, a semi-autonomous region along the border with Afghanistan where al Qaeda and other militant groups are headquartered. There Weinstein was given or, more likely, sold to al Qaeda, according to the senior Pakistani official. Who was Warren Weinstein? Weinstein had spent his life helping others, working in the fields of aid and development. He held a doctorate in international law and economics from Columbia University and spoke more than half a dozen languages. After his capture, the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, demanded the end of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and the release of terrorists held in U.S. custody in exchange for Weinstein's freedom. On September 12, 2012, Weinstein appeared in a video produced by al Qaeda's production arm in which he said that the Obama administration had shown \"no interest in my case.\" He then appealed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from \"one Jew to another\" to intervene. The Obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy, which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by ISIS, al Qaeda or the Taliban. The key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the U.S. government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them. The CIA, for instance, is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations, while the FBI has responsibility for retrieving American hostages. Often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with Weinstein. The CIA could have exercised more due diligence knowing that Weinstein was almost certainly being held in North Waziristan. There are some solutions for these problems. First, families should be granted security clearances by the U.S. government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones. Right now, the U.S. government won't communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives don't have the requisite security clearances. Should families abuse their clearances, they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones, which is a strong incentive not to abuse them. Second, President Barack Obama should appoint a senior-level person, perhaps working in the White House on the National Security Council, to oversee the work of the CIA, FBI, State Department and the Joint Special Operations Command, which implements hostage rescues. All these organizations have key roles to play in getting American hostages home. That person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and \"de-conflict\" any potential issues, such as the ones that surfaced in the Weinstein case. Third, while the U.S. government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups, there is nothing in American policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of U.S. citizens, and this should be encouraged, even if there is some quid pro quo involved. This is what happened in the case of the American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, who was captured by al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria in 2012, but was released last year after the Qatari government intervened in his case. The Qataris have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in Syria, including the al Qaeda affiliate holding Curtis, and while Qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free Curtis, it's unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of al Qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys. Curtis' successful release could provide a ray of hope for U.S. citizen Caitlin Coleman and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle, who were captured by the Taliban in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through Afghanistan. A senior American official told CNN they are being held by the Haqqani Network. The Pakistani government has contacts with the Haqqani Network, and the U.S. government should ratchet up the pressure on the Pakistani government to secure the couple's release. In captivity, Coleman, who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage, had a child. The name of the child is unknown.\n\noutput:",

The U.S. government is currently reviewing its hostage policy, which has been criticized for lack of communication with families and coordination between agencies. To address these issues, families should be granted security clearances to receive classified information about their loved ones, a senior-level official should oversee the work of relevant agencies, and the U.S. government should encourage other governments to negotiate with terrorists for the release of U.S. citizens.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nA year ago Bloomberg published a story with the following headline: Mike Pence, a Koch Favorite, Mulls 2016 Run for President. The story ticked off items on Pence's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed Koch brothers, as well as other right-wing lobbying groups. Last August the Indiana governor was in Dallas for an Americans for Prosperity event; the group is backed by the conservative Koch brothers, and supported Gov. Pence's tax-slashing budget. Now, Pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians.  Why would Pence ignore the pleas of Indiana's Chamber of Commerce as well as the Republican mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill? Because there's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was Pence's way of shoring up his street cred. It is also the reason why Republican Jeb Bush, Pence's fellow White House hopeful, who is viewed as a little light in that category, was first to rush in to defend Pence and the law. One lesson here: Just because more than 70% of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70% of the country is happy about it. Backlash aside, the fact is Pence has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives. And while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump, the very public debate that now embroils him — and Arkansas Gov.  Asa Hutchinson, and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire Republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped. Pence: 'Was I expecting this kind of backlash? Heavens no.' For there is no way a Republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing LGBT rights, which unfortunately will turn numerous Americans into single-issue voters. I foolishly hoped the issue of LGBT rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election, overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy. Instead it looks like it's going to be dragged down to a replay of Pat Buchanan's \"cultural war\" speech, during which he told the 1992 Republican National Convention: \"We stand with (George H.W. Bush) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women\" and later followed with \"There is a religious war going on in this country. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the Cold War itself. For this war is for the soul of America.\" Progressives may enjoy watching Pence's temporary fall from grace, but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has indicated a federal ban on same-sex marriage is not off the GOP table. And even if you think neither Pence nor Bush nor Cruz will win the nomination, someone has to. In light of that, listen to conservative former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a potential 2016 candidate describing  conservatives' discomfort with same-sex marriage: \"It's like asking someone who's Jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli.\" Or Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal: \"I certainly will support Ted Cruz and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage.\" Or Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has a long history of fighting against same-sex marriage and civil unions. And Ben Carson said jail turns people gay, so there's that. Remember: Pence didn't act alone. He only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials. In fact, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, \"the Indiana RFRA [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate. Numerous other bills specifically single out the LGBT community for unequal treatment.\" Who supports, denounces Indiana law? Gallup Polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay-friendly, but the trend on the state level tells a different story. Perhaps we're witnessing the final gasp of long-ago biases. Or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated. Former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the first member of Congress to marry someone of the same sex while in office, said he believes Republicans want the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage to provide political cover in the GOP primary. \"We're winning,\" he told a crowd in Chicago recently while promoting his latest book. I guess if you look at where the country was on LGBT issues 10 years ago, we definitely are. That's assuming you are part of the \"we\" who believe LGBT people should have the same rights as their heterosexual/cisgender counterparts. But as the situation in Indiana has shown, \"winning\" should not be mistaken for having \"won.\" For it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so-called \"religious freedom\" bills snaking through red-state legislatures. Or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it's raised in a debate or at a campaign stop, especially with Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate. Pence, and to a lesser extent, Jeb Bush, may be toxic now but America has a short attention span. More importantly, they are not alone. Frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets, and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls. If that holds true in 2016, \"winning\" is going to feel very strange.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 80 words:\nSky watchers in western North America are in for a treat: a nearly five-minute total lunar eclipse this morning. Here's how it's unfolding:. It started at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, when the moon began moving into Earth's shadow.  For the next hour and 45 minutes, that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time. The total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds, and NASA says that makes it the shortest one of the century. Watch it live on NASA TV. While people west of the Mississippi River will have the best view, at least a partial eclipse will be visible across the nation. But sunrise will interrupt the show on the East Coast. Parts of South America, India, China and Russia also will be able to see the eclipse, but it won't be visible in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Africa or the Middle East. A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow. As the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color.  Why red? Because Earth's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light. Some people have nicknamed the effect the \"blood moon.\" NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a \"tetrad.\"  The first was on April 15, 2014. The second was in September 2014, the next is Saturday and there will be one more, on September 28. If you want to learn more about the eclipse, NASA astronomer Mitzi Adams will take questions on Twitter @NASA_Marshall. Did you see the total lunar eclipse?

        "answer": "A total lunar eclipse of nearly five minutes is occurring on the west coast of North America on the morning of September 27, starting at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time. The total eclipse will last only four minutes and 43 seconds, making it the shortest of the century. It is the third in a series of four lunar eclipses, known as a \"tetrad,\" with the next one on September 28. The eclipse is caused by the alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon, resulting in the moon passing through Earth's shadow, appearing dark or reddish due to Earth's atmosphere filtering out blue light. The eclipse is best viewed in western North America, but parts of South America, India, China, and Russia will also see it. NASA TV is broadcasting the event live.",

The Indiana woman's story became known around the world last year when she was able to realize her dream of playing college basketball. Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati successfully petitioned the NCAA to move up the opening game of its schedule to accommodate her desire to play. Hill died early Friday. At a ceremony honoring her life on the school's campus Friday afternoon, head coach Dan Benjamin said the toughest thing a coach has to deal with is a loss. The community had lost more than a player, he said. It lost a friend and a daughter. And it lost \"an unselfish angel.\" \"It's not often you get to celebrate a loss,\" he told the crowd as he struggled to hold in his tears. \"But today we celebrate a victory on how to live a life, through Lauren Hill. (No.) 22 you will be missed and remembered by so many.\" An assistant coach read a quote from Hill:. \"I encourage everyone to cherish every moment with no worry about the past or anxiety about the future. Because the next moment is never promised. Never leave anything unsaid. I have learned to see the blessings in every moment and through every struggle, no matter how tough it might be. Nothing holds me back from living my life and chasing my dreams. I always finish what I start and see it through to the end. Never give up on your dreams. Find something to fight for; I fight for others.\" Hill would go on to help raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research with the nonprofit group The Cure Starts Now. The organization called her a \"worldwide inspiration.\" \"Lauren captured the hearts of people worldwide with her tenacity and determination to play in her first collegiate basketball game with her Mount St. Joseph University team,\" the group said on Facebook. People we've lost in 2015. Mount St. Joseph University President Tony Artez said Hill's \"love and laughter will remain in our hearts.\" \"We are forever grateful to have had Lauren grace our campus with her smile and determined spirit,\" Artez said in a statement. \"She has left a powerful legacy. She taught us that every day is a blessing, every moment a gift.\" Her principal at Lawrenceburg High School, Bill Snyder, announced her death to students Friday morning. \"Lauren's message was constantly positive,\" he told CNN. \"We all need to work together to beat obstacles. Not just cancer. In any situation we can be positive.\" As news of her death spread, social media lit up with messages honoring her life. NBA great LeBron James called her the \"true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership.\" \"The greatest accomplishment we can achieve as humans is to inspire many,\" Twitter user Just_AP wrote. \"Lauren Hill did that.\" NCAA President Mark Emmert said Hill's \"enthusiasm and strength were an inspiration not only to those who knew her best, but also to the millions of people she touched around the world by sharing her story.\" \"Lauren achieved a lasting and meaningful legacy, and her beautiful spirit will continue to live on,\" he said in a statement. Hill was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma in 2013 when she was a senior in high school. The rare brain tumor was inoperable, but Hill persisted in playing on her high school team despite chemotherapy treatments. \"I never gave up for a second, even when I got a terminal diagnosis, never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore,\" she told CNN affiliate WKRC-TV at the time. She had already committed to play for Mount St. Joseph when she was diagnosed. In October, the school received permission from the NCAA to move up its first scheduled game so Hill could play. In front of a sellout crowd, many wearing T-shirts bearing her name and slogan, \"Never Give Up,\" watched the ballplayer score the first two points and the final layup of the game. \"Today has been the best day I've ever had,\" Hill told the crowd after the game. \"I don't know what to say but thank you.\" CNN's Jill Martin, Emanuella Grinberg and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nMountaineers have returned to Mount Everest for this year's climbing season, resuming the quest to summit the world's highest peak after a deadly season last year. In 2014, the Nepal climbing season ended after a piece of glacial ice fell, unleashing an avalanche that killed 16 Nepalis who had just finished their morning prayers. The April 18 accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on Mount Everest. The deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the Sherpas and the dangers of climbing Everest. In order to reduce risks, the route through Khumbu Icefall, the notoriously treacherous path where the 16 were killed, has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer. \"They're going in the icefall and, as we found out on April 18, it's the most dangerous place,\" said Conrad Anker, a veteran climber who has been to Everest three times. \"They're exposed to the tumbling ice, hanging seracs above it. It's very, very dangerous. It's the most dangerous place I've been in the mountains.\" At this point in the season, climbing teams have not yet entered Khumbu Icefall, which is essentially a frozen river rapid with jagged pieces breaking off and moving. Nepal has issued 347 permits this year to climb Mount Everest, with 125 of them from the previously shortened season, according to the Nepal Ministry of Tourism.  It's a slight increase from the 334 who were given permission last year. The local Nepalese committee that determines the path up Everest announced in February that a different route had been selected. The climbers will now take a central route through the Khumbu Icefall, avoiding the area where the deaths occurred. The committee comprised of Sherpas voted to return to the central route for safety reasons. \"There will be little risk of avalanche than in the right or left,\" said Yangji Doma Sherpa, the spokeswoman for the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee. The central route had been used in the 1990s, but was abandoned in favor of a quicker route, she said. The new path means climbers will have to cross more crevasses, and use more vertical and horizontal ladders. The committee issued a recommendation that the weight of workers' gear be limited to avoid overloading the ladders. \"I think it will be an hour longer on the icefall,\" said Alan Arnette, who is blogging from Everest base camp this season. \"I don't think it will be game changer.\" But one company, Alpenglow Expeditions, said it would stop climbing from the Nepal side, where the climbers have to go through the icefall, in favor of the northern route from China. \"We've seen it get progressively more dangerous over the last few years,\" said  Adrian Ballinger, the company's founder and CEO. \"We believe the risk is too great for our workers.\" According to the China Tibet Mountaineering Association, 320 people have been registered to climb the northern route to Everest this year. That's 136 more than last year. The Chinese side of Everest has typically been less popular than its Nepal counterpart, because of concerns of government closures. Some Everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain, but it also doesn't have an icefall. The increasing popularity of the northern route has caused concern amongst Nepali companies that climbers will divert to the Chinese side. \"I can already see the shift with mountaineers I speak to,\" said Dawa Steven Sherpa, who is based in Nepal. \"More people are going to go to Tibet than Nepal. Nepal needs the tourism far more than China does. China has incredible wealth of resources and Nepal does not.\" Leading expeditions is how Sherpas feed their families and send their children to school. Nepal depends heavily on tourism dollars. Many of the guides had to bury their friends after the accident last year, and while they may be ready to return to the summit, their families are not. Many of them are \"leaving behind nervous, stressed-out wives and children,\" whose memories of what happened last year are fresh, said Dawa Sherpa, managing director of Asian Trekking. \"They do say they don't want to put them through that again,\" he said. \"They're not fearful for their own lives, it's what they're putting their family through.\" Several mountaineers are also returning this year. One of them is Jon Reiter, who spoke to CNN last year after the tragedy. When the icy avalanche thundered down, Reiter was shoved behind an ice block by his Sherpa guide. Reiter, who is making his way to base camp this year, could not be reached directly. But he explained why he's heading back to Everest this year on his blog. \"I can't quite find the words to tell you why, or what really pulls me back to the mountains,\" he wrote. \"When we were in the midst of last year's events it was hard to see the big picture. It was hard to remember that people die in the mountains but that it's more rare than not. \"It was hard for me to remember that I'm not choosing between my life at home and dying in the mountains. I like to think it's similar to surviving a plane crash or a major pile up on the freeway.\" CNN's Sugam Pokharel contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

Now, Copenhagen residents can live in a new neighborhood set to emerge on the historic grounds of the famous beer-maker in the heart of Danish capital. The area in question -- aptly named Carlsberg City -- has been home to the famous Carlsberg brewery since 1847, and with it a big slice of Danish cultural history. But the brewery has moved on and the future is moving in. Amidst the district's historic treasure trove of protected architectural buildings will be some 600,000 square meters (6.4 million sq ft) of residential, business, sporting, cultural, and educational space. Prices range from just below Copenhagen's average $5,000 per square meter to about $12,000 -- well below other major European cities. Modeled after intimate medieval towns, Carlsberg City won \"Best Master Plan\" at the World Architecture Festival in 2009. The project has since attracted interest from all over the world. \"Scandinavia has over the past years been attractive to foreign investors,\" said Claus Lonborg, CEO of Copenhagen Capacity, a non-profit with the aim of growing business in the Danish capital. He added that \"given the number of infrastructure and construction developments taking place in the greater Copenhagen area now, we really see an increasing demand and interest.\" While the first apartments in Carlsberg City went up for sale in March, the area has been alive for years. Investors invited temporary renters into old buildings during the construction phase which began shortly after the 2008 financial crisis hit. The area has since been home to skateboarders, bikers, modern dancers, cafes, the national football team for homeless people and a climbing forest. And the head of Carlsberg City says this ploy has more than paid off. \"The temporary activities have been keeping Carlsberg City on the landmap even in planning,\" said Jens Nyhus, CEO of CarlsbergByen (Carlsberg City). \"When the financial crisis started (they) were a way to keep the building occupied and from running down. It kept the city alive and opened up.\" But just because new tenants have moved in doesn't mean it's brewing history will be gone completely. Carlsberg will remain very much inside Carlsberg City, making specialty beer and building a tourist center that is expected to attract half-a-million visitors per-year when it opens in 2017. \"We call it Carlsberg brand and experience center,\" said Thomas Kjelfred, communications consultant at Visit Carlsberg. \"(But) it's not a brand house, it's a brew house. Until six years ago, we brewed 200 million liters a beer (here)\" \"To a Dane, Carlsberg is more than a beer. It is art, it is science, it is culture.\" And soon, it will also be a city.\n\noutput:",

A new CNN/ORC poll finds 57% feel businesses such as caterers or florists should be required to serve gay or lesbian couples just as they would heterosexual couples, while 41% say they should be allowed to refuse service for religious reasons. That's a shift from a Pew Research Center poll conducted last fall, which found just 49% thought businesses ought to be required to serve same-sex couples while 47% that they should be allowed to refuse service on religious grounds. Since the Pew poll last fall, Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed into law in late March by Republican governor Mike Pence, sparked a nationwide controversy over whether the law allowed wedding-related businesses to refuse service to gay and lesbian couples. Apple, Walmart and the NCAA all spoke out against the law, while some states and cities with Democratic leaders barred spending public money in Indiana. Pence and other Indiana legislators insisted discrimination was not the law's intent and a bill to change the original law was signed in early April. In the CNN/ORC Poll, most Democrats (70%) and independents (60%) say wedding-related businesses should be required to provide services to same-sex couples as they would different-sex couples, while Republicans break broadly the other way, 67% say religious reasons are a valid justification for refusing service. Full poll results. Looking at Republicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party, 60% in that group say wedding-related businesses should be allowed to refuse services to same-sex couples, but there are sharp divides within that group by age and ideology. Moderate and liberal Republicans and Republican-leaners broadly say wedding-related businesses should be required to serve all couples the same way (58%) while three-quarters of conservative Republicans favor allowing a caterer or florist to refuse service for religious reasons (74%). Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents under age 50, 56% say wedding-related businesses should be required to serve same-sex and different-sex couples the same way while among those age 50 or older, 72% think they should not be required to do so. The big gay wedding cake quiz. Age differences hold across party lines, but the generation gap among Republicans and Republican-leaners is larger than that among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Overall, white evangelicals are broadly in favor of allowing businesses to refuse service for religious reasons - 62% say they should be able to. But among whites who are not evangelicals, 61% say such businesses should be required to provide services to all couples the same way. The shift from the Pew Center results comes across demographic lines. Men, women, whites, younger adults and senior citizens all are more apt than in the Pew poll to say wedding-related business should be required to serve same-sex couples as they do others. The CNN/ORC International poll was conducted by telephone, April 16-19, among a random national sample of 1,018 adult Americans. Results for the full poll have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Michigan auto repair shop says yes to gun owners, no to homosexuals.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "According to a new CNN/ORC poll, approximately six in ten Americans believe that businesses providing wedding-related services should be required to serve same-sex couples equally, despite religious objections. This is a shift from a previous Pew Research Center poll conducted last fall, which found that slightly fewer Americans held this view. The controversy over Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed into law in March 2015, sparked a nationwide debate on this issue. The poll reveals significant differences in opinions among Democrats, independents, and Republicans. While most Democrats and independents support the requirement for businesses to serve all couples equally, a majority of Republicans believe religious reasons are a valid justification for refusing service. Age and ideology also play a role in shaping opinions within the Republican Party. White evangelicals are more likely to support the right of businesses to refuse service for religious reasons. The poll was conducted from April 16-19, 2015, among a random national sample of 1,018 adult Americans, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 169 words:\nIt is not hard to imagine the conversations inside the Hillary Clinton camp prelaunch: How do we take the best known woman in the world and make her seem like less of a big shot? How can the people in Iowa and New Hampshire get to know the \"real Hillary,\" the Midwestern Methodist? (As a friend told me, she's someone who \"likes to sing 'God Bless America' on New Year's Eve.\") And how to open the minds of people about someone everyone already has an opinion about? Same questions, no doubt, that the staff asked in 2008 when she ran against the newbie Barack Obama, and same questions they asked when, as first lady, she ran for the Senate in New York. In that race, she ended up spending a lot of all-ears quality time in upstate New York. In this race, she could be spending a lot of all-you-can-eat time at Diners, Drive-ins and Dives — just like the TV show. (Except Guy Fieri would probably have been recognized by the crowd at Chipotle. Just sayin.' ) Dining aside, it's hard -- almost impossible -- to soft-launch a campaign with a superstar politician.  All the gauzy ads and the small classrooms and the coffee shops can't mask the Houdini-like effort Hillary Clinton is making to escape the inescapable reality -- that even her \"Scooby-Doo\" van is followed by throngs of press. (I half imagined an O.J. moment with a helicopter hovering as she made her way down I-80.) Try as she might to launch with a humble start — not entitled to anything — she still is who she is. Virtually unchallenged. Not to mention famous, accomplished and controversial. In watching it all unfold, it's hard to underestimate the task at hand. It's also hard to figure out whether it's actually going to work. Hillary Clinton — and her experienced campaign team — are disciplined and relentlessly on message. That's usually a good thing when you're running a presidential campaign. But when you're sitting at a community college in Iowa and you tick off your rationale for running and your resume — unprompted — it seems less effective and more oddly incongruent. (Especially when the former secretary of state described her tenure in five words — as \"standing up for our country.\" Short shrift, it seems to me.) Maybe it's that the old lessons of message discipline don't work in the informal environment the campaign is trying to create — at least not with this candidate. The hardest combination in politics is that just-right mixture of spontaneity and discipline. The ability to understand exactly what you have to say (over and over) and then say it as if you have never said it before. And look like you're having a great time doing it. We like to call it authenticity, but it's probably not. It's a honed skill that combines connection and gravitas, both of which the voters demand in a president. (A majority of voters -- 53% --  say they want to vote for someone who has been financially successful, as opposed to someone who has not.) So there's this balance: If you're too much like them, you're nothing special to vote for. But if you're too different, you're not relatable. It's a balance that doesn't come easily to Hillary Clinton. But she's not alone. When President George H.W. Bush was running for re-election in 1992, he was facing his own image issues. His populist challengers were calling him insensitive to middle class woes in the struggling state of New Hampshire. Bush tried mightily to drop the presidential persona, did some town halls, and famously declared:  \"Message: I care.\" Some said he actually read it from a cue card, but he also said this: \"I don't know what I have to do to convince people here that I really care about this (the economy). I do.\" He lost. To an empathetic I-feel-your-pain Bill Clinton. And the rest, as they say, is history. Or, in Hillary's case, at least trying to make history.\n\noutput:",

Comparisons are drawn to her previous campaigns, including her 2008 bid against Barack Obama and her 2000 Senate run in New York. The article suggests that Clinton's disciplined and on-message approach may not be effective in the informal campaign setting, and that finding the right balance between spontaneity and discipline is a difficult task for her. The article also references George H.W. Bush's failed attempt to connect with voters in 1992 and the importance of authenticity in presidential campaigns.",

From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy. According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea.

It was a call to action: Within hours of the first 7.8 magnitude quake, India began planning a massive cross-border aid mission. With each hour, the scale of the devastation in Nepal became clearer -- some 3,862 people are known to have died so far -- and plans in India, where 72 people were also killed, got bigger. On Sunday alone, India delivered 187 tons of supplies, including 50 tons of water, 22 tons of food and 2 tons of medicine. And there will be more to come. Hundreds of trained disaster relief troops landed in Kathmandu and quickly got to work. With each flight in, there was a flight back out, packed with Indians and other nationals escaping to safety: 2,000 and counting have fled so far. By Monday, India was in full-scale crisis mode: From airports across India, planes flew in loaded with aid, and trucks made the trip by land from India's east, aiming for more remote areas. On the ground: Devastation in Nepal. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a special effort over Nepal. He has visited the country twice in his first year in office. And on Sunday, in his national radio address to the nation, he said Indians needed to \"wipe the tears of every Nepali, hold their hands, and stand with them.\" It all highlights the more proactive role taken by India in recent months. Just weeks ago, India flexed its military muscle to rescue Indians and other nationals from conflict-torn Yemen. Now, it is taking the lead in Nepal. Some might say India's friendship is a signal for the other big country that shares a border with Nepal: China. A display of hard power, perhaps to achieve enduring soft power in the region. But in times like this, help is always welcome. First there's the immediate search and rescue operation, and then the long process of rebuilding work. Nepal will need India's friendship -- as well as China's -- for many long months ahead.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nFor years, Warren Weinstein's family frantically searched for details about his whereabouts and pushed for his release. His wife said she was still searching for answers Thursday after U.S. officials revealed the 73-year-old American aid worker had been accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike targeting al Qaeda. \"We were so hopeful that those in the U.S. and Pakistani governments with the power to take action and secure his release would have done everything possible to do so, and there are no words to do justice to the disappointment and heartbreak we are going through,\" Elaine Weinstein said in a statement. \"We do not yet fully understand all of the facts surrounding Warren's death, but we do understand that the U.S. government will be conducting an independent investigation of the circumstances.\" Gunmen abducted Weinstein in 2011 from his home in Lahore, Parkistan. They posed as neighbors, offered food and then pistol-whipped the American aid worker and tied up his guards, his family said. Just a few months after Weinstein's capture, al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a recording claiming the terror group was holding Weinstein -- and demanding, among other things, that the United States end airstrikes in Pakistan. U.S. officials called for his release but repeatedly said Washington wouldn't bargain with al Qaeda. Weinstein -- a husband, father and grandfather from Rockville, Maryland -- was 73 years old when he was killed, according to a family website detailing information about his case. He worked in Pakistan as a contractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development from 2004 to 2011, the website says. His employer, Virginia-based consulting firm J.E. Austin Associates Inc., described him as a world-renowned development expert. \"Warren spent his entire life working to benefit people across the globe and loved the work that he did to make people's lives better,\" his wife said Thursday. He loved the Pakistani people and their culture, she said, learning to speak Urdu and doing \"everything he could to show his utmost and profound respect for the region.\" As he announced Weinstein's death Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama praised what he said was Weinstein's lifelong dedication to service, first as a Peace Corps volunteer and later as a USAID contractor. Weinstein, Obama said, was someone who \"willingly left the comforts of home to help the people of Pakistan,\" focusing his work on helping families escape poverty to give their children a better life. \"This was a man who basically dedicated his life to service, to people in general, but especially to people in a country where the standard of living was low and difficult. ... It's tragic that he was killed the way he was,\" former U.S. Ambassador Dan Simpson said. Simpson met Weinstein in 1968 when they were both working in Burundi -- Simpson as a diplomat and Weinstein as a scholar researching several books. Weinstein \"was a very kind person,\" Simpson said, \"and someone who was very sensitive to the needs of the people who he worked with.\" Another hostage was also killed in the January operation, Italian aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto. U.S. officials knew they were targeting an al Qaeda compound in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region in the January counterterrorism operation, Obama said, but they didn't know that the hostages were also there. Both Lo Porto and Weinstein were people who \"believed passionately\" that they could make a difference, Obama said. \"There could be no starker contrast between these two selfless men and their al Qaeda captors,\" Obama said Thursday. \"Warren's work benefited people across faiths. Meanwhile, al Qaeda boasted to the world that it held Warren citing his Jewish faith.\" Weinstein's health had been deteriorating, Obama said. Last year daughter Alisa Weinstein told CNN her father suffered from a heart condition and severe asthma. But it was still an optimistic time for the family. That month captors released U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, and that buoyed hopes from Weinstein's family that he could also be freed. \"They have shown with this exchange that they can get this done. If they want to, they can do this,\" Alisa Weinstein said at the time. \"So I know that they can do it for us and they can do it for others.\" But a prisoner swap never happened for Weinstein, even though his family pushed for one. Al Qaeda released a video of Weinstein on Christmas 2013. He appeared gaunt and said he was suffering. \"Needless to say, I've been suffering deep anxiety every part of every day, not knowing what is happening to my family and not knowing how they are and because I am not with them,\" Weinstein said in the video. At the time, a former colleague and friend said his appearance in the video was jarring. \"Quite honestly, I didn't recognize him in the picture,\" Laurie Wiseberg told CNN. \"He has changed so dramatically from the person he used to be in terms of appearance and I would hope something could be done so he has a chance to be reunited with his family, his wife, his children and grandchildren, and not have to die in a foreign country far away from those he loves.\" At the time, The Washington Post also reported that it had received a letter from Weinstein. The letter, which was also posted on the website of the SITE Intelligence group, described his background doing human rights work. The letter said that before becoming a consultant in 2003, Weinstein had worked as a college professor at the State University of New York - Oswego, as a Peace Corps country director in Togo and Ivory Coast and for USAID and the World Bank. \"I hope that the media can mount a campaign to get the American government to actively pursue my release and to make sure that I am not forgotten and just become another statistic,\" the letter said. \"Given my age and my health I don't have time on my side.\" Weinstein's wife's statement on Thursday thanked some but also blasted the governments of the United States and Pakistan for not doing more to help her husband. While Maryland members of Congress -- Rep. John Delaney, Sen. Barbara Mikulski and Sen. Ben Cardin -- and members of the FBI were \"relentless\" in efforts to free her husband, she said others in the U.S. government were \"inconsistent and disappointing over the course of 3½ years.\" \"We hope that my husband's death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the U.S. government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families,\" she said. Pakistani government and military officials also should have done more, she said. \"Warren's safe return should have been a priority for them based on his contributions to their country, but they failed to take action earlier in his captivity when opportunity presented itself, instead treating Warren's captivity as more of an annoyance than a priority,\" she said. \"I hope the nature of our future relationship with Pakistan is reflective of how they prioritize situations such as these.\" But ultimately, she said her husband's captors are the ones responsible for his death. \"I can assure you that he would still be alive and well if they had allowed him to return home after his time abroad working to help the people of Pakistan,\" she said. \"The cowardly actions of those who took Warren captive and ultimately to the place and time of his death are not in keeping with Islam and they will have to face their God to answer for their actions.\" Opinion: Could Weinstein have been saved? CNN's Elise Labott, Jim Sciutto and Pamela Brown contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

Calls for Lee to resign began after South Korean tycoon Sung Woan-jong was found hanging from a tree in Seoul in an apparent suicide on April 9. Sung, who was under investigation for fraud and bribery, left a note listing names and amounts of cash given to top officials, including those who work for the President. Lee and seven other politicians with links to the South Korean President are under investigation. A special prosecutor's team has been established to investigate the case. Lee had adamantly denied the allegations as the scandal escalated: \"If there are any evidence, I will give out my life. As a Prime Minister, I will accept Prosecutor Office's investigation first.\" Park has said that she is taking the accusations very seriously. Before departing on her trip to Central and South America, she condemned political corruption in her country. \"Corruption and deep-rooted evil are issues that can lead to taking away people's lives. We take this very seriously.\" \"We must make sure to set straight this issue as a matter of political reform. I will not forgive anyone who is responsible for corruption or wrongdoing.\" Park is in Peru and is expected to arrive back to South Korea on April 27. CNN's Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

In a two-hour special that aired Friday, the Olympic gold medalist and \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians\" star said he has the \"soul of a female\" even though he was born with male body parts. Thompson, who had two sons with Jenner during their five-year marriage, was one of many relatives to cheer Jenner for publicly sharing what she had known for decades. \"I have respectfully kept his secrets private and would have taken his confidences to my grave had he not spoken out,\" she said in a column for the Huffington Post. \"He can finally realize his need to be who he authentically is, who he was born to be. That takes tremendous courage. For that I commend him.\" Thompson wrote that she would not have married Jenner if she had known about his \"gender issue\" when they first met. But she's glad she didn't know because she would have missed the chance to share a life with him, including their two sons. \"Looking back, I'm so grateful to God, the universe, and Bruce that I didn't know, and that Bruce played the role in my life that he did,\" she said in the column. The two met in 1979 at a celebrity tennis tournament at the Playboy Mansion, while Jenner was in the process of separating from his first wife. The two married on January 5, 1981, and made Hawaii their home. Their first son, Brandon, was born in 1981, followed by son Brody in 1983. \"The Bruce I knew back then was an easygoing, down-to-earth, casual, romantic, good and loving man. I was extremely happy to have found such a remarkable partner with whom to share my life. I found him to be honorable and, well, just too good to be true. Just too good to be true indeed,\" she wrote. They were a celebrity \"glamour couple\" of the time, appearing regularly on red carpets, hosting charitable fundraisers and traveling the world together for their careers. Jenner's star grew, and was a man that other men aspired to be, and someone women wanted to be with. \"The Bruce I knew back then was unstudied, affable, and seemingly very comfortable in his own skin. So it seemed.\" Thompson said Jenner told her in 1985 that, despite it all, \"he identified as a woman\" and hoped to move forward with the process of becoming a woman.\" Confused and desperate, Thompson suggested therapy to help her understand what he was going through and \"determine if it was something we could overcome or 'fix.'\" \"I was pretty ignorant of the fact that being transgender isn't something that can be overcome, fixed, prayed away, exorcised or obliterated by any other arcane notion,\" she said. He considered traveling out of the country for gender-confirmation surgery and returning to the United States identifying as female, where his children could meet him as \"Aunt Heather.\" They separated after going to therapy for about six months and Jenner began taking female hormones and removing his hair through electrolysis. As he started developing breasts, his children began to notice -- a claim that Jenner also made in his interview. Thompson says Jenner did not remain a presence in their lives after he married Kris Kardashian, mother of Kim, Khloe, Khourtney and Rob Kardashian. Together, the couple had two children, Kendall and Kylie. Thompson said she forgives Jenner for those years. He has already \"been held prisoner in his own flesh\" and hopes that his life will get easier now. In addition to \"world's greatest athlete,\" she hopes people will remember him as \"trailblazer for the civil rights of the transgender community.\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nCiudad Juarez, Mexico, was once known as the murder capital of the world. Back in 2010, at the height of cartel violence, the city averaged 8.5 killings per day. But five years later, local officials say the city is much safer, and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to Juarez. This month the city launched the tourism campaign \"Juarez is Waiting for You.\" The rebranding effort started quietly a year ago, and on April 10, it was on full display. Mayor Enrique Serrano officially kicked off the campaign, giving what he called an \"unprecedented\" high-profile tour to regional leaders from the United States and Mexico. U.S. Rep. Robert \"Beto\" O'Rourke of Texas was one of those on a leg of the Juarez tour. His congressional district includes El Paso, Texas, which sits directly across the Rio Grande. O'Rourke says there's good reason for locals to be hopeful. \"As a region, El Paso and Juarez represent 20% of all U.S-Mexico trade. The binational ties are strong and have remained strong,\" O'Rourke says. \"Yes, we had a really difficult time for a ... period. Juarez was at one time the deadliest city in the world.\" O'Rourke speaks of a time between 2009 and 2012 when men, women and children were killed indiscriminately. Many were helplessly caught in the cartel violence. Others were victims of the drug turf war. It wasn't that long ago, O'Rourke says, that he thought twice about crossing the bridge into Juarez. \"(Now) I travel to Juarez regularly to have lunch or meet people or just to go. I always feel safe and secure.\" A spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN that at one point, there were days when Juarez had more than 20 killings. \"That was normal,\" spokesman Julio Castaneda told CNN. \"It's safer now.\" The numbers from the attorney general's office seem to bear that out. More than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago, but so far this year there have been 89 killings, according to Castaneda -- a dramatic decrease in the violence. \"Undoubtedly, the work we did here in the past year with the police institutions, and specifically the local police, helped. There was a coordinated effort between agencies,\" Castaneda said. \"Without a doubt this work played a part in breaking apart the gangs that were plaguing the city.\" The government cleaned up corruption within the local police force, and fired or arrested a lot of bad cops who were helping the cartels. Another factor that may have helped: The turf war between the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels essentially ended, with the Sinaloa cartel claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in Juarez. O'Rourke argues that the El Paso-Juarez border is \"safer than it's ever been.\" He cites the \"30 million lawful crosses from El Paso into Juarez\" last year as a symbolic step. Yet there are those who don't want to celebrate too soon. \"For Juarez to be considered a safe city, there's a long way to go,\" says Sergio Meza, executive director for Plan Estrategico de Juarez, an independent organization that works to improve the city's quality of life. \"Just this past year (in 2014) there were 424 homicides. In 2007, there were 272. Yes, we're not as bad. But we're still very sick,\" Meza told CNN from his office in Juarez. \"In reality, we're progressing from the conditions that were generated by the insecurity. We're still working out the corruption in the city. It's still an issue here.\" With more than 40% of Juarez living below the poverty line, according to Plan Estrategico de Juarez, the future of the city will depend on \"the people's participation in public matters.\" In fact, the organization's slogan is \"Nothing is fixed alone. Participate.\" \"We are looking at a compromised future,\" Meza said. \"We don't talk about that. We don't have the money to generate work here.\" One bright spot: U.S. investment is making a comeback. American companies Delphi, Honeywell, Flextronics and Lear are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in Juarez over the last year. That hiring would have been hard to imagine four years ago. But with the average salary at $20 per week for local workers in the maquiladores, or factories, along the U.S.-Mexico border in Juarez, Meza says more needs to be done. The scars from the recent past remain. Several buildings downtown are shuttered and marred by graffiti. Americans who, before the violence, came to Juarez for bargain shopping have not returned in the numbers seen before the spike in violence. But in a sign of progress, the U.S. State Department amended its travel warning for the city. While it still urges visitors to exercise appropriate caution, it's no longer telling people not to come. Longtime residents of Juarez and neighboring El Paso may be reluctant to say the wounds of the violent past have altogether healed. In the last year, however, they have definitely noticed that \"life is back.\" \"I measure it by the everyday coming and going of people,\" Gustavo Reveles, 39, told CNN. \"For someone who grew up on the border and for someone who spent half of his life crossing the border on a weekly basis, it's encouraging to be crossing back to Juarez without that sort of hesitation or worry that something might happen.\" Reveles lived in Juarez until he was 15 and now lives in El Paso. He says the threat of violence is \"still a little bit concerning,\" though that hasn't stopped him in recent weeks from going to Juarez to meet friends for dinner and drinks. \"Things have changed,\" he said. \"To go through what Juarez went through, you see life there again. You see a semblance of what was there before. To really recover and heal wounds, there's a long way to go, but the process has started and that's a step in the right direction.\" CNNMoney's Octavio Blanco contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 174 words:\nIn a tragic echo of the catastrophic events in Haiti in 2010, a powerful earthquake struck one of the poorest nations on Earth today. The latest estimates from seismologists put the magnitude at 7.9, which would actually makes it about 40% larger than the 7.8 currently being reported. That's less than half the size of the previous major event nearby in 1934, which killed around 10,000 people. Unfortunately, it is quite possible the number of dead in Kathmandu could rise to match it. We knew this disaster was coming eventually. Geophysicists have long monitored how fast the Earth's plates are moving, and we know that the entire subcontinent of India is being driven slowly but surely underneath Nepal and Tibet at a speed of around 1.8 inches per year. It's the reason Everest exists. Latest updates on Nepal earthquake. Over millions of years, the squeezing has crushed the Himalayas like a concertina, raising mountains to heights of several miles and triggering earthquakes on a regular basis from Pakistan to Burma. Saturday's quake was neither unusual nor unexpected, although it was larger than most. In the 81 years since the 1934 Bihar earthquake, the land mass of India has been pushed about 12 feet into Nepal. Think of all that movement getting stored in a giant spring lying under Nepal. The spring is stuck on a broad, rough surface which we call a fault plane (a fault line is what we see when it emerges from the ground). Fallen: Nepal's historic landmarks. Sometimes, energy stored in the spring gets big enough to slip catastrophically, releasing all that pent-up strain and generating shaking strong enough to destroy buildings and kill people over a huge area. The bigger the area that slips, and the larger the pent-up energy, the greater the damage. Saturday's slip took place over an area about 1,000 to 2,000 square miles over a zone spanning the cities of Kathmandu and Pokhara in one direction, and almost the entire Himalaya mountain width in the other. A part of India slid about one to 10 feet northwards and underneath Nepal in a matter of seconds. We have this kind of detailed data thanks to major advances in seismology over recent years. Using measurements of shaking recorded on seismometers scattered across the world and sent in near or real time to agencies like the U.S. Geological Survey and to universities such as Columbia, we can infer the location and magnitude of a big earthquake very quickly. Avalanches hamper Everest rescue efforts. Not just that: we can now estimate the pattern and speed of rapid sliding across its fault surface. What used to take months of careful academic study now takes minutes of computation. In Haiti in 2010, although the earthquake was more than 20 times weaker than Saturday's, well over 100,000 people are thought to have been killed around Port-au-Prince by the shaking and its after-effects. Yet despite some differences, the Nepal and Haiti earthquakes also share similarities -- both geological events were known to be approaching, and both struck areas afflicted by widespread poverty, rapid increases in population in urban areas, uncoordinated changes in building infrastructure and lack of adherence to improved building codes. About 1.45 million people live in  Kathmandu, the majority in poorly constructed homes not designed to withstand the kind of shaking seen on Saturday. Nepal has a per capita income of around $1,350, only a notch above that of Haiti, and among the lowest in the world. Meeting building codes in new construction, or taking on expensive retrofitting, is way beyond the means of most. To make matters worse, the valley itself appears to focus the destructive shaking of earthquake waves. Studies have long predicted that the Kathmandu area was due a magnitude-8 earthquake, or higher -- one study predicted between 21,000 and 42,000 fatalities if a magnitude-8.1 earthquake had struck the area. (Fortunately, Saturday's shaking was half that intensity). Still, this catastrophe comes at a delicate time for Nepal as it emerges from a long-running civil war and its economy has been improving steadily. We have to hope that recovery from both can somehow take place despite the enormous challenges ahead.\n\noutput:",

Lewis Hamilton took victory for the Silver Arrows at the Chinese Grand Prix -- only for his teammate Nico Rosberg to later claim he had ruined his race by driving slowly. The reigning world champion captured his 35th grand prix win with a peerless pole-to-flag win under Shanghai's sunny skies. \"It was great to have a smooth weekend,\" the British racer said before spraying the champagne on the podium. \"The team have done a fantastic job to up our pace and improve after our last race where we struggled a bit.\" F1 championship standings. Hamilton had lost the Malaysia Grand Prix in a strategic battle with the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel but it was business as usual in Shanghai. Rosberg came home second for Mercedes to snuff out the threat from the chasing Italian racers and renew his rivalry with Hamilton. \"It was an important comeback for the team,\" said the 2014 championship runner-up. Ferrari continued to put pressure on the world champion team with Vettel finishing third to collect his third straight podium of 2015. \"We just wanted to bring the podium back home,\" said Vettel, a four-time world champion with Red Bull Racing. \"It's been three out of three so far so it feels pretty good. I feel happy in the team and hopefully we can get a little bit closer to challenge these guys.\" Vettel is just 13 points behind Hamilton in the world championship and four points ahead of Rosberg, after the first three races of the year. Rosberg unhappy. It was a disheartening weekend for Rosberg -- the son of 1982 world champion Keke -- and he allowed his frustrations to spill over for the first time this season. On Saturday, Hamilton beat him to pole position by just 0.042 seconds and Rosberg complained to his engineers on the pit to car radio: \"Oh, come on guys!\" Then the German insisted his race was hampered when he found himself sandwiched between race leader Hamilton and Vettel, both of whom had stopped for fresh tyres a few laps earlier. \"Lewis is driving very slowly. Tell him to speed up,\" Rosberg told the Mercedes pit wall. Mercedes then instructed Hamilton on the team radio: \"OK Lewis we'd like to pick the pace up a little bit.\" Rosberg complained after the race that Hamilton's lackadaisical Sunday driving was holding him up, pushing him back into Vettel's thrall and taking life out of his tyres. \"It's interesting to hear from you Lewis about your pace up front,\" Rosberg said in the post-race media conference. \"That was compromising my race. Driving slowly, that was unnecessary, and meant Sebastian was closer to me. \"It cost me a lot of time ... I'm unhappy about that of course.\" Hamilton responded: \"It's not my job to look after Nico's race. It's my job to bring the car home. \"I didn't do anything intentionally to slow the cars down. If Nico had wanted to get by he could have tried, but he didn't.\" Bahrain. Hamilton has won two grands prix in 2015 while Rosberg has yet to climb onto the top step of the podium. If the German is to repeat his thrilling 2014 world title challenge, which went down to the final race in Abu Dhabi, he will need to turn things around soon. Rosberg has the chance to exorcise his frustrations on track at the Bahrain Grand Prix in just seven day's time. Ferrari will hope the hot track temperatures at the desert race will help them topple Mercedes again, as they did on Sepang's sizzling circuit. The Italian team have the horsepower. Vettel finished less than three seconds behind Hamilton in China with Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen fourth. There was also a small feat further down the field as former Ferrari race winner Fernando Alonso finished his first race for the McLaren Honda partnership with 12th place in China.

Y'know, living it up.\" Related: 9 worst eye care mistakes you're making. Macular degeneration is a breakdown of the part of the retina that allows us to see fine details in the center of vision; while glaucoma damages the nerve that connects the retina to the brain, and is often caused by fluid build-up and pressure in the eyes. (Barr said in the interview that she helps relieve the pressure by using marijuana, which is known to temporarily lower pressure inside the eye.) \"It's somewhat unusual that Roseanne Bar has both, but not unheard of,\" explains ophthalmologist Steven A. Shanbom, MD, of Shanbom Eye Specialists in Berkley, Mich. Though there are some controllable risk factors, certain people are genetically predisposed to these diseases, so Barr may simply be prone to both. \"Certainly it's sad. The combination of the two is terrible. Macular degeneration takes away her central vision, and glaucoma is taking away her peripheral vision,\" Dr. Shanbom adds. (He is not treating Roseanne Barr, and does not know the specifics of her case.) The risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60, with some people, especially African Americans, at higher risk in their 40s. That's why the American Academy of Opthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4-0, even if you have perfect vision. In the early stages, you can have either condition, but have no symptoms at all. Things like a family history or high blood pressure, or issues within the eye (like having a thinner cornea, for example) might lead your MD to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half. Related: 10 natural ways to lower blood pressure. There is no cure for either disease. But like those eyedrops, there are treatments that may delay the progression of early-stage glaucoma (from other drugs to surgery), and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration (including an implantable telescope). The future looks brighter however: An animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early-stage macular degeneration. There are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases. Here, five ways to protect your peepers. Slip on your shades—even when it's cloudy. Sun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration, as well as cataracts (clouding of the lenses). Make sure your sunglasses offer 99% to 100% UV protection. Sporting a pair that doesn't filter UV light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all, because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays. Schedule in a regular walk. Studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma, and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, all you need to do is raise your pulse 20% to 25% (which could mean a brisk walk) for 20 minutes, a minimum of four times a week. Related: 9 tweaks that make walking workouts more effective. Eat your greens. Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin—antioxidants that lower your risk of developing macular degeneration (and cataracts too), research shows. Another good source: egg yolks. Snack on almonds, citrus, and berries. Almonds are loaded with vitamin E (a handful provides about half your daily dose), which slows macular degeneration; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin C, which cuts your odds of developing the disease. Avoid cigarette smoke. While smoking is bad news for many parts of your body, you may not have considered eyes to be one of them. However, smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration. Avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart, it can protect your peepers too.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nJacob Lawrence's groundbreaking work, \"The Migration of the Negro,\" is a series of 60 small paintings with text depicting the lives of millions of pre-World War II blacks as they moved from the oppressive South to the promise of a better life in the North. One frame in particular, No. 22, shows three black men dressed in their Sunday best, handcuffed, heads bowed standing in front of a window adorned with prison bars. The caption reads:. \"Another of the social causes of the migrants' leaving was that at times they did not feel safe, or it was not the best thing to be found on the streets late at night. They were arrested on the slightest provocation.\" Lawrence painted this picture around 1940. This is important to know because there are some people who blame President Barack Obama for racial tension in America as if the March on Washington scrubbed away the lasting effects of 300 years of inequality. No. 22 was painted before hip-hop became the piñata for conservative talk show hosts to bash and before sagging pants became a popular fashion statement. Some of us keep looking for a new reason why this old problem continues to haunt us because to think otherwise requires effort. It's a lot easier to retweet a Dr. King meme. It is more convenient to say the violence began when rioters threw bricks at police and not when a city's Police Department began terrorizing its residents. We criticize Baltimore's mayor for not \"restoring order\" as if paying victims of police brutality nearly $6 million in a four-year span is \"order.\" Now, some people are partially blaming the 2013 movie \"The Purge\" for the uprising in Baltimore as if the 1996 riots in St. Petersburg, Florida, happened on a different planet. Or that the more than 100 cases of Baltimore police brutality that were either lost or settled out of court since 2011 provide no insight as to what the residents have been dealing with for some time. An 87-year-old grandmother had her shoulder broken by overzealous police, and Sen. Rand Paul -- God bless him -- suggested the rise in absentee fathers is the reason for this latest clash. It is true only 34% of black children live in a two-family household today, and I do believe that is a problem. Soul searching, as the President suggested, is something that needs to be had by all. But it is also true that 65% of black children lived with both parents in 1960, and yet there was still a lack of trust between the police and the minority community. Sen. Paul's rationale falls apart when you consider that John Henry Crawford III was shot and killed by police at a Walmart in Ohio while on the phone talking with the mother of his two children. Crawford's father was literally playing with his two grandchildren as his son was being gunned down. In 1971, Marvin Gaye cracked the Top 10 on the pop charts with \"Inner City Blues,\" which included the lines:. Crime is increasing. Trigger happy policing. Panic is spreading. God knows where we're heading. And yet so many look at the protests, uprisings and yes, sometimes riots, with this incredulous demeanor as if the raw emotions captured on camera are materializing out of thin air. No backdrop. No historical context. Television journalists asking questions that seem to characterize the recent developments as unexplained anger detached from any tangible issue. It is as if they believe the absence of burning crosses translated into peace and harmony. Meanwhile, Louisiana state police want people to believe Victor White III shot himself in the chest while handcuffed sitting in the back of a police car. How can there be peace when the Department of Justice found black residents in Ferguson were preyed upon for years by a corrupt Police Department? Where is the harmony when the average white household has 13 times the wealth of its black counterpart? And we know the impact wealth has on education, housing and mortality. Now there is video of police in Inkster, Michigan, celebrating the beating of a suspect as he sits nearby with broken ribs, a head injury and bleeding. The officers fist pump and laugh. One of them even appears to joyfully re-enact parts of the incident in plain view of Floyd Dent, the man in custody. And when the incident in question was under investigation, the Inkster Police Department suppressed the video. Two months would go by before the public saw what we are paying for. But at least we saw it. In Chicago, the police department has yet to release dash cam video of the fatal encounter officers had with 17-year-old Laquan McDonald last October. The report said an officer fired shots into McDonald's chest after the teen lunged at them with a knife. Witnesses said the shooting was unjustified. The autopsy shows McDonald was shot 16 times from a variety of angles by the officer. The City Council recently approved a $5 million settlement but maintains there was no wrongdoing. The video could shed some light on what really happened...which may explain why we have yet to see it. This comes on the heels of Mayor Rahm Emanuel establishing a $5.5 million reparations fund for victims of former CPD commander John Burge. For three decades Burge and his team ran a torture ring that used electric shock, burned and beat up more than 100 black men. And some look at Baltimore and the protests happening all around the country and wonder where all of this rage is coming from? This mistrust didn't come from somewhere. It's always been here. Woven in the comedic deliveries of Richard Pryor, Dick Gregory and Dave Chappelle; saturated within the prose of Lorraine Hansberry, Maya Angelou and Shonda Rhimes; heard in soulful cries of Billie Holiday's \"Strange Fruit\" to John Legend standing on an Oscar stage singing \"one day, when the glory comes it will be ours.\" For decades, the works of black artists have explicitly talked about the Baltimores of this country and though their work has been celebrated and curated, the message remains lost. Why else would someone believe sagging pants and hoodies are to blame for mass incarcerations? That President Obama is the reason why some blacks are frustrated with police and not the dynamic beautifully captured by Lawrence 75 years ago. Before President Richard Nixon started the war on drugs. Before Eric Garner started selling loose cigarettes in Staten Island. Before Baltimore became the setting of a critically acclaimed TV show. There isn't a new reason why Freddie Gray's death triggered outrage. Just new ways for people to validate apathy and explain away racism.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 183 words:\nThe number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana. The outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people. The CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources. Scott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March. Indiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles. So far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment. It's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles. Mermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections. The state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\" Many family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade. Another reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms. The other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection. Health leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said. \"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"\n\noutput:",

The as yet not titled eight-part, one-hour series is set to premiere July 26. Jenner, who along with his family has starred in the hit E! reality series \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" recently went public with the fact that he is transgender. Here are a few things we hope the new show will offer:. A closer look at Jenner's current relationship with his former wife. Fans of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" often got to see the sometimes strained relationship between Bruce and his wife Kris. As the Kardashian family matriarch who also manages her kids' careers, Kris butted heads with Bruce over everything from their children to his desire for more privacy. The pair announced they had filed for divorce in September 2014 after some time of living apart. There has been plenty of speculation regarding Kris Jenner's feelings about Bruce's transitioning though she tweeted her support after he made the announcement Friday during an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer. What role he will take in the transgender community. Before he was a realty television star, Jenner was a popular motivational speaker. He is already being hailed for bringing attention to the transgender community. \"Bruce is incredibly courageous and an inspiration, and we are proud to be entrusted with this deeply personal and important story,\" said Jeff Olde, executive vice president of programming and development for E! \"This series will present an unfiltered look as Bruce boldly steps into uncharted territory and is true to himself for the first time.\" According to E! Jennifer Finney Boylan, who is the national co-chair of GLAAD, will serve as a consultant on Jenner's series. \"Orange Is the New Black\" actress Laverne Cox, who is transgender, has also offered Jenner her support. \"I think a lot of people tuned in expecting to see a spectacle, and they tuned in and saw a profoundly nuanced, complicated, beautiful human being,\" Cox told MSNBC's Janet Mock. His relationship with his kids. Jenner is extremely close with his children. He has six biological kids with former wives Chrystie Scott, Linda Thompson, and Kris Jenner.  He also helped raise Kris Jenner's four children -- Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Robert Kardashian -- from her first marriage. \"Those are the ones I'm concerned with and the only ones I don't -- I can't allow, I can't let myself hurt them,\" Jenner told Sawyer during their interview about his fear in telling his children. Many of his kids appear supportive of his transition and his two youngest, daughter Kendall and Kylie, released the following statement to ABC about their father: \"We love our dad very much as he is an amazing father. We couldn't ask for a better dad. He has the biggest heart and all we want for him is to be happy. If he's happy, we're happy.\" How fans will react. Jenner has long been one of the world's most popular Olympic gold medalists. Viewers of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" often praised him for being so level-headed amidst all the paparazzi-fueled chaos. But with his new series Jenner will be taking center stage and venturing into completely new territory at a time when some still grapple with issues of gender and sexuality. He sounds like he is ready. \"We're going to make a difference in the world with what we're doing, and if the whole Kardashian show gave me a foothold into that world, to be able to go out there and do something good, I got not problem with that,\" Jenner told Sawyer.\n\noutput:",

Because of that, one's response to such imagery often becomes calloused or desensitized. This concept of \"how we digest images of war through mainstream media outlets,\" was what drove photographer Simon Brann Thorpe to begin his project \"Toy Soldiers.\" This idea to create a fresh perspective drove him into the desert of Western Sahara, a long-disputed region of northwestern Africa. Thorpe uses the area's harsh landscape as a powerful backdrop for soldiers posed as green plastic figurines -- similar to the popular toys that many children play with. The soldiers are with the Polisario Front, an independence movement that has been clashing with Morocco over the region since the mid-1970s. Thorpe said his project enables \"the creation of a visual metaphor from which a viewer develops their own emotional, physical and political response to war and conflict, when faced with the realization that the images do not contain toy soldiers but real soldiers.\" Thorpe's background was not in photojournalism, but in landscape photography, which lends to his powerful placement of the soldiers in the desert -- not to mention that all the locations chosen are historic locations of battles between Morocco and the Polisario Front. \"The conflict in Western Sahara receives virtually zero coverage despite 2015 being the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of war there,\" Thorpe said. After a ceasefire in 1991, the people of Western Sahara have been living in a state of non-resolution. The people are split into two camps -- those living in Moroccan-occupied territory, and those in refugee camps in Algeria. Social media.

Thorpe had to get clearance to work with the Polisario Front military and also had to be cautious of how many troops he moved about at one time -- otherwise he would have needed permission from the United Nations. He usually worked with about 50 or 60 soldiers at a time. The autumn months did not offer much reprieve from the long hours in the sweltering desert sun. Thorpe would work with the troops' commander to position the men, then climb atop sandy mountains with his wide-angle lens and capture these striking images. They would work till dusk and then spend the night under the stars. Not only were the soldiers willing participants for this project, but they also helped construct the platforms they stood on. Thorpe said they were made out of old oil drums. After the elaborate five-week production, Thorpe hopes his images will raise questions on \"how images of war (will) be consumed in the future with ever-diminishing attention spans and competition for them.\" Simon Brann Thorpe's \"Toy Soldiers\" book is available for pre-order through Dewi Lewis Publishing.

He had to obtain clearance and be cautious while working with troops, usually photographing about 50 or 60 at a time. The soldiers helped construct platforms for the shoots, made from old oil drums. Thorpe's images, available for pre-order in his book, aim to provoke questions on how future generations will consume images of war with diminishing attention spans. The conflict in Western Sahara, which began in 1975, has resulted in a divided population living in Moroccan-occupied territory and refugee camps in Algeria. Despite being the 40th anniversary of the war, it receives minimal coverage. Thorpe's project was a five-week production in the desert, with long hours under the sun.

Machete-wielding attackers hacking immigrants to death in major cities in South Africa. As attacks against foreigners and their businesses rage on, killing at least six people this week, other nations in the continent are scrambling to evacuate their citizens from South Africa.  But this is not the first time xenophobic violence has exploded in a country that  tries to portray itself as a diverse \"rainbow\" nation. They started after Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini said at a recent gathering that foreigners \"should pack their bags and go\" because they are taking jobs from citizens, local media reported. Shortly after his comments, violence against immigrants erupted in the port city of Durban. His office has denied he made the comments, saying  journalists misquoted him. While kings are mostly ceremonial figures in the nation, they are influential in their communities. But the United Nations said the attacks started in March after a labor dispute between citizens and foreign workers. Some citizens have accused African immigrants of taking their already scarce jobs, undermining businesses owned by locals and contributing to a high crime rate.  The nation's unemployment rate is about 25%, according to government figures. But resentment over porous borders, growing crime rates, poverty and corruption are also a major concern, analysts say. President Jacob Zuma has said his government is addressing the social and economic concerns. But he said immigrants contribute to the nation's economy and bring skills that are in demand, and should not be stereotyped as criminals. \"While some foreign nationals have been arrested for various crimes, it is misleading and wrong to label or regard all foreign nationals as being involved in crime in the country,\" Zuma said. The nation has about 2 million documented and undocumented immigrants, which is about 4% of the total population, according to a study by the University of the Witwatersrand. Zimbabweans make  up the largest  group of immigrants. Also, South Africa is a top travel destination for wealthy Africans because of its proximity and developed infrastructure. Yes. This is the latest in a series of attacks that date back years. In January, looters burned businesses owned by foreigners in another wave of xenophobic attacks. In addition, there were other incidents of violence last year, Human Rights Watch said. Seven years ago, Johannesburg was the epicenter of more anti-immigrant tensions that left dozens dead in attacks that later spread to Cape Town. Most of the victims were Zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances. In those attacks, police arrested more than 200 people on various charges, including rape, murder, robbery and theft. In 2006, xenophobic violence broke out again for several months in Cape Town. Victims of xenophobic attacks have been from various African nations, including Nigeria, Somalia and Ethiopia. African nations have condemned the attacks. Kenya, Malawi and Zimbabwe are just a few of the countries evacuating their citizens from South Africa. In Zambia, local radio station QFM said it will not play South African music in solidarity with the victims. And in Mozambique, South African energy and chemical giant Sasol sent about 340 South African nationals home. The company said Mozambican employees voiced concern about reported violence against their nationals and protested the presence of South African employees in Mozambique. Most of the attacks have erupted in poor and marginalized areas. Despite the progress the nation has made since its apartheid days, inequality still remains a major concern, according to the Nelson Mandela Foundation. \"It is up to the present and next generations to take up the cudgels where you (Mandela) have left off. It is up to them, through service to deepen our democracy; entrench and defend our constitution; eradicate poverty; eliminate inequality; fight corruption, and serve always with compassion, respect, integrity and tolerance,\" the foundation said in a statement. \"Xenophobia, racism and sexism must be fought with tenacity, wisdom and enlightenment.\" As fears of more attacks grow, South Africans have taken to social media and the streets to protest xenophobia and violence.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nWashington (CNN)Judge Jeffrey Sutton doesn't have a lot of company on the appeals courts these days. Sutton, who sits on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, penned the only recent appellate court decision to uphold state bans on same-sex marriage. His opinion, issued in November, goes up against an avalanche of judicial rulings striking down such bans. The split helped pave the way for the U.S. Supreme Court to take up a case on Tuesday that could ultimately decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have a constitutional right to marry. And it provides important insight into the legal arguments that could be made before the court by states seeking to uphold bans at a time when the national sentiment is quickly shifting in favor of same-sex marriage. \"It's an ideal piece of judicial craftsmanship,\" said Ryan T. Anderson of the Heritage Foundation, who believes that state bans on same-sex marriage are constitutional. Sutton \"more or less takes each and every argument that the other side has made, and then one by one by one, he explains why it doesn't work.\" Critics call the opinion an outlier and don't believe it will carry much weight, considering the number of courts that have overturned same-sex marriage bans in the nearly two years since the Supreme Court struck down the core of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. \"Judge Sutton's opinion stands alone,\" said Jon W. Davidson, legal director of Lambda Legal, a gay rights advocacy group. Sutton, 54, is the former state solicitor for Ohio, where he handled appeals for the state's attorney general. He clerked for Justices Antonin Scalia and Lewis Powell -- Scalia once called Sutton \"one of the very best law clerks I ever had.\" Appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, Sutton is considered a conservative jurist with a keen interest in states' rights. Here are the central arguments from his opinion that states seeking to uphold their same-sex marriage bans are expected to echo on Tuesday. It is \"dangerous and demeaning,\" Sutton wrote, to the citizenry to assume that only judges \"can fairly understand\" the arguments for and against same-sex marriage. \"Isn't the goal to create a culture in which a majority of citizens dignify and respect the rights of minority groups?\" he asked in the opinion joined by Judge Deborah L. Cook, also a Bush appointee. Critics such as Davidson have roundly condemned such reasoning. \"The people don't get to decide what the Constitution safeguards,\" Davidson said. \"They don't get to vote to violate the Constitution.\" Sutton pointed  to the drafters and their views of the 14th Amendment. \"Nobody in this case,\" he wrote, \"argues that the people who adopted the Fourteenth Amendment understood it to require the States to change the definition of marriage.\" It's an argument made to enforce the idea that there is no fundamental right to marriage for same-sex couples in the Constitution. \"From the founding of the Republic to 2003, every state defined marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman,\" he wrote, noting that the \"Fourteenth Amendment permits, though does not require, States to define marriage that way.\" He said that the same-sex marriage bans rationally advance a legitimate government policy. \"By creating a status (marriage) and by subsidizing it (e.g. with tax-filing privileges and deductions), the States created an incentive for two people who procreate together to stay together for purposes of rearing offspring.\" He said that states should not be accused of \"irrationality,\" but only the awareness that same-sex couples don't have children in the same way as couples of the opposite sex. Sutton pushes back on any suggestion that those who oppose same-sex marriage have negative feelings about gay and lesbian couples. He said that ballot initiatives banning same sex-marriage were not driven by hostility but were passed by \"real people who teach our children, create our jobs, and defend our shores.\" Gene Schaerr, a Washington appellate lawyer who help to defend Utah's ban on same-sex marriage, calls Sutton's opinion a road map for whoever might write an opinion supporting state bans. \"He's very much willing both in the result and in his analysis to leave the issue to the people without suggesting an answer one way or another,\" Schaerr said. But attached to Sutton's opinion was a harsh dissent from a third member of the three-judge panel that heard the case in the 6th Circuit. Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey, a Bill Clinton appointee, dismissed the opinion as an \"engrossing TED talk\" and a \"largely irrelevant discourse on democracy and federalism.\" Daughtrey said that Sutton failed to see the plaintiffs as individuals \"suffering actual harm.\" \"These plaintiffs are not political zealots trying to push reform on their fellow citizens, \" she wrote, but committed same-sex couples seeking equal status. Her harshest language was for Sutton's premise that the decision should be left to the democratic process. \"If we in the judiciary do not have the authority, and indeed the responsibility, to right fundamental wrongs left excused by a majority of the electorate, our whole intricate, constitutional system of checks and balances, as well as the oaths to which we swore, prove to be nothing but shams.\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nTuesday, April 14, is Equal Pay Day. Here's the announcement presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should make:. \"Today in America, women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn.  And the gap is even greater for women of color. That's unconscionable.  As president, my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100% of the population is paid 100% of what they're worth.  And so, I'm announcing that if elected president, I will take a 23% pay cut, equivalent to the current gender wage gap, to stand in solidarity with working women in America. And I won't take a raise until every woman in America gets a raise, too.\" April 14 wasn't just chosen at random as Equal Pay Day. It's based on a calculation: For women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014, they'd have to work until April 14, 2015. A woman on average loses $431,000 in pay over the course of a 40-year career. Merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty.  And at a time where Republicans are still, bizarrely, trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy, closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights. So here's the perfect opportunity for Hillary Clinton to put her money where her mouth is, literally. In her campaign launch and personal rebrand, Clinton is clearly trying to portray herself as a woman of the people, a populist fighter for the middle class. \"Everyday Americans need a champion,\" Clinton said in her campaign launch video, \"and I want to be that champion.\" Clinton has deftly put her finger in the wind and sensed the winds of populism blowing through America. Indeed, the fact that many Democratic voters still clamor for a less pro-war, less pro-Wall Street, more Elizabeth Warren-like alternative to Clinton is an ever-present thorn in the otherwise blooming garden of Clinton's inevitability. Opinion: The myth of Equal Pay Day. With her video, Clinton has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism. But can a wealthy white woman who once sat on the board of Walmart, has already lived in the White House, collects six-figure speaking fees and doesn't seem to own a pair of jeans really inhabit the portrait of a populist fighter? This is where a good ol'-fashioned political stunt would come in handy.  And make no mistake about it, I'm recommending a political stunt. Let's call a spade a spade. Hillary Clinton is a very rich person. While she's certainly not the first rich person to run for president, her wealth -- and the related perception of being out of touch with ordinary Americans -- is an obstacle in her candidacy. The difference between the current standard presidential salary of $400,000 a year and the 77 cents-on-the-dollar version of that salary, or $308,000, is probably a drop in the bucket in Clinton's bank account at this point. And yet the symbolic power is profound. Because what Clinton would be reminding us is that across America, the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23% less than the aggregate salaries of all men. 78 cents on the dollar: The facts about the gender wage gap. Thanks to the hacked Sony emails, we saw that even top female stars and executives in Hollywood are paid less than their male counterparts. What more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary? Clinton wouldn't just be saying she stands with the working women of America, she'd be showing it. Is it offensive to suggest that the first female commander in chief should be paid 23% less than her male predecessors for doing exactly the same work?  Yes. And that's the point -- to use her status to highlight the offensive gender wage gap and what Clinton, as president, would do to fix it. Yes, such stunts are trite and theatrical.  They're also effective, especially in our increasingly short-attention-span, it-only-happened-if-you-can-tweet it, symbolism-over-substance culture. Politics used to be about clunky people (mostly men) debating complex policies. Now it's about polished memes and even more polished candidates. Policy (I hope) still matters, but we're as likely to debate a candidate's \"image\" as her or his \"substance.\" The truth is that stunts and theatrics are now part and parcel of politics, as they are in our culture in general. That doesn't mean they can't also serve a noble purpose, in highlighting important problems and inspiring solutions. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest. Clinton did an arguably brilliant thing in her campaign launch, framing her video and presidential bid as not about her but the American people. In fact, Clinton didn't even appear in the video until the very end -- it was all about middle-class Americans, working hard, trying to get by and get ahead. And then we see Hillary, who wants to help. Hillary Clinton can't change who she is, the baggage attached to her by both the right and the left, rightly or wrongly. But she can change what she does going forward, how she shows up and signifies herself as a voice not for the status quo and the establishment -- but for ordinary Americans who need change. If Clinton wins, her presidency will indeed be symbolic and historic. And it will be significant if she does something to change the lives of the 158 million women in America.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "On Tuesday, April 14, 2023, Equal Pay Day marks the point in the year when women's earnings catch up to men's earnings from the previous year. Hillary Clinton, as a presidential candidate, could announce her commitment to closing the gender wage gap by taking a 23% pay cut, equivalent to the current gender wage gap. This symbolic gesture would demonstrate her solidarity with working women in America. The gender wage gap results in women losing an average of $431,000 in pay over a 40-year career, and closing it would help lift half of working single mothers out of poverty. Clinton's announcement aligns with her campaign's populist message, aiming to position herself as a champion for everyday Americans. However, some critics question whether a wealthy white woman can truly embody the portrait of a populist fighter. Despite the controversy, a political stunt like this could effectively draw attention to the gender wage gap and inspire action to address it.",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 179 words:\nJust before writing this column, I reached into the depths of my wallet, and in between the pilot licenses, I slid out a postage stamp-size certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration. The certificate documents my successful completion of the DC Special Flight Rules Area, or SFRA, online course. The online course verifies that I am knowledgeable to fly a plane under visual flight rules into the most highly restricted U.S. airspace in the country. Although a \"no-fly zone\" over the White House has long existed, the SFRA airspace was developed to protect the Washington area further after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The size of the SFRA airspace is designed to be large enough to give our defense forces enough time to determine if a threat exists from an aircraft entering it, an opportunity to identify the threat, and if necessary, to divert or eliminate it. An airspeed restriction begins at a 60-mile radius from the center of Reagan National Airport. At the 30-mile radius, all aircraft must file a flight plan that identifies itself to air traffic control via a specific four-digit transponder code (a transponder is an electronic communication device that identifies a specific airplane on an air traffic controller's display screen to indicate authorization for the flight). Aircraft must enter the SFRA through specific flight \"gates\" that are displayed on a standard aviation map. Aircraft on instrument flight rule flight plans, which include all airline operations, are not required to comply with SFRA restrictions. Air traffic control assumes the responsibility for the appropriate routing. As a matter of standard procedure, flights using an instrument flight rule flight plan have specific clearances with specific transponder codes, so the authorization for transit through the SFRA airspace is already built into the system. Why do I carry the certificate as an airline pilot? I have had occasion to fly my own little airplane through the airspace on a visual flight rule flight plan. Pilot who landed gyrocopter blogged about why. Noncompliance with the airspace requirements, or worse, no communication at all, carries some serious federal penalties, which could include the suspension or revocation of your pilot license. Being at the wrong end of an F-16 missile is also a possible penalty. So how does a flying machine that looks like a sophisticated lawn chair with helicopter blades invade such highly restricted airspace, as happened Wednesday, when a postal carrier from Florida landed a single-person aircraft on Capitol grounds? Well, I'm making an assumption based on the video footage, but it appears that this aircraft is classified by the FAA as a gyrocopter. A gyrocopter cannot quite launch straight up into the air in the manner of a typical helicopter; it requires a short ground run for takeoff. And most gyrocopters are kit-built aircraft. It also appears that this particular gyrocopter may weigh just under 255 pounds, which classifies it as an ultralight aircraft in FAA parlance. Why is weight significant? Below that weight, a license for the pilot or a license for the aircraft is not required. In addition, to remain in the classification, the maximum designed airspeed can't exceed 55 knots. Lawmaker looking into gyrocopter landing as pilot goes to court. A facility tracking the movement of this particular gyrocopter on radar would witness a speed probably attainable by the average Canadian goose. And the radar reflection on a piece of machinery of that diminutive size is most likely very limited. If it was actually tracked on a radar screen, the target may have appeared to be a flock of birds. How much damage could this aircraft have inflicted had it been intended for nefarious purposes? Well, if it had been crashed into a building, I feel confident that the building would have been triumphant. If the intent had been to carry some sort of destructive device, the weapon would have had to be relatively small. The engine is not designed to carry more than one pilot. And lack of carry-on space is a definite issue. Not that a review of airspace security measures isn't in order, but I wouldn't be concerned that this event will become the next threat epidemic. As an airline pilot, I can say I am relatively confident that our nation's capital is secure from gyrocopter attacks orchestrated by misguided lunatics.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nHillary Clinton is now officially a candidate for president -- and the never ending Clinton story rumbles on. She has been a part of all our lives now for approaching a quarter of a century. She started as the first lady that the right loved to hate, then the deceived wife, next a senator, then a candidate for president in one of the most dynamic primaries in history and finally, a secretary of state. The Republicans have their aristocratic Bushes, the Democrats have their Clintons. And if Hillary or Jeb were to win two presidential terms, then in the 44 years from 1981 to 2025, 28 will have had a Clinton or a Bush in the White House. The great American republic now looks about as democratic as \"Game of Thrones.\" But even though Hillary Clinton has been around nearly my entire lifetime, The Economist may speak for many when it asks: \"What does Hillary stand for?\" There is a paradox she presents: She is by far the best-known presidential candidate across both parties and, for the moment, almost unchallenged within her own. Yet even though Diane Feinstein can assert confidently that Hillary \"doesn't 'need' (the White House). But she wants it\" -- the question unanswered is \"What for?\" And for liberals, who believe that government is there to do something, it's this lack of definition that is surely so disconcerting about Clinton. There are good grounds for a liberal primary challenge to Clinton. The economy has revived under Obama but, say critics, largely to the benefit of Wall Street and the super-rich. The riots in Ferguson, Missouri, were a painful reminder that the poor, particularly the nonwhite poor, have been left behind. Clinton's credentials as a fighter against inequality are mixed. It is true, as the Wall Street Times notes, that she has previously called for \"universal prekindergarten, equal pay for women, increases in the minimum wage, paid family leave, higher taxes on the wealthy and an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit for working-poor families.\" But she counts among her friends precisely those corporate people blamed by the Occupy crowd for the country's inequality. Clinton is now, wisely, trying to distance herself from the Clinton Foundation -- after all, its fundraising efforts among foreign interests are hardly the stuff of populist liberalism. Then there is her foreign policy record. Clinton voted in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War (though in her memoir last year, she backed away from the vote, writing that she \"got it wrong.\") As secretary of state, she is easily associated in the mind of the left with such controversies as the war in Syria, the crisis in Libya and the collapse of the Mubarak regime in Egypt. That some of these may have had little to do with her is beside the point. Clinton is going to have to spend a sizeable amount of time during the primaries explaining and defending the things that occurred while she was working for the Obama administration. Her personal ethics are on the agenda, too -- as demonstrated by the flap over her use of a private email account. These are the issues that her Democratic rivals are running on. In Iowa last week, both Jim Webb and Martin O'Malley attacked Wall Street, Webb adding that he had also opposed the Iraq War. Both men questioned the wisdom of Clintonian triangulation -- the idea that the White House can be won, and the country successfully governed, by always seeking the middle ground. Both men would be wise to focus on Iowa; to contrast a populist, folksy campaign with the distant, over-managed style of Clinton. And both would do well to tap into a feeling that it would be unhealthy, undemocratic and plain dull to let Hillary coast to the nomination without a proper challenge. Nevertheless, there is a strange contradiction between the constant assertions that Democrats want a race and the polling evidence that Clinton would beat anyone who tried to take her on. Why do liberals demand a conversation about policy if the only answer they can still come up with is Hillary? The explanation is that the Democratic Party is intellectually impoverished. We hear often of the GOP's problems, how out of touch with a changing electorate it is and how it is divided against itself. The Democrats' challenges, however, are just as substantial. They've just been masked by having a charismatic man in the White House dominating the national conversation. Obama was elected at one of the highest points of national Democratic popularity. But, since then, Democratic power has been whittled away in successive congressional and local elections -- leaving the party without significant representation in the Deep South and absent any mildly conservative support at all. Everything was staked on Obamacare, which was ambitious and noble venture but without an obvious second act to follow. Democrats have become about defending the honor and reputation of their president rather than proposing bold new reforms. And the mood of their base can be felt either in the violence in Missouri or the disaffected, hollow laughter of \"The Daily Show\" audience. Cynicism abounds. Who really imagines that Hillary Clinton is the kind of personality that can spark a renaissance of thinking or a rejuvenation of activism among liberals? To repeat the question: what is she exactly running for? If she has one trump card to play, however, it is reinvention. Recall that she started the 2008 primaries out as a moderate, play-it-safe frontrunner and ended them drinking beer in an Indiana bar -- reinvented, in the words of Barack Obama, as Annie Oakley. If there is little intellectualism left in liberalism, at least Hillary Clinton is clever. Which is why she remains an asset to her party.\n\noutput:",

With a political career spanning over two decades, Clinton has been a first lady, a senator, a presidential candidate, and a secretary of state. The Economist raises the question of what Clinton stands for, as she is both well-known and unchallenged within her party. Critics argue that her record on economic inequality is mixed, with some accusing her of prioritizing the interests of Wall Street and the wealthy. Her foreign policy record, including her vote for the Iraq War and her tenure as secretary of state, is also a point of contention for some Democrats. Clinton's use of a private email account during her time as secretary of state has also become an issue. Her Democratic rivals, such as Jim Webb and Martin O'Malley, have attacked her on these issues and called for a more populist, folksy campaign. Despite this, polls show that Clinton would beat any potential challenger in the primaries. Some argue that the Democratic Party is intellectually impoverished and in need of a bold new reform, rather than simply defending the honor of their president.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nPresident Abraham Lincoln never lost his ardor for the United States to remain united during the Civil War. In his Second Inaugural address he attempted to salve the nation with an eloquent summation of his philosophy and plans for putting it into practice. \"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right,\" he orated, \"let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations' wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\" The spirit of Lincoln's second inaugural was self-evident on April 9, 1865 -- 150 years ago -- when Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee dramatically surrendered his approximately 28,000 troops to Union General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Courthouse (McLean House) in Virginia.  Over 600,000 Americans -- Northerners and Southerners alike -- had perished in the bloody Civil War.  But the carnage was now about to end. The historic meeting between Grant and Lee began with pleasantries about the weather and their mutual service in the Mexican War.  The good fellowship was palpable.  Lee, in fact, had to abruptly remind the chatty Grant about the diplomatic business at hand.   After all, they were at Appomattox Courthouse to hash out terms of surrender. Grant purposely ended up being generous to Confederate soldiers. They would be paroled, not condemned to prison camps.  Rebel officers were even allowed to maintain their sidearms.  Personal property of Southerners would now be respected.  Even rations were provided by Grant for Lee's hungry soldiers. It was Palm Sunday and in the spirit of Christian reconciliation Grant ordered that no celebration occur within Union Army ranks.  \"The Confederates were now our prisoners,\" Grant wrote, \"and we did not want to exult over their downfall.\" The myth-making about Appomattox started from the moment Lee left the courthouse on his horse to travel to Richmond.   Surrendering hadn't been easy for Lee.  Sullen from defeat, his own family property in Arlington had been confiscated by Union forces (converted into a Union cemetery with lines of white crosses on the lawn). All 11,000 acres of his Virginia land holdings had been stripped from him by the U.S. government.  With no real home, Lee rode to Richmond, depressed and destitute, rendezvousing with his sick wife Mary Curtis Lee at a spare apartment.  Remarkably, the stoic Lee didn't express bitterness in public. When news reached Lee that Lincoln had been murdered, in fact, he was distraught, calling it \"a crime\" that was \"unexampled\" and \"deplorable.\" Although much remained unresolved between the victors and vanquished, the little courthouse became a symbol of unity, just like the \"Star Spangled Banner\" from the War of 1812. One post-Appomattox story that has long interested me was that of Littleberry Walker.  After being present at Lee's dramatic surrender at Appomattox, Walker, a battle-fatigued Confederate, laid down his rifle and journeyed back to red-clay, Georgia, traveling mainly on foot, passing ragged clusters of Rebel amputees, many hobbling on bayonet crutches, others with arms or heads swathed in bandages and all heading in the same direction: home. Upon arriving in Atlanta, a weary Walker found the Confederate railroad-city smoldered in ruin, the handiwork of Gen. William T. Sherman's \"scorched earth policy.\"  (One-hundred-twenty years later, Walker's great-grandson, 39th President Jimmy Carter, would construct his Carter Center, an NGO dedicated to diplomatically resolving global conflicts, on the very hilltop overlooking Atlanta on which Gen. Sherman once stood.) Upon leaving Atlanta, Walker continued walking south, anxious for his kinfolk.  Unfortunately, he returned to Sumter County only to learn that his father had died and that the family farm was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. One suspects Inman, the main character of novelist Charles Frazier's \"Cold Mountain,\" spoke for the battle-hardened Civil War veterans like Walker, when he lamented that, \"What you have lost will not be returned to you.  It will always be lost.  You're left with only your scars to mark the void.  All you can do is go on or not.  But if you go on, it's knowing you carry scars with you.\" As we reflect on the sesquicentennial of Lee's surrender at that forlorn Virginia courthouse, today marvelously maintained by the National Park Service, we recognize that the scars of the Civil War are still with us.  The Mason-Dixon Line divide still exists.  Almost all the old Confederate States are now considered \"Red\" (Republican), while the Union States are \"blue\" (Democrat) -- a residual variation of Big Federal Government versus States' Rights paradigm of the Civil War era. While the old spiritual \"Slavery Chain Done Broke at Last\" was sung by blacks in the hours following the Appomattox surrender, racism sadly continues to be a crippling national scourge. While there no longer are beatings in Congress (like in 1856 when Preston Brooks of South Carolina caned Charles Sumner of Massachusetts on the Congressional floor) the gridlock on Capital Hill in 2015, the inability to get anything done, is similarly cold-cocking the spirit of our participatory democracy. All American eyes should be fixated on Appomattox today.  The McLean house is our collective sanctuary of national healing.  As a public place, the McLean parlor remains small but the legacy which Grant and Lee made at the truce table is timeless in world history. For while the scars of the monstrous Civil War still remain, the wounds have closed since 1865, in large part, because of the civility of Grant and Lee.  With grace and dignity, these brave West Point generals gave righteous credence to Lincoln's \"with malice toward none\" finery.\n\noutput:",

Grant showed leniency towards Confederate soldiers, allowing them to be paroled instead of imprisoned and even providing them with rations. Lee, who had lost his family property and was distraught over Lincoln's assassination, surrendered reluctantly. The scars of the Civil War still exist today, with the Mason-Dixon Line divide still relevant in American politics.

Established on the birthday of the American founding father, Liberland -- the world's newest micronation -- is founded on a firm belief in liberty and noninterference from the powers-that-be. A tiny, 7 square-kilometer parcel of land, marked on maps as Gornja Siga, its territory abuts the Danube on the border between Serbia and Croatia. The victim of a border dispute between Serbia and Croatia, it is claimed by neither side -- effectively a no-man's land. No one lives on this patch of land, which is heavily forested and contains only badly-maintained access roads and a run-down house, abandoned for decades. This is where Euroskeptic Czech politician Vit Jedlicka stepped in. On April 13 he planted his newly-designed yellow and black flag in the territory, declaring the area the Free Republic of Liberland -- a tiny sliver of a country, bigger only than the Vatican and Monaco. He tells CNN that the country will be formally founded on May 1 and is inviting, through the media, the world's heads of state to attend a formal ceremony marking the presumptive nation's birth. He says that he will also invite 7,500 of the 300,000 applicants that applied to become citizens of Liberland to the ceremony, where he will grant them citizenship. \"I will grant citizenship if they can make it to the party,\" he told CNN by phone. \"It's short notice but a good challenge, and also for  the presidents (and other heads of state) if they can make it to the founding of our country.\" Jedlicka, an active member of the Czech Republic's Party of Free Citizens, opposes excessive government interference. He says his attempts to enact change in his home country led him to the political experiment that is Liberland. \"I would describe it as a global revolution. It's just the beginning,\" he tells CNN via Skype. Founded on staunchly libertarian principles -- its motto is \"To live and let live\" -- its website describes its system of governance as being a \"constitutional republic with elements of direct democracy.\" It will use a form of cryptocurrency -- similar to Bitcoin -- as its national currency, bypassing the need for a central bank and will, according to its constitution, keep government's noses out of everything possible, from the banks to prostitution. \"Liberland prides itself on personal and economic freedom of its people, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, which significantly limits the power of politicians so they could not interfere too much in the freedoms of the Liberland nation,\" the world's newest constitutional document states. Financial regulation will be minimal, if at all present. Jedlicka says almost 300,000 applications for citizenship have been received, about 20 of which have been accepted. \"Thousands of Americans, Swiss people. Also a lot of Arabic peoples who feel oppressed by the regimes there.\" He envisions, ultimately, a community of around 35,000 Liberlanders, not all of whom will be full-time residents. He says he expects trouble from his neighbors, whose land he has effectively annexed. \"From Serbia, Croatia, we expect some trouble but we expect international laws will applied and any movement against us would be an attack on a sovereign nation, and we will offer nothing but passive resistance. For now, (though) we will make roads, docks.\" For its part, the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement to CNN that stated that Liberland would not theoretically impinge upon its border, which is delineated by the Danube, but \"the Ministry also considers this a frivolous act which needs no further comment.\" Croatia's counterpart was similarly dismissive. \"Virtual quips, however interesting they occasionally sound, remain what they are -- virtual quips, and for them we have no official comment.\"\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nThe shootings' main similarity is that the officer was white and the victim was black and unarmed. Outside of that, the highly publicized police shootings in Ferguson and North Charleston bear only mild resemblance. So what's changed between the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August, and that of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend? And did the backlash and publicity of the Ferguson shooting influence the handling of the North Charleston incident? It's tough to say for sure, but here are some of the stark differences in the cases, the lessons learned by both police and the public, and concrete changes that could help mend tensions in the future. Ferguson: Officer Darren Wilson said he shot Brown after the two struggled over Wilson's gun, and witnesses to the shooting had different accounts -- often conflicting -- of where Wilson was, where Brown was and whether Brown was surrendering or charging the officer. North Charleston: Though it's unclear what happened in the moments before a bystander began recording the incident on his phone, it's 100% clear from the video that Scott was not posing a threat to Officer Michael Slager when the policeman opened fire on Scott as he ran away. Takeaway: Where Brown's killing was a breeding ground for speculation -- with a stark divide between those who said Wilson was justified and those who said Brown was senselessly slain -- no such debate has emerged in the Scott shooting. It would be tough to extrapolate for certain, but it's possible that the clear-cut imagery of an officer shooting a fleeing man in the back resulted in the prompt charges against the officer, and that quick reaction by authorities in South Carolina after the video surfaced headed off the sort of violence that repeatedly unfolded in Ferguson as the process of determining Wilson's fate dragged on for months. Ferguson: Black residents outnumber whites in the St. Louis suburb by more than a 2-to-1 ratio, yet at the time of Brown's shooting, there were only three black officers on the city's 53-member force, and there was only one African-American member of the six-member City Council. (Two more African-Americans were voted in during this week's city's elections.) North Charleston: It's closer to an even split here, with census data from 2010 showing the city is 47% black and 42% white. The makeup of the city's police department is unclear, though it's been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80% black. Three of the 10 City Council members are black. Takeaway: The ratio of white and black officers on the North Charleston Police Department appears to more closely mirror the makeup of its population than does the Ferguson Police Department, but both are considerably off. As for the city councils, the latest election in Ferguson makes its governing body more representative than North Charleston's. But before you place too much emphasis on the percentages, there are other variables to consider, like policing methods, as CNN political commentator Marc Lamont Hill pointed out. Changing the racial makeup of a department alone won't do the trick if officers aren't taught the best practices. \"Black people didn't march and fight and struggle to have black officers kill us and black officers beat us and black officers harass us,\" he said. \"I want police officers who are capable of doing the job properly. We need community-based policing if we're going to believe that police are the proper force to be in our neighborhoods.\" Ferguson: There was no bystander video of Michael Brown's death -- no concrete evidence to support or refute different witness claims about what had transpired. North Charleston: It's unlikely Slager would have been fired and charged with murder so quickly if not for video shot by witness Feidin Santana. Even North Charleston's police chief said he was disgusted by the footage of Scott's shooting. Not only does the video show Slager firing eight shots at Scott as he's running away, it also shows him placing a dark-colored object next to Scott's lifeless body. That could be significant, because Slager initially said Scott had taken his Taser and he feared for his life. But if investigators determine the object dropped next to Scott's body was actually the Taser, Slager could be accused of planting evidence. The takeaway: Ferguson resident Alexis Templeton said what happened in her city helped people across the country to feel empowered to stand up for themselves. The video of the North Charleston shooting, she said, is vital. \"If there is no video, folks don't believe it because it sounds so asinine that something like this would ever happen in this country,\" she said. \"But with a video, you can't say it's not happening.\" Ferguson: The largely peaceful protests in Ferguson were marred by looting, arson and even shootings. Violence erupted again in November after Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, wasn't indicted. And even after Ferguson's police chief resigned last month, two officers were shot during a protest at the Ferguson Police Department. North Charleston: After Scott was killed in South Carolina over the weekend, protests in North Charleston have been peaceful so far. The takeaway: Some Ferguson residents say what happened in their city is playing a role in the way North Charleston is handling its own tragedy. Lee Smith, who recently made an unsuccessful bid for a Ferguson City Council seat, said he was glad to see authorities in South Carolina charge Slager with murder. \"I am hopeful that their motives are right and not just based on the fact that they are trying to avoid the same types of issues that came down in Ferguson,\" Smith said. Ferguson: It took Ferguson police six days to publicly identify Wilson as the officer who shot Brown, and in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, then-police chief Thomas Jackson decided not to visit Brown's family. And rather than charge Wilson and let a grand jury decide whether the charges had merit -- as many civil rights advocates wanted -- the prosecutor in the case instead made the unorthodox choice of presenting both sides himself and letting the grand jury decide whether to charge the officer. North Charleston: Slager was identified by authorities and charged with murder on Tuesday, two days after Santana shared his video with Scott's family. Mayor Keith Summey denounced the shooting and said Slager made a \"bad decision.\" Both Summey and the police chief also visited Scott's family. \"When you're wrong, you're wrong,\" he said. \"And if you make a bad decision -- don't care if you're behind the shield or just a citizen on the street -- you have to live by that decision.\" The takeaway: Former Ferguson Mayor Brian Fletcher said the city has influenced others. \"I think these situations are given much more scrutiny now,\" said Fletcher, who won a seat on Ferguson's city council this week. \"They have seen what has happened here in Ferguson. Every mayor and city council is very cautious in what they say and what they do.\" Ferguson: After Brown's death in August, many asked why Wilson didn't have a body camera. The shooting spurred a nationwide debate over whether officers should wear cameras on their lapels. Three months later, President Barack Obama pledged $263 million to procure body cameras and training for up to 50,000 police officers. North Charleston: Slager also was not wearing a body camera when he killed Scott. But after the shooting, the mayor said the city was ordering an additional 150 body cameras \"so every officer on the street\" in the city will have one. That's in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, Summey said. The takeaway: Not everyone agrees that all officers should wear body cameras. Some police unions have scoffed at the idea, and the American Civil Liberties Union has cited privacy concerns. They're also expensive. Several camera models cost at least $500 each, and storing all that footage can cost as much as $20,000 a year. But National Urban League President Marc Morial said more body cameras will help protect not just the public, but also police. \"I think if officers know that their actions are being recorded on a consistent basis, it's going to protect good officers who do the right thing,\" Morial said. \"But it's also going to ferret out, if you will, bad actions by bad officers.\" CNN's Moni Basu, Gregory Wallace and Wolf Blitzer contributed to the report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nBoston (CNN)After weeks of dramatic and emotionally wrenching testimony in the Boston Marathon bombing trial, jurors deliberated for more than seven hours Tuesday. But they haven't reached a verdict yet. The jurors sent out two questions, which are scheduled to be addressed when they return to court Wednesday morning. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 21-year-old accused Boston Marathon bomber, faces life in prison or the death penalty. On Monday, the jury saw a video of the moment a bomb exploded and disemboweled an 8-year-old boy and ripped the leg off his sister. The blast killed a 23-year-old graduate student from China. The jurors heard more horror from April 15, 2013. At one point, prosecutors played a video that showed the scene after a bomb exploded -- blood and injured victims everywhere and the sounds of a child howling. His mother lost her leg. \"The defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. \"The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahedeen, the holy warriors, so he chose Patriots' Day, Marathon Monday,\" a time for families to gather and watch the marathon. Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke tried to persuade jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. \"If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened,\" Clarke argued. Bomb survivors and victims' family members wiped away tears and comforted one another in court. Tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial. Bill Richard, father of bomb victim Martin Richard, 8, craned his neck to watch Tsarnaev as the prosecutor spoke. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \"chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston,\" Chakravarty said. \"He chose a day when there would be civilians on the sidewalks, and he targeted those civilians: men, women and children.\" The lawyer waited a beat. \"He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people.\" The prosecutor showed a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, in the marathon crowd. The day of the bombings, Chakravarty said, \"they felt they were soldiers. They were the mujahedeen and they were bringing their battle to Boston.\" Tsarnaev is accused of 30 counts, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. Seventeen of those counts carry a sentence of death or life imprisonment. If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a second phase, the so-called penalty phase. That part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors, and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from Tsarnaev's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. \"He was there,\" Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. Jurors were shown a photo of Tsarnaev standing by a tree behind the family of Martin Richard. \"These children weren't innocent to him,\" the prosecutor said. \"They were American. He knew what that bag was designed to do.\" Chakravarty quoted Martin's father who earlier testified, \"I guess we were just unlucky that day.\" But luck had nothing to do with the Boston bombings, the prosecutor said. \"This was a cold, intentional, terrorist act,\" he said. The brothers' acts that day were intended, he said, \"to make a point. To tell America, 'We won't be terrorized by you anymore. We will terrorize you.' \" The defense has maintained that Tsarnaev, who was 19 and flunking out of college at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, fell under the sway of his older, more radicalized brother. \"In the past few weeks, we have come face to face with tragedy, suffering and grief in dimensions none of us could imagine,\" Clarke said. \"We've heard words, we've heard screams and we've heard cries. For this suffering and pain, there is no excuse.\" She acknowledged her client participated in a \"senseless act.\" Tamerlan Tsarnaev, a Golden Gloves boxer, had hoped to wage jihad, and his slacker younger brother was just along for the ride, the defense has maintained. During the 15-minute rebuttal period, prosecutor William Weinreb told jurors not to be distracted by the defense's \"attempt to point the finger at somebody else.\" \"There should be no doubt in your mind that the defendant and his brother are equally guilty,\" he said. They were \"partners in crime.\" Weinreb pointed out that after the bombing, Tsarnaev went to the grocery store. \"Tamerlan Tsarnaev didn't turn his brother into a murderer. To shred the bodies of women and children with a homemade type of bomb, you have to be different from other people,\" the prosecutor said. \"If you are capable of such hate, such callousness that you can murder and maim 20 people and then drive to Whole Foods and buy some milk, can you really blame it on your brother?\" The radicalization of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. From the start, prosecutors presented a compelling case in which the horrors of April 15 to 19, 2013, were vividly brought to life once again. They began with the stories of bombing survivors and first responders, who described acts of courage and compassion amid madness and chaos. The final moments of the three Boston Marathon spectators who died were recounted by the people who were by their sides. According to testimony, Tamerlan Tsarnaev set off a bomb made from a 6-quart pressure cooker, explosive powder from fireworks, duct tape, nails and BBs on Boylston Street near the finish line. That bomb, which exploded near Marathon Sports, claimed the life of Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager. Twelve seconds later, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly detonated a second, similar bomb outside the Forum restaurant, slightly more than a block away. That blast killed the boy, Martin Richard, and Lingzi Lu, 23, a graduate student from China. Chakravarty's voice grew soft Monday as he recalled the victims:. Martin's 69-pound body \"was shattered, broken, eviscerated, burned. There wasn't a part of this boy's body that wasn't destroyed.\" Lu \"received blast injuries all over her body. Her leg was torn open, and she bled out.\" Campbell died in less than a minute from \"massive blast injuries to her lower extremities. Parts of her body were shredded.\" Sean Collier, the MIT campus police officer killed three days after the bombings, \"never had a chance.\" He was shot between the eyes. \"They assassinated him.\" The brothers allegedly killed the 26-year-old officer for his service weapon but couldn't pry it loose from a safety holster. Case ends with grisly photos and testimony. Dun Meng told the jury about his frightening 90 minutes with two carjackers, one who admitted being involved in the marathon bombing. He identified that person as Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Police fired 210 rounds at the brothers when they tracked a GPS device in Meng's stolen Mercedes and cornered them in Watertown, Massachusetts. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev struck Tamerlan, who was wounded, when he charged police in the car. Tamerlan died of his injuries. \"Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop,\" the prosecutor said Monday. \"He was ready for heaven. But the defendant had other plans.\" Dzhokhar ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry-docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in Watertown. As he hid, he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called a \"manifesto\" in which he said he was jealous of his brother for dying as a martyr and reaching paradise. He also lashed out at the United States for policies he said killed Muslims, writing, \"I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.\" Federal prosecutors also presented evidence gleaned from searches of the brothers' computers, including militant literature written by top al Qaeda leaders. And they traced the purchase of the pressure cookers, ammunition and BBs, which appeared to have been made by Tamerlan. Boston trial: What defense?\n\noutput:",

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 21-year-old accused bomber, faces life in prison or the death penalty. The jury heard emotional testimony about the bombings on April 15, 2013, which killed three people and injured over 260. Prosecutors argued that Tsarnaev, along with his older brother Tamerlan, intentionally targeted civilians during the marathon as an act of terrorism. Tsarnaev's defense attorney, Judy Clarke, argued that Tamerlan was the instigator and that Dzhokhar was only following his brother's lead. The trial includes testimony from bombing survivors and victims' family members, as well as evidence from the brothers' computers and the purchase of materials used to make the bombs. If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one capital offense, the trial will proceed to a second phase to determine whether he will receive the death penalty or life imprisonment. The defense strategy has been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life.

Italian authorities have arrested 15 people on suspicion of murdering the Christians at sea, police in Palermo, Sicily, said. Why migrants are dying to get to Italy. The original group of 105 people left Libya on Tuesday in a rubber boat. Sometime during the trip north across the Mediterranean Sea, the alleged assailants -- Muslims from the Ivory Coast, Mali and Senegal -- threw the 12 overboard, police said. Other people on the voyage told police that they themselves were spared \"because they strongly opposed the drowning attempt and formed a human chain,\" Palermo police said. The boat was intercepted by an Italian navy vessel, which transferred the passengers to a Panamanian-flagged ship. That ship docked in Palermo on Wednesday, after which the arrests were made, police said. 'I enter Europe or I die': Desperate migrants rescued this week off Italy. The 12 who died were from Nigeria and Ghana, police said. Thousands of people each year make the dangerous sea journey from North Africa to Europe's Mediterranean coast, often aboard vessels poorly equipped for the trip. Many of them attempt the voyage to flee war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. More than 10,000 people have arrived on Italian shores from Libya since last weekend alone, according to the Italian coast guard. Many die each year while attempting the voyage, often when boats capsized. Last year at least 3,200 died trying to make the trip. Since 2000, according to the International Organization for Migration, almost 22,000 people have died fleeing across the Mediterranean. The IOM reported Thursday the latest boat to sink in trying to make the journey. Only four people survived from the original 45 on board, bringing the estimated death toll so far this year close to a thousand.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 175 words:\nThe Arizona police officer who intentionally slammed his car into an armed suspect previously faced an excessive force lawsuit in New York, according to court documents. Officer Michael Rapiejko was with the New York Police Department from 2003 to 2006. Two years after he left, he was one of the defendants in a suit filed by a man who alleged that Rapiejko pointed a gun and threatened to shoot him and handcuffed and choked him in front of his family during a 2005 arrest. The lawsuit said Luis Colon had parked his car and gotten out when Rapiejko, with his gun aimed at Colon, ordered him back into the car. During his arrest on charges of obstructing governmental administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, Colon alleged he was yanked from the car, handcuffed and choked. The charges against Colon were dropped six months later. Colon also sued two unnamed officers who arrived after the initial confrontation, court documents show. Colon and the city settled the suit for $20,000. The settlement said the defendants were not admitting to any wrongdoing. Rapiejko had resigned voluntarily in 2006, and there is no indication of any disciplinary action against him from the NYPD, a senior law enforcement official told CNN. The NYPD has said that it will not release further details about Rapiejko. Rapiejko's actions in Marana, Arizona, in which he drove his patrol car into a man who had fired a rifle in the air minutes earlier and before that had pointed the gun at another officer, have stirred debate about what type of force police should have used. Authorities said no charges have been brought against the officer for the February incident. The suspect, 36-year-old Mario Valencia, survived and was hospitalized before being criminally charged. Marana police Chief Terry Rozema was asked Wednesday on CNN's \"New Day\" whether police were fortunate that Valencia didn't die. \"That very well may be ... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,\" Rozema said. \"So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,\" the chief added. In one of the dashcam videos, an officer who was tailing a walking Valencia at slow speed reports over the radio that the suspect has fired one round in the air with a rifle he is accused of stealing that morning from a nearby Walmart. Another patrol car zooms past, runs into the man from behind, then hits a short cinder block wall next to a driveway. Video from Rapiejko's camera shows the officer's vehicle running into Valencia, with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall. Police in Marana justified Rapiejko's actions. \"We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,\" Rozema said. \"And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?' \" Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, told CNN on Tuesday that \"it is miraculous that my client isn't dead.\" \"Everything in the video seems to point towards an obvious excessive use of force,\" Cohen-Metzger said. Tucson Police Sgt. Pete Dugan told CNN that Valencia was involved in several crimes there the day he was struck, including a stealing a car that he drove a half hour north to Marana. Valencia faces 15 charges, including three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. Cohen-Metzger said he had a prior record. His next court appearance is May 18. He is in the Pima County Jail. Marana police on Thursday told CNN's Miguel Marquez that a store gun lock was still on the rifle when it was recovered. The wire that goes through the trigger and the lever to reload the gun were loose enough to allow it to still be used, police said.

For most of those years, the money was deep at the bottom of the Atlantic, the monetary casualty of a cruel World War II sinking. In November 1942,  the unguarded SS City of Cairo was sunk by a German U-boat while carrying 296 civilians and cargo that included 100 tons of silver. The vessel sunk to more than 16,800 feet under the surface (5,150 meters) where it went undiscovered until 2011 when Deep Ocean Search decided to go looking for it. The sinking was the stuff of legend. The City of Cairo was bringing silver rupees from India to England as part of the war effort. After a stop in Brazil, two torpedos sank the ship in the Atlantic. After the ship went under, the U-boat reportedly surfaced and the captain said to the survivors in lifeboats: \"Goodnight, sorry for sinking you.\" The captain's lament is the title of a book about the event. Only a handful of people died as the ship sank but about 100 more passed away during the desperate attempt of the six boats to make it to land, which was hundreds of miles away. When the last of the lifeboats was found 51 days later, all but two people in it had died. Deep Ocean Search said in a news release that during the 2011 search it located an unnatural object on radar. A sub found the City of Cairo split into two parts, buried by silt. \"Under contract to the UK Ministry of Transport, DOS recovered several tens of tons of silver coins from a depth of (5,150 meters),\" the company said. The depth is a world record, the company claimed. Other deep-water operations reported in the media that are close to this depth include the 1987 search for the wreck of a South African Airways plane at 16,000 feet (4,700 meters) and the discovery of the SS Gairsoppa at about 15,400 feet (4,800 meters) in the North Atlantic in 2011. The BBC reported the City of Cairo salvage operation was completed in September 2013, but the British government made the company keep it secret until this week. The coins were melted and the silver sold, the BBC reported. Deep Ocean Search got a percentage of the sale, and the UK Treasury the rest, according to the BBC.

Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, told a handful of reporters that he had been given the information by the South Korean National Intelligence Service. CNN cannot independently confirm the executions. The nature of the intelligence supporting the National Intelligence Service allegations was also not immediately clear. North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world.

He considers those a challenge to his authority, the intelligence officials said, according to Shin. For example, a senior official with Ministry of Forestry was executed for expressing dissatisfaction with the country's forestry program, the lawmaker said. North Korean defectors share their ordeals. The vice chairman of the State Planning Commission was executed because he objected to changing the design of a science and technology hall from a rounded shape to one resembling a flower, the intelligence officials said, according to the lawmaker. And in March, according to the South Korean lawmaker, Kim executed on charges of espionage four members of the Unhasu Orchestra, including the general director, because of a scandal, Shin said. Kim became North Korea's Supreme Commander in December 2011 following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il. According to the National Intelligence Service, he is reported to have executed 17 senior officials in 2012, 10 in 2013 and 41 in 2014. The National Intelligence Service says there is a strong possibility that Kim will visit Russia, but given his nature, there is no way to be sure until the last minute. Why Putin is hosting Kim Jong Un. CNN's KJ Kwon reported from Seoul and Don Melvin wrote this report from London.\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reportedly executed about 15 senior officials this year, according to South Korean intelligence, including a vice chairman of the State Planning Commission for objecting to a building design and members of the Unhasu Orchestra for a scandal. Kim, who became supreme commander in 2011, is known for ruling with an iron fist and intolerance of dissent, executing at least 68 officials between 2012 and 2014, according to South Korean intelligence. Kim's potential visit to Russia remains uncertain.",

Evacuations in the region involved not only people but animals as well. \"There is more seismic activity ... and we think there will be more activity today,\" Helmuth Huerta, a spokesman for Chile's National Geological and Mining Service, told CNN. The volcano has already erupted twice this week, spewing ash to a depth of about 23½ inches (60 centimeters) in some places, according to the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety. New advisories say airborne ash could reach an altitude of 12,000 feet. Calbuco erupted twice in 24 hours, the geological agency said early Thursday. The agency said it was evaluating a spectacular nighttime eruption but indicated it was \"stronger than the first one.\" In Ensenada, houses, trees and even sheep were blanketed gray with ash, CNN's Shasta Darlington reported. People were removing salmon -- a staple of the local economy -- amid fear of contamination from ash and lava. Trucks were used to evacuate farm animals and pets. Authorities issued a red alert for the popular tourist towns of Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas in the south. People were being evacuated to Port Montt on 22 buses and military trucks, the interior ministry said. Officials said that volcanic flows from Calbuco caused rising water levels in the Río Blanco. A 12-mile (20-kilometer) exclusion zone was established around the crater. Military and police forces were helping evacuate more than 4,400 residents, the Interior Ministry said. An additional 2,000 residents of Chamiza were being evacuated as a preventive measure after river levels rose due to volcanic flows. More evacuations were expected in Lago Chapo and Correntoso. The first eruption on Wednesday set off a bit of a panic in the region. \"At the beginning, it was small, and later, the cloud grew. And later, there was a huge cloud over you and true terror starts,\" a Puerto Montt resident said. Another person said: \"It was impressive to see an enormous mushroom cloud, with the immense force of the volcano, and to see the ashes. At that point, there was a lot of panic, lots of chaos, traffic jams, people going to supermarkets, everyone looking for water, trying to take out money from the ATMs.\" Magma expanse under Yellowstone supervolcano more vast than thought. The eruption is a first for many in the region. The last major eruption was 1962. There was a minor eruption in 1972. Calbuco also belched out a bit of gas and smoke in 1996. Alejandro Verges, regional director of the Interior Ministry, said that officials are concerned there might be a third eruption. \"The situation is relatively calm right now, although people are understandably anxious about what could happen tonight,\" he said.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nIn 1944, 16-year-old Yong Soo Lee of Taegu, Korea, was lured by a friend of hers to meet with an older Japanese man. The man took the two of them, and three other teenage girls, by train, then ship, to Taiwan. There, the girls were forced into sexual slavery, serving four to five Japanese soldiers every day for a year. Lee suffered beatings and torture, was infected with a venereal disease, was fed paltry amounts of food, faced temperatures so cold that ice formed on her body, and was never allowed outside. Only the end of World War II brought her relief. Lee is just one example of the over 200,000 women from Korea, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, and other Asian nations, who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. These so-called \"comfort women\" suffered unimaginable physical, emotional, and psychological trauma. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addresses a Joint Meeting of Congress on Wednesday, he has an opportunity to do right by these women, and issue an unequivocal and irrefutable apology -- something that carries the weight of his government. In 2007, in the very same chamber the prime minister will be issuing his address, the House of Representatives sent a profound message to the Japanese government by unanimously passing House Resolution 121, which I authored. The resolution called on the Japanese government to formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its Imperial Armed Forces' coercion of young women into sexual slavery; publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the \"comfort women\" never occurred; and educate current and future generations about this horrible crime. We are still waiting for their government to comply. In 2006, during his first term, Prime Minister Abe unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he stated that there was no evidence of Japanese coercion and complicity in setting up and running the \"comfort women\" system. And during his second term, Abe and his right-wing allies have continued to question history -- even trying to dilute and rewrite it. Last year, I, along with 17 of my House colleagues, wrote to the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, calling the timing and contents of the Japanese government report on the 1993 Kono statement: regrettable, unfortunate, unacceptable, and destabilizing. Last year, meanwhile, the Abe administration tried (and failed) to get the United Nations to partially retract their authoritative 1996 report, which called on Japan to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to survivors who had been forced into sex slavery. Most notably, earlier this year, the Japanese government tried unsuccessfully to change passages in U.S. history textbooks about the \"comfort women.\" Some say that Japan has already apologized enough and it's time to move on. To those people I say, in light of these continued attempts to rewrite history, for every step forward the Japanese government takes toward peace and reconciliation, it takes two steps back. As someone who was put into an internment camp as an infant, I know firsthand that governments must not be ignorant of their pasts. In 1942, during World War II, my government put aside the constitutional rights of Japanese Americans and systematically incarcerated 120,000 of us. We were U.S. citizens, but merely because of our ancestry, the government treated us like the enemy. Decades later, we, the Japanese American community, fought for an apology from our government. In 1988, Congress passed, and President Ronald Reagan signed into law, the Civil Liberties Act, which was a formal apology to United States citizens of Japanese ancestry who were unjustly put into internment camps during World War II. Our government made a mistake, but they apologized for it, and healed many wounds as a result. Japan must now do the same. It must show the maturity of a democratic country, apologize for its mistake, and thereby gain the trust of her sister Asian nations. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Prime Minister Abe to face Japan's history. Germany knows something about this. After World War II, Germany engaged in a painful national \"coming to terms with the past\" that ripped open old wounds so that they could properly heal. Time is of the essence. Today, there are fewer than 100 surviving \"comfort women\" across the Asia-Pacific. Each year, this number declines. Ms. Lee is one of 53 remaining Korean survivors. The survivors are dying by the day. They deserve the justice and apology that has been due to them for the past 70 years. The opportunity to speak to a joint meeting of Congress is an honor that is reserved for heads of state of our closest allies. I will be in the House chamber when Prime Minister Abe delivers his address. Ms. Lee will attend as my guest. Both of us hope the Prime Minister will take the privilege of this opportunity and finally, and firmly, apologize, and commit to educating the future generation honestly and humbly. Ms. Lee and her sisters deserve no less.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 159 words:\nNobel literature laureate Guenter Grass, best known around the world for his novel \"The Tin Drum,\" has died, his publisher said Monday. He was 87. Grass died in a clinic in the city of Luebeck, where he was taken over the weekend, said Steidl publishing spokeswoman Claudia Glenewinkel. German media are reporting he died of pneumonia. Grass focused in much of his work on learning from the horror of war and genocide by exploring motifs from his childhood city of Danzig, which is now Gdansk, Poland. During the Nazi era, ethnic Poles and Jews were persecuted and deported from the multicultural city, at a time when they faced the possibility of mass murder. \"In his excavation of the past, Günter Grass goes deeper than most and he unearths the intertwined roots of good and evil,\" the Nobel committee wrote, when it awarded him the literature prize in 1999. But Grass, an outspoken public figure, has sparked controversy in the last decade. In 2006, he confessed that at the age of 15, in 1943, he volunteered for military service in Germany's war of aggression and ended up in the notoriously bloody Waffen SS. Grass said he had no excuses for his choices back then, and that, as a teen, he may even have been excited about belonging to the unit, which he saw then as an elite group. A year later, he penned a detailed account in The New Yorker on how he spent his war years up to the death of German dictator Adolf Hitler. Three years ago, Grass drew controversy again, when he published a poem in a German newspaper discouraging Germany from selling more submarines to Israel. In \"What must be said,\" Grass accused Germany of selling weapons to a potential aggressor out of guilt over the Holocaust. Grass said Israel could use nuclear weapons to kill masses of Iranians. German commentators pilloried him as subconsciously anti-Semitic. Israel invoked a visa ban, and then-Interior Minister Eli Yishai declared Grass a \"persona non grata\" in Israel, the Jerusalem Post reported. Grass' novel characters are the forgotten, the downtrodden and the weird, the Nobel committee said. And like Oskar Matzerath, the boy in \"The Tin Drum,\" they often slip into surreal situations. This was a literary innovation, the committee said, which was furthered by other great authors, such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Nadine Gordimer and Salman Rushdie. On Monday, Rushdie tweeted about Grass' death:  \"This is very sad. A true giant, inspiration, and friend.\" \"The Tin Drum,\" which was published in 1959, \"breaks the bounds of realism by having as its protagonist and narrator an infernal intelligence in the body of a three-year-old, a monster who overpowers the fellow human beings he approaches with the help of a toy drum,\" the Nobel committee wrote. The committee praised Grass' mastery of the German language and his ability to artfully exploit its possibilities of creating seemingly endless yet graceful sentences. Grass was an icon in contemporary German culture with an unchanging iconic look -- his broad mustache, his eyes gazing over the top of his glasses, a tobacco pipe a constant companion in hand. In his later years, he became known for his continuing critique of human history in the 20th century -- and of current events. As recently as March, Grass criticized the anti-Islam movement PEGIDA, Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West. He used the opportunity fire a jab at government that he said was corrupted by money interests. \"It's not Islam that threatens the Federal Republic (of Germany),\" he said in an interview with rp-online.de, \"but political lobbying. Democracy has decayed into fake democracy.\" Grass has also suggested that Germans should be forced to invite refugees from crisis regions to live in their homes as a way of offering more shelter to the world's destitute.\n\noutput:",

Follow the latest coverage of Nepal earthquake. Whole streets and squares in the capital of more than 1 million people were covered in rubble. Stunned residents stared at temples that were once part of their daily lives and now were reduced to nothing. Locals and tourists ferreted through mounds of debris in search of survivors. Cheers rose from the piles when people were found alive -- but mostly bodies turned up. The injured ended up being treated outside overflowing hospitals, where crowds of people gathered looking for relatives. Dozens of bodies were pulled from the historic nine-story Dharahara tower that came crashing down during the quake. At least 17 people were reported killed on Mount Everest, where the quake caused multiple avalanches. A seemingly endless series of aftershocks continued to roil the area, further traumatizing survivors. Residents huddled in the cold rain overnight for safety. The death toll of 1,832 is expected to rise as the full extent of the damage is assessed. The loss of life reported so far \"is really based on the information we have from the main cities,\" Lex Kassenberg, Nepal country director for CARE International, told CNN.  \"But if you look at the spread of the earthquake a lot of the rural areas have been hit as well. The information we received from the field is that 80% of the houses in these rural areas have been destroyed.\" The quake was the strongest in the region in more than 80 years. Residents are used to earthquakes in Nepal, and many thought the start of Saturday's quake was a tremor, until the earth kept shaking and buildings crashed down. \"The reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed, injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise,\" said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a statement. \"It is clear that very many lives have been lost.\" An estimated 4.6 million people in the region were exposed to tremors from the Nepal earthquake, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said via Twitter. Thirty out of 75 Nepal districts were affected by the quake. In neighboring Tibet, roads buckled, buildings collapsed and at least 13 people were killed, China's state media reported, citing local authorities. Separately, at least four Chinese citizens in Nepal -- two workers with a Chinese company, a tourist and a mountaineer -- have been killed, state media reported, citing the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu. Officials in India confirmed at least 34 deaths in three states from the Nepal quake. The quake struck at 11:56 a.m. local time (2:11 a.m. ET)  and was centered less than 50 miles northwest of Kathmandu. It occurred at a depth of 9.3 miles, which is considered shallow and more damaging than a deeper quake. It was reported by people in the area as having lasted a long time. One person said he felt as if he were on a ship in rough seas. Kathmandu sits in a valley surrounded by the Himalayas. Siobhan Heanue, a reporter with ABC News Australia, told CNN she was wandering at an ancient temple complex at the moment of the earthquake. Several temples collapsed around her, she said. \"It's not too often you find yourself in a situation where you have to run for your life,\" Heanue said, adding that she sought shelter under the table of a cafe. \"It was utterly terrifying.\" Heanue watched as residents picked through the rubble of a destroyed temple. They found 12 bodies. \"Unfortunately, that search was not fruitful,\" Heanue said. \"There were 12 bodies at least pulled from the rubble in the square. This was just one of several historical temple complexes severely affected by the earthquake.\" The Dharahara tower, the landmark nine-story structure, was packed with people when it collapsed.  Heanue said at least 50 bodies were pulled from the ruins of Dharahara. The tower, built in 1832, provided visitors with a panoramic view of the Kathmandu Valley. Are you in Nepal or have loved ones affected? Please share with us if you are in a safe place. Kanak Masni, a journalist in Kathmandu, told CNN by telephone that this appeared to be \"the most massive earthquake to hit central Nepal since 1934.\" In that quake, which was 8.1 magnitude and centered near Mount Everest, more than 10,000 people were killed. Thomas Nybo, a freelance photographer, was sitting in a coffee shop in Kathmandu's Thamel district. It appeared to be a minor tremor at first but gradually gained intensity, he told CNN. Thousands poured onto the streets of the densely populated tourist hub. \"This region is no stranger to earthquakes,\" he said. \"A lot of people had the same feeling: This is a tremor, it passed. When that wasn't the case, they were in uncharted territory... It's basically an unwritten book.\" Outside the coffee shop, Nybo said he saw a group of women gather near what had been a six-story building. One woman said children were trapped beneath rubble. \"We ran over and ran around the rubble and couldn't hear anything,\" he said. \"There was no chance that they survived.\" Nearby, another building had come down on an area where locals went to do laundry and collect water, Nybo said. A voice was heard coming from the rubble. \"A group of mainly tourists started gathering rocks, hammers and pickaxes and breaking through a re-enforced concrete wall to reach this guy... It took about two hours of smashing through wall and cutting rebar with a hacksaw to pull him out alive.\" Two bodies were found near the spot where the man was rescued, Nybo said. Not far away, lay the bodies of three or four women. \"Who knows how many other bodies lie beneath the rubble?\" he said. The streets of Kathmandu were packed with thousands of locals and tourists who didn't want to go back to their homes or hotels because of recurring aftershocks. Rob Stiles and his wife had just checked into a hotel in Kathmandu when the earthquake struck. \"It felt like it went on forever,\" the California resident said. Witnesses: \"People are panicked, running down to street\" Outside, people ran onto the street, with the temblor knocking some off their feet. A huge section of a brick wall crushed motorcycles and a car. Later, as they walked around the city, an aftershock hit. \"People were screaming and looking around,\" he said. \"There were people clearly shaken, upset, crying.\" Denis McClean, spokesman for the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, told CNN that weak building codes in Nepal contributed to the amount of structural damage. \"Building codes in Kathmandu itself have not been well upheld in recent years,\" he said. \"Efforts have been made over the last few years to strengthen these building codes but, unfortunately, this comes too late for the many thousands of buildings that have gone up across the Kathmandu Valley over the last 20 years that did not adhere to the building codes.\" Chitra Thapa, 48, a CNN security guard in Atlanta, said he spoke by telephone with relatives in Kathmandu and Pokhara, a city about 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of the capital. They were fine and were staying on streets. \"Everybody's in shock,\" he said. \"They never felt an earthquake that big.\" Aid agencies expressed concern for the welfare of survivors in the coming days, as overnight temperatures were expected to drop and people were forced to make do without electricity, running water and shelter. The international community must react quickly to save lives -- particularly those of children -- said Devendra Tak, of the aid agency Save the Children. \"With every minute the situation becomes worse,\" he said. Food, clothing and medicine will be urgently required, Tak said. The U.S. government is providing $1 million in immediate assistance to Nepal, the U.S. Embassy in Nepal said. American disaster response teams are also on their way to Nepal, the Embassy said via Twitter. \"To the people in Nepal and the region affected by this tragedy we send our heartfelt sympathies,\" Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. \"The United States stands with you during this difficult time. How to help the earthquake victims. At a hospital in the Nepalese capital, people with broken bones and head injuries were lying outside, with doctors administering CPR to at least one of them. Residents with scrapes and lacerations were  turned away for those in need of more urgent care. Fast Facts on earthquakes. The U.S. Geological Survey had at first measured the strength at magnitude 7.5 but later upgraded it. A strong aftershock of magnitude 6.6 was recorded a little more than a half-hour afterward, along with nearly three dozen other aftershocks, the USGS reported. The force of the quake was said by people who contacted the USGS to be from \"severe\" to \"violent,\" nearly the highest rating on the intensity scale. Tremors were felt as far as New Delhi, more than 200 miles away in neighboring India. An official said they were felt there at magnitude 5.0. The shaking was rated as \"strong\" to \"severe\" on the USGS ShakeMap. CNN sister network CNN-IBN reported that roads in the area were out. IBN reporter K. Dhiksit looked out his window in Kathmandu and saw the collapsed walls of many buildings. As he watched, an aftershock rattled the street. He heard \"big booming sounds,\" he said, and saw people fleeing into the streets. How are earthquakes measured? Photos of caved-in and toppled buildings appeared on social media.

Rescue crews and residents searched for survivors amidst the rubble, while the injured were treated outside overflowing hospitals. Dozens of bodies were pulled from the historic Dharahara tower, which collapsed during the quake. At least 17 people were reported killed on Mount Everest due to multiple avalanches. Aftershocks continued to traumatize survivors, who huddled in the cold rain for safety. The death toll is expected to rise as the full extent of the damage is assessed. The quake was the strongest in the region in over 80 years and was felt as far as New Delhi, India. Weak building codes in Nepal contributed to the structural damage. Aid agencies expressed concern for the welfare of survivors in the coming days, as overnight temperatures were expected to drop and people were forced to make do without electricity, running water, and shelter. The international community has pledged assistance to Nepal in its time of need.",

What was supposed to be an overnight pit stop in the southwestern city of Chongqing has now stretched into a two-and-a-half week stay. It's an unexpected layover that is testing the patience of the pilots and more than 60 team members, just a quarter of the way along a journey that will cover some 35,000 kilometers (21,748 miles) over five months. \"You can believe that your will can influence the weather,\" says pilot Bertrand Piccard, who comes from a long family line of explorers.  But \"then you'll be really disappointed because it doesn't work. \"Or you just know that it's an adventure you do with the forces of nature.\" Piccard, along with Andre Borschberg, a Swiss engineer, are taking turns flying the single-seater aircraft, which took off from Abu Dhabi on March 9 and has successfully flown through Oman, India, and Myanmar. There is much at stake. Their mission, which the pilots say is aimed at proving the power of renewable energy, and inspiring innovation, has been 12 years in the making. In many ways, it has become Piccard and Borschberg's raison d'etre. But so far, the Solar Impulse 2 has been spending a lot of time on the ground. The latest setback came when a Thursday takeoff was canceled, because the cross winds in Nanjing, the plane's destination, were forecast to be too strong around its expected landing time. Because of its weight, at just 2,300 kilograms -- about the same as a large SUV -- the aircraft needs near perfect weather conditions, including cross winds of less than 4 knots, or about 7 kilometers an hour, in order to fly. While the team is used to waiting, they are clearly eager to move on. \"Our boss is the sun,\" says Solar Impulse spokeswoman Claudia Durgnat. Durgnat says there may be a tiny window ahead, with the next possible departure from Chongqing on Tuesday. \"It's not good before, and the days after don't look very clear.\" Even with the delay, Durgnat says, the plane technically isn't behind schedule. That's because the team needs to wait until the end of the month for the northern hemisphere days to get longer, before the plane can venture across the Pacific Ocean to Hawaii. With more than 17,000 solar cells along the tops of its wings and fuselage, the Solar Impulse 2 stores up energy during the day, in order to power the motors that carry it through the night, typically at speeds no faster than a car on a highway. Inside a specially constructed tent at the end of the runway at Chongqing International Airport, a skeleton team of less than a dozen people works to complete the day's tasks. The rest of the crew has been waiting for weeks in Nanjing. Even with the extended stay, no time is wasted. Piccard spends a few hours of the afternoon in the cockpit, training to prepare for the Solar Impulse's crossings over the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, what the team calls \"the moment of truth.\" The plane will then return to Abu Dhabi, where it had taken off. Nearby, two technicians repair a couple of the flight computers, which display critical information in the cockpit, punching extra holes in their casings so they don't overheat. Meanwhile, Borschberg has returned to Switzerland to rest and get medical treatment for a migraine and a skin condition. The team expects him back in China early next week. Borschberg is still scheduled to fly first leg of the Pacific crossing, which could last up to five days and nights. \"The airplane is ready. The mission control center is ready. We've been waiting for that moment since so long,\" says Piccard. Borschberg and Piccard, who piloted an earlier version of the plane across the U.S. in 2013, are no strangers to adventure. Borschberg is a former fighter pilot, and Piccard was part of the first team to circumnavigate the earth nonstop in a balloon in 1999.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nMore than 22 months ago, the body of Odin Lloyd was found in an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Lloyd had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste. The semipro football player for the Boston Bandits was 27. Days after he was found dead, then-NFL star Aaron Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder. Testimony in the case against Hernandez began in January. On Wednesday, a Fall River, Massachusetts, jury -- after deliberating 35 hours over the course of seven days -- found the former New England patriots tight end guilty of first-degree murder, which carries a penalty of life without parole,  as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition. Hernandez also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide. He has pleaded not guilty. Just two years ago, he was one of the NFL's most promising tight ends, inking a $40-million contract extension with the New England Patriots. Friends and fans alike wondered: How could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be on trial for murder? Long before Hernandez made national headlines, he was a standout athlete in Bristol, Connecticut, who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty. \"I don't think there was another family that was more familiar in Bristol,\" Bob Montgomery, who covers high school sports for the Bristol Press, told CNN. The young Hernandez was the \"golden boy,\" playing football, basketball and running track, following in the footsteps of his uncle, older brother and father -- all well-known athletes in the community. Hernandez's father constantly pushed his son, requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends. \"I saw a closeness with them that I'd never seen before,\" Montgomery said of the relationship between Hernandez and his father. But his father, the man who kept the 16-year-old anchored, died from complications after a routine surgery. Hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in January 2007 to join the University of Florida Gators, and trouble seemed to follow. In just his first semester, a police report says, Hernandez got into a fight at an off-campus restaurant, sucker-punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum. The following fall, there was a shooting near a local club. Police reports linked Hernandez and several other University of Florida football players to an argument in the parking lot. Hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police, and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel. At the time, Hernandez's mother told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, \"I know he was at the club, but he never saw any shooting.\" The case remains open, and no one has been charged. Hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana, an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year. Trying to put the alleged drug use behind him, Hernandez wrote a letter to the Patriots director of personnel. \"If you draft me as a member of the New England Patriots, I will willfully submit to a biweekly drug test throughout my rookie season. ... In addition, I will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test,\" he wrote, according to the Boston Globe. Before the draft, Hernandez was expected to be a first- or second-round pick. He was passed over until the fourth round, when the Patriots selected him. By the end of his second season, he was a bona fide star, landing the $40 million contract extension. Less than a year after signing the deal, however, the Patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with Lloyd's murder. When Odin Lloyd pulled up in a black Chevrolet suburban, Boston Bandits coach Mike Branch thought something was out of place. Lloyd didn't own a car. Aaron Hernandez case: Who's who? Branch had his suspicions, but he couldn't get answers. Lloyd was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the previous night. \"He said he was at the club with Mr. Hernandez, and that they were partying and he had a good time, and that Mr. Hernandez spent a good amount of money,\" Branch recalled. Lloyd said Hernandez spent about $10,000 that night. Lloyd's friends say he wasn't a big partier. He was more passionate about football and family. Remembering Odin Lloyd. Lloyd was dating Shaneah Jenkins, the link between the young man who dreamed of the NFL and the all-American who made it. Jenkins is the younger sister of Shayanna, who's engaged to Hernandez and is the mother of his little girl. On June 16, 2013, Lloyd was riding with friends in the black Suburban, which police later learned was rented by Hernandez. Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night. As they parted ways, Lloyd told Hodge he'd see him later. The next day, Lloyd's body was found. Prosecutors say Lloyd was last seen with Hernandez and Hernandez's two associates, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver Nissan Altima. Surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an Altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m. At the same time, chilling text messages from Lloyd's phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with \"Nfl,\" adding, \"just so u know.\" Between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m., workers nearby reported hearing gunshots. At 3:29, a camera showed an Altima pulling into Hernandez's driveway, about a half a mile from the death scene. Three people got out of the car, and Lloyd was not one of them. Nine days later, Hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapons-related charges. He pleaded not guilty. In April 2014, Ortiz and Wallace were also charged in Lloyd's slaying. They, too, pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say the three men were to be tried in a joint venture, a legal term that means it's not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger as long as there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in Lloyd's murder. As the trial for the death of Lloyd neared, lawyers began arguing about evidence, including cell phones and text messages. Some rulings were victories for the defense. The jury wouldn't see the text Lloyd sent to his sister, telling her he was with \"Nfl.\" The judge ruled it hearsay and said the state hadn't proven Lloyd believed his life was in danger. Jurors also didn't hear anything about what happened in Boston on July 16, 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where Hernandez had been. The judge agreed with defense lawyers that it's far too prejudicial and irrelevant to Lloyd's murder. Investigators allege Hernandez shot and killed Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado because one of the men bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink. District Attorney Patrick Haggan described the scene in a Massachusetts courtroom in May, saying Hernandez became \"angered and increasingly agitated, particularly after Mr. Abreu smiled and did not apologize.\" Prosecutors: Bump, spilled drink led to double homicide. Hernandez's friend tried to calm him down, and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street, the prosecutor said. Court documents identify that friend as Alexander Bradley, who would go on to accuse Hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later. After leaving the second nightclub, Hernandez and the friend returned to their SUV and pulled over on a nearby street where Hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block, Haggan said. Hernandez began trailing Abreu, Furtado and three of their friends in his SUV, authorities said. He then pulled up to the victims' car at a red light and leaned out the driver's side window with a loaded revolver, Haggan told the court. Hernandez allegedly said, \"Yo, what's up now,\" followed by a racial slur, and fired at least five rounds from a .38-caliber revolver, Haggan said. Abreu, the driver, was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest. Furtado was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including one to the head, Haggan said. Hernandez was charged in the double homicide in May, and he pleaded not guilty. Investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of Lloyd.

A white banner with a blue star refers to his favorite NFL team. It says: \"Tradition, the Cowboys way.\" A few mourners trickled into the Fielding Home For Funerals in Charleston, South Carolina. Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley comes by to pay his respects and show support for the Scott family. They are not at Friday night's visitation, the mayor says.  The stress of the past week since Scott was fatally shot in the back by a North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager is too much. They went by the funeral home earlier but they are exhausted, he says. They need their privacy now and at Saturday's funeral and burial, he says. \"This is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community,\" he says, adding they share the grief of their neighbors in North Charleston and with the Scott family. \"It breaks everyone's hearts, wherever we live.\" Meanwhile, police continue to investigate the incident in which Scott ran from his car after a traffic stop then was shot while fleeing from Slager. On Friday afternoon, police met with a man who was in Scott's car when Slager pulled it over for a broken taillight. The passenger's name wasn't in a police report obtained by CNN. The passenger was detained briefly after the shooting, one officer wrote in the report. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said the man with Scott was a co-worker and friend. But he did not identify the friend by name, nor did Thom Berry, a South Carolina Law Enforcement Division spokesman, who confirmed Friday's meeting. Slager has been fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted on a murder charge. Video shot by a witness shows the officer shooting Scott in the back as he runs away. Slager had told investigators he feared for his safety after he and Scott tussled over his Taser. His lawyer, Andy Savage, said Friday he \"has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has.\" Savage's office said in a written statement that it has yet to receive \"any investigative documents, audio or video tapes, other than a copy of Mr. Slager's arrest warrant.\" The news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that Slager belongs to \"is no longer involved in the case.\" On Thursday, dash cam video and a new witness emerged from the day Scott died. The dash cam footage shows Slager talking calmly to Scott during the traffic stop. Scott apparently says he has no insurance on the vehicle, and Slager returns to his car to do paperwork. Moments later, Scott gets out of his car and bolts. A foot chase ensues. Scott never reappears on the dash cam video, but a witness later takes video of the officer shooting Scott several times in the back as he is running away. \"Nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer's life or the life of another was threatened,\" National Urban League President Marc Morial said. \"The question here is whether the use of force was excessive.\" On Thursday, a new witness emerged in the case. Gwen Nichols told CNN's Brian Todd that she saw a scuffle between Scott and Slager at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" Nichols said. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying: 'Stop!' \" Scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop, according to court records. That may be why he ran, an attorney for the family said. Criminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slager's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case. \"Defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- (that) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation, a physical altercation with a suspect,\" Callan said. \"And that would constitute manslaughter under law, as opposed to murder, and it makes a huge difference in sentencing.\" In South Carolina, a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation. What we know about Officer Slager. The investigation has been turned over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, or SLED. In a statement released Thursday, SLED said its investigators found troubling inconsistencies from the very start. \"We believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter,\" SLED Chief Mark Keel said in a statement. \"The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions.\" Feidin Santana, who took the video of the shooting, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott, who was on the ground. He said he could hear the sound of a Taser in use. Santana said he didn't see Scott go after the Taser, as Slager initially claimed. He said he believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana said. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana started recording shortly after that. His video shows Scott running away from Slager before the officer aims his gun. Slager fires eight shots toward Scott, striking him five times. A timeline of events. While the initial traffic stop may have seemed to be perfectly normal and professional, and the foot chase a reasonable choice, an analyst saw little justification for that last act. \"I'm not familiar with South Carolina police training, but I guarantee you that they do not teach to shoot a fleeing unarmed man in the back,\" said Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit. There are several claims in the initial police reports that are not supported in Santana's video. And there may be more to the investigation than just whether Scott's killing was justified, CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos said. \"If it's determined that multiple officers attempted to cover for the shooting officer, and it's shown that those reports were false, this will be a devastating blow for law enforcement everywhere,\" he said. Who was Walter Scott? CNN's Polo Sandoval reported from Charleston and Steve Almasy reported and wrote in Atlanta.

John Delaney, D-Maryland, told CNN on Friday. \"...I do think there's a larger narrative about Christian persecution (by) militant groups around the world.\" This attack wasn't carried out, but many others have been. Some acts are not centrally organized but are no less horrific, such as reports that Muslim migrants threw 12 Christians off a boat in the Mediterranean Sea. Other deadly acts and alleged plots have been blamed on established terror groups, including these recent examples:. Sid Ahmed Ghlam asked for an ambulance to come to his Paris home on Sunday after (he claimed) he accidentally shot himself in the thigh. Besides getting medical help, Ghlam was arrested after authorities found four Kalashnikov guns, a revolver, ammunition, police armbands and more in his car and residence, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said on Wednesday. They also turned up \"documents in Arabic mentioning al Qaeda and ISIS\" and correspondence with someone in Syria \"asking him to target a church.\" Prime Minister Manuel Valls later went to a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif, one of the at least two such Christian places of worship that Ghlam allegedly targeted. While he didn't elaborate, Molins said that the satellite navigation system in Ghlam's car -- which included a loaded Kalashnikov and more -- had one church's location plugged in. It's not clear what group, if any, Ghlam was working with or possibly getting orders from. Still, authorities flatly characterized him as a terrorist -- linking him to the death of 32-year-old Aurelie Chatelain, whom Molins called the region's first victim of terrorism since the Charlie Hebdo massacre and kosher market siege in January. Regardless of whether Ghlam is ever convicted in Chatelain's killing, it appears unlikely that he'll be able to commit more violence anytime soon. \"A terrorist attack has been foiled,\" French President Francois Hollande said. ISIS has turned its beheadings of hostages into horror shows, producing propaganda videos seemingly aimed at producing the maximum amount of terror. What set the one from April apart were the number of people killed and that they were Christians from Ethiopia. Ethiopia's government said Monday that 30 of its citizens were among two groups of prisoners shown being beheaded in Libya in a video released a day earlier, according to the Ethiopian News Agency. That 39-minute video shows one set of captives killed on a beach along the Mediterranean Sea, while the other group is taken hundreds of miles away, to southern Libya. \"All praise be to Allah, the Lord and cherisher of the world and may peace and blessings be upon the Prophet Mohammed,\" the video's narrator says in Arabic. \"To the nation of the cross, we are back again on the sands, where the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, have stepped on before, telling you: Muslim blood that was shed under the hands of your religion is not cheap.\" The same video brazenly claims that ISIS has been merciful to Christians in Iraq -- by giving them the choice of paying a fine if they refuse to convert to Islam. But not all have taken this offer, according to a different speaker. \"The Islamic State has offered the Christian community this many times and set a deadline for this,\" this speaker says, using the name ISIS calls itself. \"But the Christians never cooperated.\" Everyone at Kenya's Garissa University College suffered in some way when a handful of Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed the campus early this month. But death was reserved for Christians. According to AFP, the terrorists separated students by religion -- allowing Muslims to leave and killing Christians. Nightmare accounts soon emerged, like that of Cynthia Cherotich, who told CNN that she he hid in her closet when gunmen burst in and called out two of her roommates. \"(The attackers) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, ... then you lie down,\" recalled Cherotich, who refused to come out for two days. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" This tactic of separating non-Muslims from Muslims mirrors what Al-Shabaab attackers did in December at a quarry in the Kenyan village of Kormey, where at least 36 were killed, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. One of Al-Shabaab's explicit aims is to turn Somalia, its home base, into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council of Foreign Relations. But that's not its only apparent goal, as the group has increasingly branched out -- including into neighboring Kenya, which is 80% Christian -- to inflict pain and terror. After the the Kenya university attack, which left nearly 150 people dead, Nadif Jama, Garissa's regional governor, dismissed Al-Shabaab's claims that it only kills non-Muslims as \"a tricky way of doing business.\" \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that, in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Jama said, claiming the group's militants are \"bent on nothing but destruction. ... That is something we need to fight.\" Two suicide blasts rocked a Christian community in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, killing at least 14 people and wounding scores more, according to officials. And that's just the beginning, pledged the Pakistani Taliban. One of the blasts left behind panicked residents, twisted metal and shattered glass outside a church compound in the Nishtar Colony of Lahore, according to video aired by CNN affiliate GEO News. Afterward, Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan claimed responsibility for the carnage and promised more such attacks until Sharia law is implemented in Pakistan. These blasts recalled one from September 2013, when 81 people died in a suicide bombing at the All Saints of Church of Pakistan in Peshawar. Two attackers burst into the church filled with about 500 people right as services concluded, blowing themselves up, according to the Protestant diocese. Choir members and children attending Sunday school were among the dead. In a subsequent statement, the Rev. Humphrey S. Peter, the bishop of Peshawar, called the attack a \"total failure\" of official efforts to protect minorities such as Christians, who make up less than 3% of Pakistan's population. Sadly, the shock of the mass killings of the Ethiopian Christians in April may have been dulled simply because of a nearly identical atrocity a few weeks before. ISIS released a five-minute video in February showing the mass murder of Coptic Christians from Egypt. Produced by the Islamic State's propaganda wing al-Hayat Media, the video shows black-clad jihadists standing behind their victims on a Libyan beach. Some of the hostages cry out \"Oh God\" and \"Oh Jesus\" as they are pushed to the ground, just before they take their final breaths. \"The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah, we will mix it with your blood,\" a masked man says in English before the beheadings. News of this mass beheading emerged weeks after 21 Egyptian Christians were kidnapped in two incidents in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte. The ISIS video shows the beheading of around a dozen men, though Egyptian officials say all 21 kidnapped Christians were killed. Egypt's government responded with airstrikes on 10 targets used for training and storage in ISIS' Libyan stronghold of Derna, according to Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. \"Avenging Egyptian blood and punishing criminals and murderers is our right and duty,\" the Egyptian military said in a statement that was broadcast on state television. Modern-day Assyrians are a significant part of human history, tracing their roots back to one of the earliest civilizations. Their ancestors were also some of the first people to embrace Christianity in large numbers. Now the Assyrians are battling ISIS for survival in their native Syria and Iraq. This fight came into focus in February, when the militant group took over villages and took more than 260 Assyrians hostage in northeastern Syria, according to Osama Edward, the founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network. Edward expressed fears then that these Assyrians in Syria would meet the same fate as others in neighboring Iraq. Some of the Assyrian hostages taken in February have been released, but the fate of many more remains unknown. Even those not in captivity face dire threats, given ISIS's well-established reputation of offering little to no mercy to Christians. The number of Christians in Iraq has plummeted -- from 1.5 million some 20 years ago to some 300,000 today, according to estimates from CAPNI, the largest Christian relief organization in northern Iraq. ISIS isn't the only reason for this drop, but it certainly is a big one. The militant group has been brazen in its onslaught in Iraq as well as Syria, with Christians among its targets. That includes its taking over Iraq's largest Christian city, the mostly Assyrian community of Qaraqosh, in August 2014. ISIS has inflicted pain and suffering well beyond Qaraqosh, though, like its capture and control of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. The group's advance there prompted Christian families to flee rather than adhere to the ultimatum of converting to Islam, paying a fine or facing \"death by sword.\" Mark Arabo, a Chaldean-American leader and spokesman for the group Ending Genocide in Iraq, claims that Iraqi Christian children have been beheaded, mothers raped and fathers killed by ISIS militants in recent months. \"This is truly a living nightmare that's not going away,\" Arabo told CNN. \"Christianity in Mosul is dead, and a Christian holocaust is in our midst.\"\n\noutput:",
        "answer": "Several terrorist groups, including ISIS and Al-Shabaab, aim to establish societies governed by strict versions of Sharia law, targeting those who do not subscribe to their extremist views, including Christians. The latest threat against the Vatican was revealed in March 2010 by Italian prosecutors, linking it to a network of Pakistanis associated with al Qaeda. In France, a man named Sid Ahmed Ghlam was arrested in March 2015 with weapons, documents mentioning al Qaeda and ISIS, and correspondence asking him to target a church. Ghlam is currently under investigation for the murder of Aurelie Chatelain. ISIS has targeted Christians in Libya, beheading 30 Ethiopian Christians in April 2015. Al-Shabaab separated Christians from Muslims and killed them during an attack on Kenya's Garissa University College in April 2015, leaving nearly 150 people dead. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for two suicide blasts at a Christian community in Lahore, killing at least 14 people and wounding scores more.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nWould a taste of the finest Swiss chocolate make you happy? Or soaking in the warm Icelandic springs? Perhaps the great jazz and rock music scene in Denmark is for you? It's not just the fun activities that make locals and travelers to those countries happy, according to the third World Happiness Report, released by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network for the United Nations on April 23. People who live in the happiest countries have longer life expectancies and more social support, experience more generosity, have more freedom to make life choices, have lower perceptions of corruption and have a higher gross domestic product per capita, the report shows. The tiny country of Bhutan, a very happy country famous for measuring the \"Gross National Happiness\" of its people, gets the credit for focusing world attention on happiness: Its Prime Minister proposed the idea of a World Happiness Day to the United Nations in 2011. Recognizing \"happiness and well-being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world,\" the U.N. General Assembly declared March 20 as World Happiness Day in 2012. This officially designated happy date marked its fourth year last month. Through the happiness report, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network hopes to encourage governments at every level to measure and improve their people's happiness. \"There is no single key to happiness,\" said Jeffrey Sachs, the network's director and an economics professor at Columbia University. \"All of these countries do well in several ways. Being rich? That's good, but it's only a modest part of the story. Trusting society, having a government that ranks on low in corruption, a society where people are generous and volunteering -- all of these are important for happiness.\" Even if you don't live in one of the 10 happiest countries in the world, a visit to these happy places will give you a taste of what the locals enjoy every day. Here are the top 10 happiest places on Earth, according to the World Happiness Report. 1. Switzerland. Switzerland took the top spot from Denmark in 2015, rising from third to first place in this year's list of the world's happiest countries. Bern, the capital city of Switzerland, has the cobblestone streets and medieval architecture that make it apparent why the old city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since the city's founding in the 12th century, it has expanded in an often neat and orderly fashion. And the lovely River Aare offers in-town swimming and boating. Looking to get out of the capital city? Book a trip to Lucerne, where you can take a boat trip on the lake, ride the panorama gondola, take in the views on the new Dragon Ride aerial cableway and ride on the world's steepest cog railway. Book the Golden Round trip and get all four trips -- and stunning views of the Alps -- in one day. (The railway reopens in mid-May.) And no matter where you go, there will certainly be plenty of delicious chocolate to try. 2. Iceland. Nature and culture combine to make Iceland a truly happy place, so delightful that the tiny country jumped from ninth to second place this year. Explore South Iceland, where many of the ancient tales -- called sagas -- that document Iceland's 10th- and 11th-century history are remembered.  A two-hour drive from the capital city of Reykjavik, south Iceland is home to Vatnajokull Glacier, the 60-meter (197-foot) Skogafoss Waterfall and amazing fresh seafood. (Though you could probably skip the fermented shark ...) No matter where you visit, there's probably a geothermal swimming pool or hot spring spa to soak your weary bones after a long day of exploring. And when you get back to the capital, note that the renowned annual Reykjavik Art Festival will take place from May 17 through June 7. 3. Denmark. Never mind that Denmark lost the top spot this year and is now the third-happiest country in the world. Looking at all that Danes have to be happy about, you won't notice the slight dip while you're enjoying jazz at the Copenhagen Jazz Festival in July, hanging out with the hipsters at Queen Louise's Bridge, taking a canal tour or playing beach volleyball in front of the Royal Danish Playhouse. Prefer your music in the woods? Head to Smuk Fest (\"The Beautiful Festival\"), a rock/pop festival in the woods of Skanderborg held in August. Wherever you go, enjoy that Danish tradition of \"hygge,\" sometimes translated too simply as the need for \"coziness.\" It's really a complex sense of intimacy, community and contentment that generally happens with friends and family, and it makes for one happy country. Project Happy: 10 ways to get happy. 4. Norway. The sun never sets in some parts of Norway during the summer months, and the North Cape area is one of the best spots to play when the sun stays out for 24 hours. Visitors love to golf, hike and even run a marathon during the months ruled by the midnight sun. If your taste buds dictate your travels, head to the Norwegian capital city of Oslo, a gastronomic paradise where the Michelin food guide has awarded five stars among four restaurants: Ylajali, Statholdergaarden and Fauna (one star each) and Maeemo (two stars). 5. Canada. Canada combines European style, sensibility and history with the enormous natural wonder of North America. Within the French-speaking province of Quebec, a tour through the historic city of Old Quebec is a treat for any Francophile. Founded in the early 17th century, it's the only North American city north of Mexico that still has its fortifications. The historic district is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Just a few minutes from downtown Quebec City, Ile d'Orleans is a small island where farming and agriculture are still a way of life. And if nature is what you crave, in less an hour from Québec City, you could be hiking through the Parc national de la Jacques-Cartier, home to the glacial Vallée de la Jacques-Cartier. 50 states, 50 spots to get happy around the U.S. 6. Finland. What a happy event to spot the rare Saimaa ringed seal, which adapted to freshwater living after the Ice Age cut off its lake home from the sea. There are only about 300 of them in the world, and they can be found at Lake Saimaa in eastern Finland. But you might have more luck spotting the white whooper swan, Finland's national bird, whose arrival heralds the start of spring. For a more urban experience, visit Helsinki's Market Square and Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma. And you can still spot animals in the capital city: In mid-May, the cows will be herded into the fields in Viikki, a neighborhood in Helsinki, after the long winter. Locals always gather to celebrate this moo-ving event. 7. Netherlands (Holland) Though the Netherlands' tulips are without equal, and they are most stunning at Keukenhof (known as the Garden of Europe), there are so many beautiful spots across the country to walk and bike to welcome spring and its trademark flower. For a more regal celebration, note that the kingdom celebrates its 200th year this year with many festivities. 8. Sweden. In a country that's very fond of celebration, Swedes love to celebrate midsummer, the longest day of the year, most of all. It's a national holiday marked with traditional food and dances around a maypole. Can't make the midsummer parties? There's still plenty to do. Just 20 minutes from the capital city of Stockholm, the Stockholm Archipelago of about 30,000 islands offers endless opportunities for contentment. Swimming, hiking, cycling, fishing, horseback riding -- it's all within your reach by booking a boat ride. (Some boat trips include meals and tours of many of the islands.) 9. New Zealand. New to the top 10 list of happiest countries, New Zealand has plenty of reasons to celebrate. Though it's always been an attractive spot to explore, Peter Jackson choosing the country to host the filming of the \"Lord of the Rings\" movie trilogy has given New Zealand more attention than money could buy. The capital city of Wellington has benefited from the growth of the movie industry, developing a happening restaurant and design scene. And many of the country's natural wonders have gained international attention, including the 2,291-meter (7,516-foot)-high Mount Ngauruhoe, which played the fictional Mount Doom. It's part of Tongariro National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 10. Australia. The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest collection of coral reefs, is a natural phenomenon not to be missed. Australians are arguing fiercely over manmade threats to its existence  (and no one is happy about that). Once you've had a chance to explore that magical underwater realm, head to the Australian state of Tasmania, an island 240 kilometers (149 miles) off the mainland coast. The Tasmanian Wilderness, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, includes one of the last surviving temperate rainforests in the world. To see the wilderness up close, try hiking the stunning 65-kilometer (40-mile) Overland Track. It takes about six days for hikers (who must book the trip in advance), but day-trippers can take short hikes starting at Cradle Mountain Visitor Centre and Dove Lake.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 180 words:\nTikrit, Iraq (CNN)ISIS is gone, but the fear remains. As Iraqi forces, aided by Shiite militiamen, took control Wednesday of the northern city of Tikrit, they found vehicles laden with explosives and buildings that might be booby-trapped. CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon, who was in Tikrit on Tuesday, saw a large mechanical digger packed with explosives that Iraqi forces had to disarm. The troops, she said, were cautious when they entered buildings in case they were wired to explode. Plumes of smoke rose from burning buildings in the background. Near former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces compound -- Tikrit is Hussein's birthplace -- the CNN team also saw a destroyed truck with a large machine gun mounted on the back. Iraqi forces said they had fired an RPG at the truck, killing three ISIS fighters. ISIS was ejected from the palaces compound in fierce fighting, they said, adding that there may still be booby traps. Federal police said they dismantled hundreds of IEDs (improvised explosive devices) Wednesday. CNN heard at least 16 explosions, some very loud, which police said were controlled. The potential booby traps were political as well as physical. Officials are concerned about the behavior of the conquerors, particularly the Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen who helped Iraqi troops. Officials fear the militiamen might take \"scorched earth\" reprisals for the reported massacre of Shiite air force cadets by ISIS fighters in Tikrit last year. Much of the population of Tikrit is, like ISIS, Sunni Muslim. And officials fear that reprisals by Shiite militias against the Sunni population could stoke local anger, jeopardizing the government's ability to hold onto Tikrit and pull the country together. Sectarian resentment helped fuel the rise of ISIS in the first place. 'Where are our sons?' demand families of soldiers captured by ISIS. Still, the liberation of Tikrit from the terrorist group, which is also known as ISIL and calls itself the Islamic State, represented a significant victory for the Iraqi government, which had tried -- and failed -- to retake the city many times before. Iraqi  Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi arrived Wednesday to claim the victory, which took place a year after the city was first attacked by ISIS. Al-Abadi, who is also Iraq's top military commander, had announced the previous evening on Iraqiya TV that the city was under the control of Iraqi forces. Iraqi forces continued to clean out pockets of resistance Wednesday, said Interior Minister Mohammed al-Ghabban, who was also in the city. But he said the Iraqi government would be in full control shortly. \"The enemy has been defeated, and it has lost all its capabilities,\" al-Ghabban said. \"In the coming hours, the battle will end.\" Iraqi security said that the few ISIS militants left in the city are hiding inside houses hoping to escape in the dark. ISIS' nine-month dominion over Tikrit was marked by brutality. In addition to the reported massacre of the 1,500-plus air force cadets at Camp Speicher in June, ISIS is believed to have buried victims in mass graves and to have destroyed an Assyrian church that had graced Tikrit since the eighth century. The push into Tikrit came days after U.S.-led airstrikes targeted ISIS bases around the city. Al-Abadi said those tactics would now be replicated in other areas. Brett McGurk, the U.S. deputy special presidential envoy to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, tweeted that the coalition's airstrikes had destroyed numerous ISIS shelters. \"We will continue to support courageous Iraqi forces operating under Iraqi command as they work to reclaim their territory from #ISIL,\" McGurk tweeted. The key to victory in Tikrit this time, the Prime Minister said, was surprise. But help from the coalition of Shiite militiamen and volunteers also played a part. The militia members, estimated to number around 20,000, are backed by Iran. The offensive marked the first open participation of Iranian advisers on the front lines in Iraq. The victory in Tikrit sets the stage for Iraqi forces to take back an even bigger prize -- Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. A U.S. official said in February that up to 25,000 Iraqi troops plan to return to Mosul in April or May in an effort to retake the city. Don Melvin wrote this report in London. Arwa Damon and Hamdi Alkhshali reported from Tikrit and Jomana Karadsheh from Baghdad.\n\noutput:",

Slager, 33, was charged Tuesday with first-degree murder after firing eight shots at Scott, killing him. Slager is also now \"terminated\" from the force, North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey said Wednesday. Added police Chief Eddie Driggers on Wednesday: \"I watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw and I have not watched it since.\" Both Scott and Slager had once served in the U.S. Coast Guard, with Scott's service occurring 1984-86 and Slager's 2003-09. Scott was a father of four. Slager is a father to two stepchildren, and his wife is eight months' pregnant. Here's what we know of the fatal shooting:. Slager pulled Scott over at 9:33 a.m. Saturday for a broken taillight, according to authorities. Chief Driggers described the incident as \"traffic stop of an individual who had a minor infraction on his vehicle, a brake light being out.\" A foot chase then occurred, a police report said. The video, taken by a passer-by, doesn't show any vehicle. Rather, Slager and Scott are on a path or roadway in a parklike setting bordered partly by a chain-link fence. The video was shot over and through the fence. \"The officer said that Walter ran from the vehicle during the traffic stop,\" Scott family attorney L. Chris Stewart said. According to the police report, Scott did not comply with the officer's demands. Scott's brother, Anthony Scott, said his brother had trouble with child support and had an outstanding warrant against him, but that his sibling wasn't prone to violence. \"That very well could have been the reason (for running from police), not to be arrested for the warrant that was on him for child support,\" Anthony Scott said. The video begins by showing a second or two of an apparent struggle between the officer and suspect. The officer contended he used a Taser stun gun on Scott and that Scott tried to take that weapon, authorities said. But when Anthony Scott saw the video, he was convinced the officer lied, he told CNN. \"There was not a struggle for the Taser,\" Anthony Scott said. \"I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway.\" The video shows Walter Scott running away, with his back to the officer. As he does so, two objects fall. One falls behind the officer. And the other falls between the two men. To Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was \"running for his life\" away from the officer to escape more of the Taser. \"I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot. No one would have thought that,\" Scott said. As Walter Scott runs away, the officer pulls his service pistol and fires eight times, the video shows. As the shots are being fired, Scott keeps running away from the officer, the video shows. Scott then falls. Later in the video, when the officer approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. It's not clear whether it is the Taser. It's also unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser, or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. Immediately after Scott was shot, according to the video, someone yells, \"Put your hands behind your back!\" Scott, motionless and face-down on the ground, is handcuffed. It was Slager who apparently called police dispatch. \"226 to dispatch, shots fired, subject is down. He grabbed my Taser,\" Slager told the dispatcher, according to a transcript provide by Broadcastify.com. The dispatcher notes that the subject is down at 9:38 a.m., according to the transcript. About 90 seconds after saying that Scott \"grabbed\" his Taser, the officer describes Scott as unresponsive and having wounds to the chest, right thigh and buttocks, according to the transcript. The location of the shooting is behind a pawn shop, the officer tells the dispatcher. A police report identified that shop as Mega Pawn. According to CNN affiliate WCIV-TV in Charleston, Slager initially said through his attorney, David Aylor, that he followed the appropriate policies and procedures. However, Aylor later told CNN that he was no longer representing the officer. \"Today, I withdrew my representation of Michael Slager. This is a terrible tragedy that has impacted our community,\" Aylor said in a statement. Later, Anthony Scott's mother calls him and says his brother was Tasered at a traffic stop. Anthony Scott goes to the scene and finds it curious to see police tape around his brother's vehicle and the officer's vehicle. He asks officers what happened. No one replies. Then Anthony Scott's nephew tells him that \"my brother is gone,\" Anthony Scott said. \"And at that, I lost it,\" Anthony Scott said. An officer also apprises him later of what happened. Anthony Scott is shown the video for the first time on Sunday. \"My reaction to it was that we have to get ahold of the video and that this was key evidence, key evidence in the case,\" Anthony Scott said. \"We had to get it. The country had to see this.\" He felt \"a little bit of anger and happy at the same time,\" the brother said. \"Based on what the video was showing, it was discrediting what the officer had initially stated,\" Anthony Scott said. The nation did indeed see the video -- and was stunned by its revelations. Authorities saw it, too. Slager was denied bail at a bond hearing Tuesday night, WCIV reported. \"I have two stepchildren and one on the way,\" Slager told a magistrate through video conferencing. If found guilty of murder, Slager could face up to life in prison or death. The city of North Charleston will continue to cover the insurance for the pregnancy of Slager's wife, the mayor said. An autopsy on Scott, performed Sunday, \"revealed that Mr. Scott sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body and the manner of death was ruled 'Homicide,' \" Charleston County Coroner Rae H. Wooten said Wednesday. Anthony Scott said Wednesday that his brother was \"shot in the back four times.\" The autopsy findings support family's claims that the police used excessive use -- even if the video never existed, Anthony Scott said. \"Eventually we would have gotten to this point, but not this fast,\" Anthony Scott said. \"There is absolutely no way to cover that up,\" he added about the gunshot wounds to the back. North Charleston police aren't involved in the investigation into the shooting and have turned the matter over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. The FBI is also investigating. Anthony Scott and family attorney Stewart believe the object that Officer Slager relocated at the crime scene is the Taser, they said. Stewart also accused the officer of trying to plant evidence by moving the Taser and placing it close to Walter Scott's body. A slow-motion analysis of the tape, along with highlights of key moments, supports the family's step-by-step interpretation of the officer's actions, including the handling of the Taser, the attorney alleged. \"He drops the Taser, kills Mr. Scott, walks all the way back, picks something up off the ground from where he was taking the shots, comes back to the body, waits a second, drops it on the ground, and then pretends to be recovering it and putting it back on his holster,\" Stewart said, referring to the Taser. \"Why we believe that is because it fits in line with his initial report of what happened out there. I mean he just committed a murder. He needed something, a justifiable reason to use lethal force, and that's the only thing he could think of,\" Stewart said. Neither Officer Slager or his attorney could be reached for comment Wednesday. Authorities aren't commenting on the details of the case while it's under investigation. CNN's Ashley Fantz, Holly Yan, Ryan Scallan, Tristan Smith, Martin Savidge, Dana Ford, Sam Stringer, Randi Kaye, Chandler Friedman, Evan Perez, Don Lemon, Steve Brusk, John Newsome, Tony Marco and Christie Bear contributed to this report.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nDongguan, China (CNN)For a decade, the New South China Mall -- the biggest shopping mall in the world -- has been an embarrassment for its owners and China. Opened to the public in 2005 in Dongguan in the south of the country, the goal was to attract 100,000 visitors a day with an array of entertainment, shops and eateries. Outside the mall, a giant Egyptian sphinx and a replica of the Arc de Triomphe were erected alongside fountains and canals complete with Venetian gondolas. It even boasted an indoor roller coaster. But despite the grand plans neither stores nor shoppers came. Soon, it was classified by industry analysts as a \"dead mall\" and it became an unflattering symbol of China's runaway speculation on real estate projects. The mall spans five million square feet of shopping area, making it the largest in the world in terms of leasable space -- more than twice the size of Mall of America, the biggest shopping center in the United States. When I visited two years ago, the mall was deserted. Most units were empty. Paint was coming off the walls and store signs and advertisements had faded. The air had a dry smell of dust and garbage was piled everywhere. The occupancy rate was less than 10%. It was a walk through a ghost mall. However, a visit in late March revealed a different picture. The mall was buzzing with activity. Large parts of the previously abandoned buildings are now full of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues. Visitors could be seen browsing for luxury sunglasses and designer jeans, dining at the Korean, Italian or Chinese restaurants or enjoying the new entertainment facilities. Screams and laughter can be heard from merry-go-rounds. \"It's been a big change. It's a clear modernization,\" said David Carr, an English teacher from the United States who is living in Dongguan with his wife Danae, also a teacher. \"We come here at least once a month now.\" Despite the signs of life, much of the mall is still vacant. But most of the unoccupied units, along with halls and walkways are under renovation. Even on a Saturday, it's full of construction workers and the constant sound of jack-hammering and sawing. Ms Shu, head of New South China Mall's marketing unit, told CNN that there are plans for a re-launch ceremony this spring, when all construction work will be completed and most shop and restaurant areas are leased to tenants. \"All construction that is currently going on at the mall is preparation for the opening in May,\" she said, declining to give her full name. \"We expect that from May, we will have almost full occupancy rate and no empty shops.\" She said she couldn't offer any more details as she was not authorized to speak with media. Ms Ye, head of investments, confirmed that \"business is really great,\" but would not comment further. Dutch retail chain Spar, which has expanded its supermarket to two floors, explained on its website that it had re-launched last year during the mall's \"upgrading and retrofitting program.\" There are also plenty of recruitment ads posted at the entrance of the mall. When I spoke to her, Huang Haiyan, a young Chinese woman, was just two days away from opening a little café called \"Miss & H\" in one of the passage ways being renovated. Sitting on the sidewalk outside the café, she and her partners were busy washing up cups, classes and plates ahead of the big day. \"I'm so excited!\" she said, showing the kind of enthusiasm that had been non-existent when I last visited the mall two years ago. \"You must come, my coffee is the best in China!\" The area around the previously run-down Arc de Triomphe is now a tranquil roofed boulevard with small coffee shops where youngsters play cards and mothers sip lattes. In January, a globe shaped IMAX-style cinema was launched at the outdoor square. One of the more eye-catching new sources of entertainment is a role-playing amusement center for children called Myrules World. Today, it no longer feels like a walk through a ghost mall. It's hard to believe how rapid the change has been. Economist Brian Jackson says the shift in focus towards restaurants and businesses that target China's middle, rather than, upper class, is a smart move on behalf of the developers. \"Many large malls (and residential construction) in China.... are all hoping to target one demographic -- the upper class,\" he said. \"What is needed to succeed is retail space that caters to (the much larger) bulk of middle-class Chinese.\" And, he says, other developments that were once labeled \"ghost cities\" have gone on to thrive. \"One to three years is a blink of an eye in terms of city developments, so many of these cities still have time to fill and become functional,\"Jackson said. Despite its retrofitting program, the problems that have dogged the mall since its start will not disappear instantly. Most of Dongguan's almost 10 million inhabitants are migrant workers struggling to make ends meet. The town is also facing difficulties as manufacturing moves elsewhere in China or to Southeast Asia where wages are lower. China is also haunted by serious problems in its real-estate market, with over investment and large vacancy rates. In March, prices of new homes fell for the twelfth consecutive month. What's more, the mall's latest re-launch is not its first. In 2007, the mall changed name from \"South China Mall\" to \"New South China Mall, Living City\" and a revitalization plan was drawn up by current owners the Founders Group, a conglomerate set up by Peking University, and its subsidiary PKU Founder. But the revamp failed and the mall remained empty. Now, the owners are hoping for third time lucky. PICTURES: Inside a Chinese ghost city.\n\noutput:",

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nAt first blush, Brian Rogers and Caitlin McGuire seem like any other small business owners -- polite, hardworking and passionate about what they do. But there's the potential for things to get a little awkward when the conversation turns from \"hi\"s to highs. \"There's always a moment of hesitation of 'when are they going to ask us what we do?' and 'how are they going to receive that when we tell them?'\" McGuire, 25, said. She and Rogers, 34, own the Breckenridge Cannabis Club, a recreational marijuana dispensary in the historic and scenic ski town of Breckenridge, Colorado. The couple started their business as a medical cannabis dispensary in 2010, but when Colorado became the first state in the nation to allow the sale of recreational marijuana, they saw a once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity. Previously, they were only permitted to sell medical marijuana to the approximate 4,500 permanent residents of Breckenridge; when the new legislation took effect on January 1, 2014, they could then sell to any of the 30,000-plus tourists (21 years or older) who visited the town during peak season. By the end of the first day of \"recreational\" sales, they knew their lives had changed forever. The two said they brought in more than $47,000 in sales, roughly 30 times their normal daily sales of medical marijuana. The long lines and enthusiastic patrons also raised the ire of some of the residents who felt the shop detracted from the town's \"family-friendly\" atmosphere. Now, the pair's journey to build a legal marijuana empire is documented in the new CNN Original Series \"High Profits,\" which premieres Sunday, April 19, at 10 p.m. ET/PT. \"Somebody is going to become a mogul,\" Rogers said. In 2014, legal marijuana was a $700 million industry in Colorado and was billed as the fastest growing industry in the United States.  And, according to a a 2014 Gallup Poll, 51% of Americans favored legalizing marijuana, though that was down from the previous year's approval of 58%. It's a majority, but a slim majority -- and 23 states still prohibit marijuana outright. Here are the next states to legalize pot. \"We want to show people that it's not just a bunch of stoners selling pot over the counter,\" McGuire said. \"It's business-minded people -- hardworking Americans -- who are just like any other business and trying to make their dream work.\" She and Rogers are simultaneously pragmatic and optimistic about the public's opinion. It's 2015: Is weed legal in your state? \"I think they often think we woke up and it was handed to us. Our job was created; we created our jobs through hard work and investment and risk,\" Rogers said. As pioneers in a newly legalized business, the risks Rogers and McGuire face go above and beyond those of your average small business. While the sale and private consumption of cannabis is legal in Colorado, the federal government still considers it a Schedule I controlled substance like heroin or LSD, a dangerous drug with \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\" That classification makes it difficult for banks -- which are federally regulated -- to do business with marijuana retailers, even legal ones. Few even try. This is pot's $3 billion banking problem. And forget about paying for your pot with plastic. Like most Colorado cannabis stores, the Breckenridge Cannabis Club is a cash only business. Without access to banking, McGuire and Rogers are forced to pay their staff, their suppliers and even their taxes in cash. The two recognize that \"budtender\" might not be a career path any family expects their child to embark on, but for the most part, there has been surprising support: McGuire even got permission to use the remainder of her college fund to start Breckenridge Cannabis Club more than five years ago. \"For both of us, it was pretty easy to see this as a great opportunity to do something different,\" McGuire said. \"We were just working in the service industry so it's not like either of us had any full-fledged careers that we were afraid to leave behind or families that we were worried about risking or providing for.\" What's worse -- pot or booze? Rogers' family used to tell his grandmother that he and McGuire ran a ski rental business. \"Then one day she was like, 'You don't rent skis, do you?'\" he laughs. McGuire had a similar experience with her grandma, until she came to the store for the first time and saw its legitimacy. \"She thought we were just your stereotypical drug dealers,\" she said. The couple says their grandmothers' attitude shift is what they're hoping for on a larger scale: While you may not agree with them, entrepreneurs in four states and the District of Columbia are out to prove that recreational cannabis and capitalism can coexist. \"We're cannabis consumers and we support that part of it, too. But that's not what this business is about,\" McGuire said. \"It's about having the opportunity to create a life for us and have a professional career that sustains us.\" Will they succeed?

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nIndonesia has a tough stance on drug smugglers, and since assuming office in October, President Joko Widodo has made it clear he intends to show no mercy toward those found guilty of such crimes. That tough stance casts a further pall on two Australian drug smugglers, part of the so-called \"Bali Nine.\" They are waiting to learn whether they will be put to death by firing squad after an Indonesian court rejected a last ditch effort to gain clemency from Widodo on Monday. April marks a decade on death row for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for their part in a failed heroin smuggling plot. The 31-year-old Chan has been called the ringleader and 33-year-old Sukumaran has been described as his collaborator.  The seven others who took part in the operation are serving lengthy prison sentences for trafficking the drugs. The members of the Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Four members of the group were caught at Denpasar International Airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies.  Four others, including Sukumaran, were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta.  Although he wasn't carrying any drugs, Chan was detained after boarding a plane to Sydney.  He was named by others as the mastermind of the smuggling plot. While the purported ringleaders have received media attention for years, the other seven members of the Bali Nine have rarely been in the spotlight. Here's a quick look at the other members of the group:. Scott Rush. Indonesian prosecutors asked for and received a sentence of life in prison for several of the Bali Nine, who were identified as drug couriers in the operation. That includes Scott Rush of Brisbane, Australia. Rush was 19 when he was captured in Indonesia. He was arrested at Denpasar Airport with more than 1 kilogram of heroin strapped to his body. Michael Czugaj. Life in prison was the original sentence for 29-year-old Michael Czugaj, also of Brisbane. Nineteen at the time of his arrest, Czugaj is one of five of the Bali Nine whose sentence was reduced to 20 years in prison, then reinstated at life again.  During his trial, Czugaj testified he was lured into the drug scheme with the promise of a free holiday to Bali. He was quoted in news reports as saying his life was threatened, as well as his family's, if he refused to cooperate with the heroin smuggling operation. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen from Brisbane, who is now 31, was one of four drug couriers in the case. He was found in a hotel room on Bali's Kuta Beach with a small amount of heroin and drug paraphernalia. Si Yi Chen and Matthew Norman. The others are Si Yi Chen, 30 and Matthew Norman, 28, both from Sydney.  Foreignprisoners.com quotes Chen as saying he deeply regrets his actions and did not mean to hurt others, especially his family.   Norman is quoted on the same website expressing remorse for his actions and hopes that people back home, \"don't judge me too harshly.\"  He says he has two sisters including a twin. Foreignprisoners.com is run by Foreign Prisoner Support Service, a nonprofit organization based in South Africa. Martin Stephen and Rena Lawrence. The same website details information about Martin Stephens, now 39, and the only woman in the Bali Nine, 37-year-old Renae Lawrence. Stephens was a former bartender from Towradgi, a suburb of Wollongong in New South Wales. He claims he was forced to travel to Bali and take part in the drug smuggling operation after death threats against his family. Lawrence, from Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, was arrested with heroin strapped to her body.  She claims Chan threatened her life if she did not take part in the scheme.  During her court appeal, Lawrence apologized to Indonesia for her actions.  Her original life sentence was also reduced to 20 years. During a court appearance in 2006, Chan denied threatening anyone.  He told the Denpasar District Court before his sentencing in February of that year:  \"A lot of lies have been said against me, but the true reality is I'm not what people put me out to be. I've never threatened anybody in my life.\" The Denpasar District Court also dismissed claims that Chan made threats against Lawrence and Rush when the two were sentenced in 2006. Australia has repeatedly called for clemency for Chan and Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Monday, \"The Government is disappointed at today's decision by the State Administrative Court of Jakarta to reject the appeals of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. We understand that the legal team for Mr. Chan and Mr. Sukumaran is considering other legal options.\" In a news release posted to the Australian government's website, Bishop cited the \"extensive rehabilitation\" both men have undergone and said she will continue to appeal to her counterpart while Australia continues to \"use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution.\"\n\noutput:",

Chan, described as the ringleader, and Sukumaran, his collaborator, were arrested in 2005 and sentenced to death in 2006. Seven others involved in the operation are serving lengthy prison sentences. The other members of the group include Scott Rush, Michael Czugaj, Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, Si Yi Chen, Matthew Norman, Martin Stephens, and Renae Lawrence. All have expressed remorse for their actions.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 200 words:\nNairobi, Kenya  (CNN)They were sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, friends and fellow citizens. They were students and dreamers, pursuing their ambition for a better life. And on Tuesday night, Kenyans remembered them as innocent victims of a terrorist attack that stunned a nation and left communities heartbroken. The gathering started with quiet chatter among a crowd of hundreds before mourners went silent and moved toward one end of Nairobi's Uhuru Park. Organizers unloaded 147 crosses from a truck and quietly planted them in the ground. Mourners read names of some of the victims as candles flickered in the dark. The crowd then sang the national anthem. The attack at a university in Garissa on Thursday killed 147 people, mostly students. The Al-Shabaab militant group claimed responsibility. As the country mourned the victims, others took to social media to humanize them by sharing their stories. They talked about aspiring lawyers, doctors and teachers. \"I can't even look at pictures of the people killed without crying,\" said Mary Wambui, 32, who lives in Nakuru, hundreds of miles from Garissa. \"They were just children. They were trying to make a better life for themselves. Some were first to go to college in their communities. They died trying to get an education.\" Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber, Kenyans used social media to talk about the lives of the victims. They shared pictures of beaming faces, full of life and energy, in happier days. They talked about parents too shocked to speak after identifying their children's bodies. \"We need to talk about the bright futures cut short,\" said Boniface Mwangi, who organized the vigil. \"Today's meeting will be a calling to say, 'We need to remember the 147; they are not just a number.' We are trying to avoid remembering these people as just a number.\" Some students remain unaccounted for, and wailing relatives alternate their searches between hospitals and morgues. Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the names of the victims. At Uhuru Park, right next to the crosses, a bulletin board featured 32 photos of the young students. \"With the previous attacks, there's been a sense of the victims just being numbers,\"  Doreen Areri said. \"The idea behind this is to have faces behind the numbers. We need to hear their stories, their dreams.\" Kellie Murungi said she got some solace from the vigil. \"In 2010, I was in a grenade attack in downtown Nairobi and every time there's a terrorist attack, it hits too close to home,\" Murungi said. \" It's not just happened to me, but many others.\" The vigil was important for the healing process, she said, because \"we shouldn't have people walking around with scars.\" It was the deadliest attack in the nation since al Qaeda killed more than 200 people at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998. In the Garissa attack, the terrorists separated Christians from Muslims, making some recite verses from the Quran. Those who couldn't quote the holy book tried to flee the gunfire, but whizzing bullets sent them to the ground. Others scampered into closets and stayed there for hours. Images from the scene showed heaps of students, faces down, lying in pools of blood. \"Those images will haunt us forever,\" said Martin Otieno, 29, who lives in Nairobi. \"As a nation, we should never let this happen. We just can't.\" Kenya launched airstrikes Monday targeting Al-Shabaab's training camps in Somalia, according to a military source, adding that the strikes were not retribution for last week's massacre at the university. \"The latest attack of Al-Shabaab bases by the Kenya military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011. It is not a retaliation to the Garissa attack. The operation has been ongoing,\" the source said Monday. Kenyan authorities had intelligence beforehand that a university in Garissa could be attacked, yet the country's rapid response team was stuck in Nairobi for hours after the massacre awaiting transport, a police source said Monday. It's unclear why the elite team was stuck in the Kenyan capital about 230 miles (370 kilometers) west of the attack. Kenyan politicians and Nairobi-based journalists arrived on the scene before the team did. Once the team entered the university complex, the hourslong siege was quickly defused. But a government spokesman defended the response time. \"With the benefit of hindsight, you can always say things could have been done better,\" said Manoah Esipisu, a spokesman for Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. However, he added, Kenyan authorities \"got the job done\" and saved lives. Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed echoed that sentiment in an interview with CNN on Monday. She denied reports that an elite rapid response team single-handedly ended the siege. \"We have a military garrison in Garissa, and the work began immediately after the attack was reported and continued for a number of hours until we were able to rescue 663 students of the 800 students that had been taken hostage by these terrorists. So the response was adequate,\" she said. \"We did everything that we could do.\" Kenya's Interior Ministry named Mohamed Mohamud as the organizer of the attack. The  senior Al-Shabaab leader is also known by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, it said. The ministry offered  a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, or about $215,000, for information on his whereabouts. He is in charge of external operations against Kenya, according to a government document, and commands the militia along the border. Another terrorist involved in the attacks is Abdirahim Abdullahi, a Kenyan-Somali  and the son of a  government chief in Mandera, authorities said. Mandera is in northern Kenya. Dorm becomes scene of a slaughter. Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia, and its violence has spread to Kenya before.  In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, leaving 67 people dead. The terror group has intensified attacks in Kenya since the country sent troops to Somalia four years ago to help battle the militants. CNN's David McKenzie and Joseph Netto reported from Nairobi, and Faith Karimi reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed from Los Angeles.\n\noutput:",

Temperatures will rise to the lower 80s in most places today. There are no weather issues as far as rain is concerned and that will be the case probbaly into the first part of Friday\nTonight we will be warm and there will be some patchy low clouds and fog.

Wednesday will be the warmest day of this stretch with sunshine taking highs up to the low and middle 80s and a few places could possibly set record high temperatures for the day.\nYou will likely notice humidity levels going up over the next few days especially as the wind turns more southeast with time. That will start to impact temperatures some beginning Thursday. We will probably have clouds to start the day with the long nights producing low clouds and fog, and then developing sunshine taking highs to the mid and upper 70s.\nA cold front will approach Friday as low pressure moves east across the Great Lakes and into Southeastern Canada. The front will be slowing down as it heads east and this is going to be due to Tropical Storm Philippe which will be moving up the east coast offshore. Philippe will be headed possibly for Nova Scotia over the weekend so the front slows until the tropical cyclone moves northward and then swing through the Eastern US Friday night and Saturday.\nFriday we will see arriving clouds and perhaps a couple of scattered showers during the day. Friday highs will be in the mid to upper 70s. Showers and a few thunderstorms will become more numerous overnight into Saturday and it looks like we will have to wait until late in the day Saturday for a front to pass and for showers to end. Saturday highs will be in the upper 60s to around or just over 70. The front moves offshore and then we see the arrivial of much cooler air and also the beginning of what will be a new pattern for next week and beyond. Sunday will be colder with clouds and some sun along with the chance for an instability shower. Highs will just be in the upper 50s and lower 60s.

        "prompt": "Summarize the following news within 102 words:\nFlu Vaccines Actually Work, Just Not in the Way You'd Expect\nAs autumn leaves begin to fall, the familiar call to arm ourselves against the flu with a vaccine resounds. This year, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is taking a fresh approach with their \"Wild to Mild\" campaign. Using animals as metaphors, the campaign highlights the vaccine's ability to weaken the flu's ferocity, transforming it from a roaring lion to a gentle kitten:\nWhile many have been conditioned to think of vaccines in binary terms—either they prevent illness or they don't—the reality is more intricate.\nDr. Sarah Bauerle Bass, a health communication expert at Temple University, points out that while some vaccines, like those for measles and polio, offer near-complete protection, the flu vaccine operates differently. This is primarily because the flu virus is a master of disguise, constantly evolving and presenting new challenges for our immune defenses.\nUnlike the static nature of measles or polio, the flu is a dynamic adversary. It's a collection of viruses, and the vaccine typically targets only a select few strains. These strains are chosen based on predictions from the Southern Hemisphere's flu activity, a method that, while scientifically grounded, isn't foolproof.\nTo the casual observer, the flu vaccine might seem less effective, with protection rates hovering between 40-60% during well-matched seasons. This has led to a pervasive myth that the vaccine is subpar. However, this perspective misses the broader picture as the vaccine's primary goal isn't just to prevent infection but to mitigate the severe consequences of the flu.\nSo, while the vaccine might not always prevent a runny nose, it's adept at shielding vital organs from the virus, reducing hospitalizations and saving lives. The \"Wild to Mild\" initiative aims to recalibrate public understanding, emphasizing the vaccine's role in transforming a potentially lethal illness into a more manageable one.\nHowever, the public's relationship with vaccines has evolved over the decades. Dr. Howard Markel, a medical historian, notes that while vaccines were once celebrated as miraculous gifts, modern perceptions are more varied and, at times, skeptical. This skepticism has extended to the COVID vaccine, which, like the flu vaccine, has faced misconceptions about its efficacy.\nDespite these challenges, the CDC remains optimistic. While not everyone will choose to get vaccinated, the goal is to reach the undecided majority with compelling messaging. The \"Wild to Mild\" campaign encapsulates the essence of the flu vaccine: it might not be perfect, but it's a powerful tool we have right now.\noutput:",

Coleman is accused of killing his two young children in Mexico with a spearfishing gun, claiming they possessed 'serpent DNA'.\nThe decision came on Wednesday, October 9, when the judge announced that Coleman was not competent for the trial. This announcement also implies that any further criminal proceedings against him will be halted.\nAs reported, Coleman's tragic actions were heavily influenced by the QAnon conspiracy theories. In his admission to the FBI, he mentioned that he believed his actions were the only solution to \"save the world.\"\nInvestigations revealed that in August 2021, Coleman drove his kids from their Santa Barbara residence to a ranch in Mexico. Two days into their stay, he took the life of his 2-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter using a speargun. Following the murders, Coleman returned to his motel room. It was a ranch worker who discovered the lifeless bodies of the children and reported the gruesome sight to the authorities. Coleman's arrest took place at the US border while he was trying to return.\nMatthew Coleman's spouse, during her interactions with the officials, confirmed that he had left with their kids in the family van without mentioning their destination. Even though he hadn't given her a clue about their whereabouts, she was optimistic that her children were safe. She also indicated that there had been no discord between the couple preceding his departure.\nDocuments presented in court reveal more about the family's plans that fateful day. They were supposedly set for a camping trip, but Coleman unexpectedly left with the kids. His wife, referenced as AC in the documents, grew worried, particularly because Coleman hadn't taken the car seat with him. She tried reaching him via text and calls to no avail. When approached by law enforcement, AC expressed her belief that Coleman would eventually come back and that she wasn't in danger. She further declined any immediate assistance.\nThe court has scheduled a status hearing for December 1, with a competency review set for March 8, 2024.\noutput:",

Decades and still no identity\nLost Among Us: The Silent Cry of Baby Jane Doe #61\nLos Angeles was left heartbroken on a day in late summer. On August 19, 1985, amidst the bustling city sounds, silence roared from an alley in Baldwin Hills (4206 Santo Tomas). Here, a life was stolen too soon. The fragile remains of a 10-month-old child, whom the world would come to remember as Baby Jane Doe #61, lay as a testament to the profound neglect she endured. The child, with an innocence that was prematurely ended, was discovered emaciated. Investigations later confirmed a life lost to pneumonia, a result of harrowing malnutrition. This grievous neglect declared her passing as a criminal act, an act of homicide.\nBut, amidst this despair, a glimmer of perhaps a once cherished life showed – her ears bore delicate piercings, hinting at moments of care. The investigative team could find no indications of any s exual assault. However, physical scars and memories of broken bones that had healed over time painted a harrowing story of physical abuse. Strangely, her teeth seemed larger than one would expect for a child her age.\nA chilling aspect of this heartbreaking story was the void surrounding her identity. None of the missing children records matched her description. No cries of a missing baby echoed in the alleys of Los Angeles. It seemed as though she was a ghost, forgotten by the world.\nDecades have since passed, and Baby Jane Doe #61's identity is still cloaked in mystery. Even as media, in its sporadic attempts, tried to shed light on her story, no one stepped forward. The secrets locked within her DNA still await the key – a family member's matching DNA – to unveil her true identity.\nThe memory of a petite figure, 2 feet 2 inches in height, weighing a mere 14 pounds, with dark, perhaps once lively eyes and flowing brown or black hair, lingers on. Time has eroded the features of her face, but a skilled forensic artist attempted to bring her image back to life. A hopeful representation of what she might have looked like graces the top of this article. Had fate been kinder, Baby Jane Doe #61 would have been celebrating her 34th year.\nIf your heart holds any clue, or if a memory sparks, please reach out to the Los Angeles Police Department at 1-877-LAPD 24-7 (1-877-527-3247).

Now he is feeling the pressure of handling the migrant crisis in his own city. Last week, he voiced his concerns over the migrant crisis in his own City.\nSince Texas began bussing migrants to Denver last December, former Mayor Michael Hancock was in charge to handle the arrival and their support.\nGovernor Jared Polis was planning to bus migrants to the sanctuary cities of Chicago and New York City. Both mayors complained and the plan to bus them there ended.\nNow that Mayor Johnston is running the City, he was interviewed by CNN on October 6 to discuss the currency situation and the 23,390 migrants the City supports.\nMayor Johnson said in the interview according to Denver 7:\n“They’re not asking for help. They’re not asking for charity. What they want is just the chance that everyone wants, to chase the American Dream and be able to work.”\n“We have people here who want to work, we have employers who want to hire them, we have a Congress who stood in the way of their ability to do that. I think that's the biggest challenge we see right now.”\n“We know if people are here without work authorization, we are going to need more federal support to support them. But our focus is really trying to get them access to work.”\n“We think if you bring someone to the country and tell them they can't work, there's no choice but to either encourage them to break the law or to make them survive on public subsidy and we think neither of those are good options.”\nIn addition, Denver sent letters to border town officials asking migrants not to come to the City. Letters were sent to Brownsville, El Paso, Houston, and Dallas according to Daily Mail.\nDenver is struggling to handle the current crisis.\nYou can see more details in this video:\nDo you think Denver can support more migrants?\noutput:",

It is the third record-setting year in a row.\" -New York Times, October 22, 2023\nAgainst the backdrop of that news, here's a snapshot of events over the past few days along the Texas-Mexico border, to show you how things are going:\nRio Grande Valley Border Patrol Agents are encountering migrants in very large groups crossing into the state. The photo above of a group of 172 migrants was taken last week. Border Patrol Officers apprehended 2,344 migrants last week in the Rio Grande Valley alone.\nBorder Patrol Agents are also encountering migrants in large numbers when raiding so-called \"stash houses\" where human smugglers hold them until they can move them deeper into the state. Pictured above are 42 migrants found in El Paso motel rooms last week.\nThis unprecedented surge of illegal crossings has human smugglers moving larger \"loads\" of migrants through Texas. The photo above is of a group of 34 migrants found inside a travel trailer last week by local authorities and Border Patrol Agents in Willacy County.\nIf you can think of a way to move through South Texas, chances are you'll find migrants using it - like the freight train shown above in Uvalde. I've written about human smugglers using Texas trains before. You can read more about that HERE.\nOf course, smugglers are moving more than migrants across the border into Texas.

That pass, the Disney Pixie Dust Pass, will now cost Sunshine State residents $439 ($21.88 per month excluding taxes), a $40 increase. Meanwhile, for park goers who want a more inclusive experience in the parks, the Disney Incredi-Pass, their highest-tiered pass, went up by $50, from $1,449 to $1,449 (or $111.52 per month).\nParking at the House of the Mouse will also be a little more expensive. Prices at Walt Disney World will increase $5, to $30, which, according to UPI News, will bring its parking prices more in line with Orlando’s other giant theme park resorts. To make up for the increase in ticket prices, the company is bringing back All Day Park Hopper Access to annual pass holders.\nAccording to its Disney Parks blog, starting on January 9th, annual pass holders will now be able to visit any of Disney World’s parks at any time of the day during operating hours. Currently, Park Hopper Access is only available after 2 p.m. Other changes being made for annual passholders include a return to complimentary self-parking at all Disney World Resort hotels, and the return of parking trams, which were halted during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe raise in ticket and parking prices comes as The Walt Disney Company is preparing to spend over $60 billion in its parks over the next 10 years, which also includes the company’s overseas theme parks and the Disney Cruise Line.\nArticle by Kareem Gantt\noutput:",

After meticulous police investigations, which included phone records and surveillance footage, the perpetrator, a coworker obsessed with the victim, was apprehended and sentenced to life without parole.\nOn the early morning of October 28, 2020, Fox's boyfriend discovered her lifeless body, having been shot twice in the head, in their driveway. Despite the gloomy weather, the Stark County Sheriff's Office sprung into action, recognizing the importance of evidence like her discarded cellphone nearby. \"Such devices carry invaluable data,\" commented Sgt. Craig Kennedy.\nAs officers peeled back layers of the victim's life, a troubling narrative emerged, pointing to Jason Alan McDermitt, a coworker. Although initially McDermitt's alibi seemed strong, his infatuation with Fox became evident as detectives delved deeper. They found thousands of videos and photos of Fox on McDermitt’s device, many taken covertly, revealing an unhealthy obsession.\nFurther cementing McDermitt's involvement was surveillance footage showing his vehicle near Fox’s home around the estimated time of the murder, contradicting his earlier claims. Coupled with a damning video of him meticulously cleaning his car post-murder and tire track evidence matching his vehicle at the crime scene, authorities had ample evidence.\nIn court, the emotional climax came when Fox’s 11-year-old daughter bravely faced McDermitt, condemning him for depriving her of a mother's love and milestones. \"Monsters were myths, until you proved me wrong,\" she said, highlighting the profound pain he inflicted on many.\nNow, as McDermitt serves a life sentence, the harrowing case serves as a stark reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows, sometimes closer than we think.

This nationwide interruption is just a test – a part of FEMA's routine to ensure the reliability and efficiency of its Emergency Alert System.\nTesting Times: When to Expect the Alert\nScheduled for 2:20 p.m. EDT, this alert will roll out across various time zones, including:\n1:20 p.m. CDT\n12:20 p.m. MDT\n11:20 a.m. PDT\nPhones will display a clear message: “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.” Spanish-speaking users can expect the notification to read: “ESTA ES UNA PRUEBA del Sistema Nacional de Alerta de Emergencia. No se necesita acción.”\nThat Familiar Tone: A Blast from the Past\nJeremy Edwards, FEMA's spokesperson, stated that the alert will be the very same audio tone familiar to countless Americans. Rooted in history, this unique sound dates back to 1963, established by President John F. Kennedy, marking the inception of the original Emergency Broadcast System.\nInterestingly, this tone isn't just for nationwide alerts. Over 1,700 local, state, territorial, and tribal authorities use this very sound for localized emergency alerts.\nWhy The Test?\nThe main aim of these tests is to evaluate the effectiveness of FEMA's alert systems. Conducted once every three years, the last test was as recent as Aug. 11, 2021. A potential reschedule is in the cards for Oct. 11, should there be severe weather or significant events.\nWho Will Get the Message?\nWhile the majority will receive the alert, there are exceptions. Phones that are off, set to airplane mode, or not within cell tower coverage might not get the alert. Additionally, some older phones might miss out, especially if the user is on a call.\nA Word of Caution\nIt's vital to differentiate real alerts from casual references. The FCC recently proposed a hefty fine for FOX, resulting from the inappropriate use of EAS tones during an NFL promo segment. The intent is clear: these tones have a unique purpose, and its sanctity must be preserved.\nIn conclusion, come Wednesday, when that familiar tone sounds, remember it's a test.

Elizabeth began a life of p rostitution soon after relocating, with her husband, Larry Vasser, acting as her pimp.\nThe mystery began on December 1 when Elizabeth was reported missing. While a woman's remains were found in the Mississippi River two weeks later, they would not be identified as Elizabeth's for another seven years. Throughout this period, concern grew for two-year-old Cherie's safety. The last reported sighting of the child was with stepfather Larry Vasser on January 7, 1987, in Kansas City, Missouri. Cherie's fate remains unknown to this day.\nWhen questioned, Vasser told police that Cherie was with relatives and had been given a new identity in Kansas City Missouri. Offering to provide recent photos of Cherie as evidence, he demanded $500 from an elderly woman in exchange.\nIn a disturbing revelation, Vasser allegedly confessed to his probation officer in 1988 about strangling his wife in 1986. There were also whispers of an accusation against Vasser in 1987 for attempting a kidnapping, although the outcomes of these investigations remain cloaked in uncertainty.\nGiven the circumstances, if Cherie is still alive, it's likely she remains oblivious to her traumatic past and may not realize she's a missing individual. The case is classified as a non-family abduction, since Cherie was supposed to be in the custody of Elizabeth's mother. However, authorities have not dismissed the possibility of a more sinister outcome.\nAt the time of her disappearance, Cherie was 4 feet tall, weighed 80 pounds, with brown hair and eyes. She is biracial, with a white mother and Black father.

This is part of the regular biannual time adjustment that has an impact on most, but not all, Americans.In the following year, on 2024, daylight saving time will commence again in March, causing us to move our clocks forward and lose one hour of sleep. The purpose behind gaining an hour in November, rather than losing one in the spring, is to make room for more daylight in the mornings. Conversely, when we \"spring forward\" in March, the intention is to extend daylight during the summer evenings. It is worth mentioning that in the Northern Hemisphere, the autumnal equinox occurred on September 23rd, signifying the commencement of the fall season. Daylight saving time is a biannual occurrence that impacts most Americans, whether they are ready for it or not.\nOn November 5th, our clocks are set backward by an hour, providing us with an additional hour of rest. This adjustment is designed to allow for more daylight in the mornings during the fall and winter seasons. However, it is important to note that not all Americans are affected by this time change, as there are some states and territories that do not observe daylight saving time.Looking ahead to 2024, daylight saving time will once again take place in March, resulting in us losing an hour of sleep. This shift is focused on extending daylight during the summer evenings, as we \"spring forward\" our clocks. It is interesting to consider the timing of these time adjustments in relation to the autumnal equinox, which occurred on September 23rd in the Northern Hemisphere, marking the beginning of the fall season. As we approach daylight saving time, it is important for individuals to be aware of these changes and adjust their schedules accordingly to minimize any disruptions in their daily routines.\nSource:\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/10/02/daylight-saving-time-2023/70971436007/\noutput:",

A few reports also came from North Dakota and as far south as Omaha, Nebraska.\nUnlike past Earthbound CMEs that hit early this year and were heavily reported about, this one had slower solar wind speeds and wasn't projected to be as strong. The overall weak nature of this CME caused many Aurora hunters who watch the charts to signal the arrival of the CME hitting Earth to miss it since the spike we are so used to seeing was not present in this setup.\nInstead, the only other hints that the Northern Lights might be present this time around and the arrival of the CME was a gap in the data from the satellites as the CME hit them, an ever so subtle increase in the solar winds, and a gradual decrease in the Bz values (Negative Bz), which means the solar energy is aligning with Earth's magnetic field favoring better odds the lights can be seen further south in the United States. Something Charlie Bourdo caught hours before the event unfolded Friday night!\nDo you want to learn more about the Northern Lights and how to forecast them better?

States including Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Omaha, Nebraska, experienced the display. Aurora hunters missed the event due to the absence of the usual spike in data, but subtle increases in solar winds and decreasing Bz values signaled its arrival.

McMaster testified in front of Congress over concerns posed by the Chinese government and their rising influence in global markets.\nOne of which is food security, a point brought up recently by South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson who said, “Food security is national security,\" he said. \"And I think we've seen that Russia was able to exercise undue influence over Europe because they supplied them [with] so much natural gas. And similarly, if China has control over food supplies in South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, even in North America, that can give them more power,more coercive power, over the globe.\"\nLawmakers and authorities are also showing concern as China increases their foothold in Michigan one farm at a time.\nMichigan lawmakers Tom Kundse, R-Clare, and Matt Hall Richland, have introduced legislation that would make it illegal for “certain foreign ownership of certain real estate,” thereby making it harder for Chinese owned companies to buy Michigan farmland.\nNow, many experts believe that China owning land isn’t exactly a threat to U.S. security as evidenced by Michigan State agricultural economist William Knudsen saying, “If I was worried about foreign ownership of the food supply I would not focus on land,” he said. “I’m focused on things like owning seed companies, major grain shippers and handlers because that’s where the choke points are in the agri-food supply chain.”\nBut there are other concerns with foreign land buyers.\nOne is the price of land. It is hard for Michigan farmers to compete with foreign buyers, which makes it harder for farmers to increase their farm size as well as deterring young farmers from starting out.\nCurrently, Michigan has 1.4 million acres of foreign held farmland, per the USDA. Most of this is held by German and Italian entities. Michigan ranks sixth in the country in foreign held farmland.\nRight now, Chinese owned companies own 44,000 in the Midwest and it is increasing each year.\nRecently, China has been making a number of investments in the state of Michigan, including a hotly contested battery factory in Green Charter Township.\noutput:",

On March 5, 2023, Dexter Wade of Jackson, Mississippi, went missing after leaving his residence. Ten days later, his concerned mother, Bettersen Wade, reported his mysterious absence to the local police.\nIt has been unearthed that a mere hour after his departure that day, an off-duty corporal from the Jackson Police Department fatally hit Dexter while he was crossing Interstate 55 in Jackson. The highway, which is in close proximity to Bettersen Wade's residence, is a busy thoroughfare with six lanes.\nWhile a post-mortem revealed that Dexter had sustained major head injuries and had traces of PCP and methamphetamine in his system, he wasn't carrying any identification. However, a prescription bottle discovered in his pocket led Hinds County investigator, LaGrand Elliot, to identify the victim as Dexter Wade. By March 9, after confirming Dexter's identity, Elliot claims to have handed over the information to the Jackson Police Department’s accident investigation unit for them to break the tragic news to his next of kin, Bettersen.\nContrary to expectations, Bettersen received no communication about her son's tragic fate. Despite her consistent efforts and numerous inquiries to the Jackson Police Department, she was continuously informed that there were no updates on Dexter.\nFurther adding to the tragedy, on July 14, 2023, without informing the family, the county interred Dexter in an anonymous pauper’s grave. It wasn't until August 24, 2023, more than five months after Dexter's disappearance, that Bettersen was finally contacted by a new investigator, informing her that an officer would visit her.\nFeeling the weight of the looming news, Bettersen stated to NBC, \"When she said that, I felt in my heart he was gone.
